In this breach, the hacker managed to trigger an unauthorised sale of 600 million GALA tokens, valued at just over 20 million dollars. Yet, this is not the first controversy the company has encountered with 130 million dollars of GALA tokens being stolen in September 2023.   Whilst a painful experience for holders of the token, as markets saw a negative impact on token price with both of these incidents, it\u2019s a painful reminder that investing in crypto is still a risky endeavour, even when markets are in the green.",

This decision comes after months of anticipation following the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.   However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean Ether ETFs are available for trading just yet. The SEC still needs to review individual applications from asset managers for each of the eight proposed Ether ETFs. This process could take several weeks, but some analysts believe it may be fast-tracked due to the initial approval.",
