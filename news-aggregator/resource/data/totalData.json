    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nA blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that invests exclusively in a basket of blockchain-based companies. The companies held by a blockchain ETF have business operations in blockchain technology or invest or profit from the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are distinct from cryptocurrency ETFs, which invest in a basket of digital currencies such as bitcoin. However, a blockchain ETF can provide exposure to some of the technologies that are exploring digital ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain ETFs\n\nA blockchain is a shared ledger that stores all information regarding a transaction (date, time, dollar amount, etc.). This ledger is decentralized, meaning it is not kept in one location but distributed across a network that can be viewed by the public. The information in the ledger is also incorruptible.\n\nProponents believe that blockchain technology can enable people to communicate crucial data in a safe, tamper-proof manner. Just about anything can be recorded and stored on a blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a chance to make money from this technology, which has the potential to revolutionize business and be used by everyone. These funds invest in various companies making money from blockchain in some form. Some of them are actively managed while others are passively managed and simply track a specific index.\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer dual benefits—pooled investments in baskets of stocks like that of a mutual fund, and real-time trading with tick-by-tick price changes like that of a stock.\n\nApplications of Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. This technology isn’t just limited to digital currencies, though. Blockchain can potentially be used in any situation where data recordkeeping is required.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to deliver information in a quick, secure, and transparent fashion, even between mutually distrustful parties. Those characteristics have led some proponents to predict that blockchain could end up being as groundbreaking as the internet was.\n\nHow Blockchain Works\n\nA blockchain can in some way be compared to spreadsheets. It is essentially a database where information is entered and stored. Where a blockchain differs from a spreadsheet is in how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nThe blockchain process essentially takes the following steps:Different Services/Industries That Blockchain Is Used in\n\nThousands of cryptocurrency systems run on a blockchain. But that’s not the technology’s only use. Companies in many other industries have explored pilots using blockchains and similar ledger technology to store data for other types of transactions. Proponents believe that it can speed transaction times, demand less oversight and resources, and is harder to hack and manipulate.\n\nThose benefits have prompted several big-name companies to invest in blockchain. Industries that have seen a use for blockchain include:Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe terms bitcoin and blockchain are sometimes used interchangeably, despite being two different things: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while blockchain is the underlying database technology.\n\nBlockchain is not tied to any one specific company or product. it is a technology that can be used across various industries. Blockchain ETFs invest in various companies listed on the stock market, many of which also have other operations outside of blockchain, rather than a specific coin. This makes them more diversified and less volatile.\n\nAnother notable difference is regulation and availability. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been heavily scrutinized by government authorities. For many years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resisted applications by companies seeking to launch a cryptocurrency ETF, citing fears of market manipulation. The first bitcoin futures ETF in the United States was approved in October 2021, and the first bitcoin spot ETF in January 2024.\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs come with additional risks due to the inherent volatility of digital currency. In addition, they may have higher expense ratios due to the cost of custodying digital assets.\n\nCriticism of Blockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs are a relatively recent phenomenon. As such, it is difficult to determine trends or derive conclusive results from their performance.\n\nMany blockchain ETFs have witnessed positive returns.However, investors are still concerned with the long-term prospects of blockchain ETFs. As is the case with any breakthrough technology, there is no guarantee blockchain will live up to its potential and become widely used across multiple industries.\n\nBlockchain ETFs also come with the inherent risk of investing in technology-based startups, at least while the blockchain concept is still evolving, and hitting regulatory roadblocks across the globe.\n\nExample of Blockchain ETFs\n\nTwo popular blockchain ETFs include the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) ETF and the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETF.\n\nThe Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy seeks to replicate the returns of the Siren Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, an index made up of global companies committed to blockchain development. The fund is described as passive but does have some discretion in selecting companies.\n\nAs of January 2024, BLCN, which was one of the first ETFs to focus on blockchain technology, had $71.8 million in assets under management and a five-year annualized return of 4.38%. Its top holdings are Galaxy Digital Holdings, Coinbase Global, Inc., and Microstrategy Inc., with an expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nThe Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF is an actively managed fund investing in companies developing or using what it calls “transformational data sharing technologies.” It has no underlying index and carries an expense ratio of 0.75%.\n\nThe fund, as of January 2024, has assets under management of $850 million and a five-year annualized return of 17.55%. BLOK invests 47% of its assets in technology services and 19% in financial services. Its top holdings, as of October 2023, are Coinbase Global, Inc., Microstrategy, Inc., and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a way to potentially make money from blockchain technology. These ETFs spread their bets on a number of companies at the forefront of blockchain, a technology that some people believe could be as groundbreaking as the internet.\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. But it isn’t just limited to that. Many industries need to record, safely store, and track data, and blockchain has been touted as an effective way to do this.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "title": "Permissioned Blockchain: Definition, Examples, Vs. Permissionless\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Permissioned blockchains require participants to identify themselves and assign defined roles to perform only permitted activities.\n\nPermissioned blockchains provide an additional level of security over typical blockchain systems like Bitcoin, as they require an access control layer. These blockchains are favored by entities who require security, identity, and role definition within the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are becoming more common as businesses realize their benefits.\n\nTechnically, properly conceived permissioned blockchain networks have an access-control layer built into the blockchain nodes.\n\nMuch of the time, businesses creating or using a \"blockchain\" are not using a blockchain; they build a distributed ledger with a consensus mechanism for verifying transactions. It can be tough to distinguish the difference because there is not yet a set definition that truly separates blockchain and DLT.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Permissioned Blockchain?\n\nA permissioned blockchain is a distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible. It can only be accessed by users with permissions. The users can only perform specific actions granted to them by the ledger administrators and are required to identify themselves through certificates or other digital means.\n\nYou might consider the addition of permissioned users as an extra blockchain security system. Administrators maintain an access control layer to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants. Records are kept within the blockchain of who is involved in the transactions. This makes permissioned blockchains different from public blockchains.\n\nUnderstanding Permissioned Blockchains\n\nA blockchain can be built and accessed in multiple ways. Some blockchains need special permissions to read, access, and write information. Others only require that you have the ability to connect and can conduct work for the network. The intrinsic configuration of each blockchain controls the participants\u0027 transactions and defines their roles in which each participant can access and contribute to the blockchain.\n\nIt may also include maintaining the identity of each blockchain participant on the network. Such blockchains are called permissioned blockchains.\n\nDifference Between Permissionless and Permissioned Blockchains\n\nPermissioned blockchains are similar to permissionless blockchains because they use the same technologies. However, permissioned blockchains do not allow users to access the blockchain without identification.\n\nFor example, a bank may be running a permissioned blockchain operated through a designated number of nodes internal to the bank to track money transfers. You cannot access this blockchain because you don\u0027t have the permissions required. In contrast, you could join a permissionless blockchain like a cryptocurrency mining network once you have established a semi-anonymous account in that network.\n\nMuch of the inner workings of the blockchains are the same. The key differences between them are:Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency permissionless blockchain, allows anyone to participate in the network in the capacity of a full node or a contributing miner. Anyone can take a read-only role or make legitimate changes to the blockchain, like adding a new block or maintaining a full copy of the entire blockchain.\n\nAs blockchain uses grow and mature, more businesses and governments have realized the cost-saving benefits the technology introduces into an organization. As a result, permissioned blockchains have become popular among industry-level firms and enterprises, for which security, identity, and role definition are essential.\n\nFor instance, a manufacturer producing a product may use a permissioned blockchain that ties into its supply chain management. The transactions on this blockchain would likely involve logistics partners, financing banks, and other vendors involved in the supply and financing processes. Each entity would have its own level of transparency and permissions that it could use to streamline operations, track inventory, or monitor spending and invoicing.\n\nPermissionless blockchains have a broad decentralization in that they allow for more users and can extend across a much larger network. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains have limited decentralization as they are generally used for enterprise and business purposes, requiring various amounts of centralization.\n\nGenerally, permissionless blockchains are open source, which means that a community develops them; they can be changed and used by anyone. Permissioned blockchains are generally proprietary and controlled by the developers or the business using them.\n\nA developer building a permissioned blockchain may opt to make a few select records, like product name and quantity involved in a transaction, available for everyone to read. However, only select participants are allowed to view the transaction price. Other implementations may include limiting participants to act as nodes on the network, enhancing the network\u0027s security.\n\nAll such permissioning and profile maintenance is handled by this access-control layer. These differ from the un-permissioned or public blockchain networks, which don’t have a control layer.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are much less transparent since they provide a certain amount of anonymity for the users. Wallet addresses cannot generally be tracked back to the blockchain users, and transactions are encrypted using various cryptography methods.\n\nPermissioned blockchains require more transparency at certain levels since they are used for conducting business. Nodes, or the users and their connections, are known and their transactions are visible. Among many other benefits, this can defend a company against double invoicing, spending, paying, or any other number of errors that can be made using enterprise management programs.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Proponents of blockchain believe in the technology’s disruptive potential. Find out which industries blockchain is likely to disrupt in coming years.\n\nBlockchain technology can improve all organizations, regardless of industry, by enhancing human resource management and accounting processes. Enterprises in the private sector, from insurance companies to manufacturers to philanthropies, can uniquely benefit from blockchain technology. Almost every entity and service in the public sector—such as elections—could be improved by incorporating blockchain technology.\n\n",
    "content": "Even as digital currencies fade from widespread interest or become illegal or heavily regulated, blockchain technology is likely here to stay. That’s because it has tremendous flexibility and the ability to disrupt almost every industry and sector of the market. It has the potential to touch every company’s accounting, corporate governance, and human resources departments. But it may also profoundly impact sectors such as banking, cloud computing, healthcare, insurance, and real estate.\n\nWidespread Disruption Across Industries\n\nThere are some ways that blockchain technology can benefit all organizations, regardless of industry, such as:Blockchain technology can benefit accountants by automating data collection and organization and many routine accounting functions like payroll. Blockchain tech can potentially reduce instances of human error and fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology can increase the transparency of how an organization is governed through smart contracts—electronic agreements that automatically execute based on predetermined conditions. Blockchain technology can also enable shareholder voting by proxy and collaboration on proposals.\n\nManaging human resources can become more efficient by using blockchain technology. Smart contracts can perform functions like conducting background checks and verifying employment histories more quickly.\n\nPrivate-Sector Disruptions\n\nBlockchain may have a specific and profound impact on some specific industries and market sectors. For example:The legal cannabis industry is tightly regulated, which creates an opportunity for blockchain technology to make regulatory compliance for cannabis companies more efficient. Blockchain tech can increase the transparency of the cannabis supply chain, boosting the safety of the product and proving its legal status.\n\nBlockchain technology may help to decentralize cloud computing, making cloud technology’s use of computing resources and data storage more efficient. Decentralizing data storage could also make cloud-based networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain-based web browsers may change how online advertising works. Blockchain tech can enable companies to advertise directly to internet users, with consumers receiving fewer ads that are better targeted to their interests.\n\nA blockchain-based distributed ledger can track the histories, provenances, and archival materials for collectible art pieces. The arts are already being disrupted by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—which also use blockchain technology—being used to signify ownership of digital art.\n\nBlockchain technology is well suited to making food and beverage supply chains safer and more efficient. Food supply chains on a blockchain are more transparent, which enables tracing contamination to its source to occur more quickly. Certifications like being organic could also be more easily verified, with blockchain technology providing more visibility into the supply chain.\n\nDistributed ledgers enabled by blockchain tech can enable gamers to transport personas, skill sets, and digital assets across gaming platforms.\n\nHospital systems and other healthcare networks could use blockchain technology to share data, including patient records, more efficiently and securely. Permissioned blockchains may enable records to be efficiently shared without compromising privacy.\n\nBlockchain technology could help to establish consensus among the various parties involved with insurance claims, making processing claims more efficient. The technology could also facilitate cross-border insurance coverage and payments.\n\nThere are many ways that blockchain tech can potentially improve internet security. Blockchain technology could eliminate the need for human intermediaries, significantly reducing fraud, corruption, and human error. Blockchain tech can also make Internet of Things (IoT) networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain technology can bring much-needed transparency to online gambling, potentially disrupting the ability of digital casinos to tilt the odds in their favor. Players can also potentially maintain greater anonymity through blockchain-based betting platforms.\n\nBlockchain technology can potentially speed up the pharmaceutical industry’s drug discovery, which is notoriously slow, by enabling more and better collaboration among researchers. The drug development process can become safer with blockchain tech increasing the transparency of the process.\n\nPhotographic licensing and copyright information can be managed and stored using blockchain tech. Photographers and creators can use the technology to connect directly with their supporters and control their pricing and distribution.\n\nApplying blockchain technology to real estate transactions could make transferring property more efficient. Blockchain tech can potentially record and track real estate transactions and ensure documentation accuracy.\n\nBlockchain platforms could significantly disrupt the retail industry, including brick-and-mortar stores and ecommerce. Decentralized marketplaces can enable buyers and sellers to connect directly, which could lower prices by eliminating the markups charged by retailers. Sellers could avoid fees and restrictions traditionally imposed by retailers. Potentially, retailers can use blockchain technology to enhance gift card and loyalty programs.\n\nPublic-Sector Disruption\n\nBlockchain technology is also increasingly in use by the public sector. Government agencies, more than private-sector enterprises, are plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiencies that blockchain technology can potentially remedy. Blockchain tech can also make governments more transparent and potentially less susceptible to corruption.\n\nFor example, ensuring that voting processes are fair and accountable is a major concern worldwide. Some have posited that blockchain could help to enhance this process and increase reliability and security. Using blockchain technology, voting processes could potentially improve everything from voter registration to vote counting. The blockchain’s distributed ledgers are publicly accessible and immutable, which would increase transparency in the process. However, a 2020 report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) raised serious concerns about the security of blockchain voting.\n\nHow Blockchain Tech Is Disrupting Finance\n\nBlockchain technology, as the core component of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is already disrupting the payments sector of finance. But blockchain tech can potentially disrupt the payments sector even further, transforming several other subsectors within the finance industry.\n\nAdditionally, some companies have already used blockchain technology to develop global decentralized prediction markets. And blockchain could help streamline data organization in forecasting ranging from traffic models to the weather. Here are the financial sectors likely to see major disruption in the years to come:Companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology. With blockchain, users around the globe could gain access to banking opportunities that they wouldn’t otherwise have. Particularly, individuals in developing nations and without standard banks readily accessible can use blockchain to access these services.\n\nPartnering with digital currencies, blockchain could allow for instant transfers of money between countries without major fees and delay times. While some mainstream financial institutions in the United States were initially reluctant to delve into the cryptocurrency market, they were much less reticent about exploring the possibilities inherent in blockchain technology.\n\nCrowdfunding has risen to prominence in the past several years to become one of the most popular ways for individuals to raise funds for all kinds of projects and goals. At the source of crowdfunding is a relationship of trust between those seeking to fund a project and others willing to contribute donations to support those goals.\n\nCrowdfunding sites typically sustain themselves by charging fees for their services, acting as a middleman between project developers and givers. Blockchain could help reduce the need for a middleman, better connecting project managers to those willing to give efficiently.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBusinesses have already explored the ways that blockchain can revolutionize the way that:With the sheer number of industries and sectors that blockchain technology can potentially disrupt, it’s very likely that blockchain technology is here to stay. The impact on the world of blockchain tech will continue to grow as the technology also develops further.\n\n",

This impressive technology provides the support necessary for the decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. While blockchains allow for cryptocurrencies to function, their functionality has applications beyond cryptocurrency. In diverse countries such as India, Kenya, and East Africa, blockchain technology has found uses in banking and financial services, supply chains, agriculture, and in managing land ownership records.\n\nAs of June 2023, CoinMarketCap reported over 25,000 different types of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. In a study since, only 5% of all sales have been paid in bitcoin through the country\u0027s Chivo Wallet.\n\n",
    "content": "When most people hear the word blockchain, which refers to a type of decentralized ledger technology, they immediately connect the term with cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to keep in mind that bitcoin just happened to be one of blockchain’s earliest and most popular applications; most experts believe that the potential for other applications of blockchain technology is vast.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nIn the most general sense, a blockchain is a system for recording information, although it is distinct from a typical database in the way it stores information; the information in a blockchain is stored in such a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.\n\nBlockchain technology promises a secure, peer-to-peer mechanism for verifying information. Each \"block\" in a blockchain contains a record of transactions in a decentralized ledger. Taken together, the blocks form a “chain” in a peer-to-peer network.\n\nApplications for Blockchain Technology\n\nThis impressive technology provides the support necessary for the decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. While blockchains allow for cryptocurrencies to function, their functionality has applications beyond cryptocurrency. For example, banking and fintech payment companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology.\n\nFrom insurance and real estate to crowdfunding and data management, the potential applications of blockchain technology are numerous, and it\u0027s likely that there will continue to be new ways of adapting this technology to the mainstream business world in the future.\n\nHowever, there is one important use of blockchain technology that exists outside its more traditional business applications: Some of the world\u0027s emerging economies are benefiting from the integration of blockchain technology in various ways. In diverse countries such as India, Kenya, and East Africa, blockchain technology has found uses in banking and financial services, supply chains, agriculture, and in managing land ownership records.\n\nAmong its many advantages (first and foremost being its ability to keep data secure), blockchain technology also claims to speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, and boost financial inclusion by providing more opportunities for those without easy access to financial services.\n\nChallenges for Blockchain Implementation in Emerging Countries\n\nBefore we discuss opportunities, let\u0027s touch on why it may be particularly difficult for an emerging country to implement blockchain solutions. The hurdles below are not an exhaustive list but instead an overview of the unique challenges emerging countries must overcome.\n\nBanking Opportunities\n\nIn many parts of the world, individuals do not have easy access to banking services. With blockchain technology, users across the globe could access banking services where they otherwise wouldn\u0027t have the opportunity. Particularly, individuals in emerging economies where there are not standard banks readily accessible could make use of blockchain technology to access these services. One specific application is the use of blockchain for instant transfers of money between countries and without major fees and delay times.\n\nBlockchain also offers a visible, impermeable ledger, protecting the accuracy of financial transactions. This may lessen instances of fraud, corruption, and other wrongdoing that frequently occur in the banking industry. Emerging nations can improve the security and dependability of their banking systems, boosting user confidence, by utilizing the immutability and transparency of the blockchain.\n\nLast, access to credit is frequently restricted in emerging economies, especially for those without established credit histories. Blockchain can make it possible to develop decentralized credit scoring systems that use alternate data sources, including transaction records and payment histories, to evaluate creditworthiness. This could create opportunities for people and companies to receive loans and credit facilities based on their credit profiles created using blockchain technology.\n\nExamples of Blockchain in Emerging Countries\n\nIn India, ConsenSys Ventures, a blockchain software firm, has worked with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, the Indian government’s policy think tank, on implementing blockchain in a land titling project. ConsenSys Ventures also signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh state government for an array of uses for its technology, including in land titling, supply chains, and health records.\n\nIn Kenya, IBM partnered with Twiga Foods, a business-to-business logistics platform for kiosks and food stalls across Africa, to extend micro-finance loans to vendors. These loans were intended to help vendors buy and manage more inventory. IBM\u0027s contribution was to build a blockchain-enabled lending platform that could determine the creditworthiness of the food vendors.\n\nIn Nigeria, blockchain technology has been used to monitor toxin levels along the River Niger, where efforts are underway to clean up the river belt. International organizations that are funding these projects rely on this data as part of their reporting requirements.\n\nHaiti, the victim of hurricane and earthquake damage caused over the last decade, also stands to benefit from blockchain.\n\nThe Haitian government has suggested that blockchain technology could be used to record and register property transactions, voting, intellectual property, and other aspects of bureaucracy. In 2019, the La Banque de la République d’Haïti announced that it was considering a pilot program utilizing blockchain technology to create a digital version of the Haitian Gourde. The goal of this project would be to improve the domestic payments system and promote financial inclusion in Haiti.\n\nOver the past few years, the Business Development and Investment (BDI) project in Haiti has helped thousands of producers. The BDI project was designed to support the reconstruction efforts after Haiti\u0027s 2010 earthquake, but was forced to redouble its efforts due to natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, assassination of its President, lockdown due to socio-political unrest, and gang-fueled insecurity.\n\nThe project aimed to attract private sector investment through the creation of special industrial zones but later shifted to facilitating the export of existing high-quality agricultural products. To enable farmers to obtain higher prices, the project helped develop the capacity of third-party service providers, providing them with standard operating procedures, access to quality transport and logistics services, and supplying them with working capital. The entire project hinged on a blockchain solution for traceability and payments was developed, allowing direct payments to farmers.\n\nThe Future of Blockchain Technology in Emerging Economies\n\nFor Paul Domjan, former global head of research, analytics, and data at investment bank Tellimer (formerly Exotix), emerging nations are the most promising beneficiaries of blockchain tech. He argues that, because \"frontier markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia lag far behind [in the area of ownership recording], with average performance less than half that of the best-performing economies,\" they are primed for the benefits of blockchain.\n\nAmnesty International program director Mark Dummett has voiced cautious support for the integration of blockchain into efforts to address these and other problems plaguing developing nations, saying, \"You have to be wary of technological solutions to problems that are also political and economic, but blockchain may help. We\u0027re not against it.\"The Bottom Line\n\nBesides the applications listed above, supporters of blockchain believe that it could enhance the distribution of government services in these nations, help to provide identity services, and even help to enhance freedom of speech and anti-corruption activities as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Layer 1 and Layer 2: An Overview\n\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions are improvements to the throughput—or processing speed—of any cryptocurrency blockchain network. They can include protocol updates or additional network solutions to help process more transactions.\n\nLayer 1 includes updates such as changing block sizes, consensus mechanisms, or splitting the database into multiple parts (known as sharding). Layer 2 includes rollups (bundling transactions), parallel blockchains (known as side chains), and off-chain handling of transactions (known as state channels).\n\nWhy Layer 1 and Layer 2 Scaling Solutions Are Important\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized network of nodes that processes crypto transactions independently, with consensus protocols that verify the accuracy of the transactions. The transactions are then recorded sequentially, forming a chain of data blocks that can’t be changed.\n\nUnfortunately, the more popular a blockchain becomes (Bitcoin is a case in point), the more processing power it needs to handle its growing number of transactions. Cryptocurrency blockchain protocols also may limit the number of transactions that can be processed, creating a bottleneck in the network.\n\nThis has caused popular blockchain networks to become very slow, sometimes taking up to 10 minutes (or more) to process a transaction. To solve this issue, scaling activities have been developed to help provide a more efficient means of holding a much larger volume of transactions.\n\nThere are several ways to scale each network, and dozens of scaling solutions have been developed for various popular blockchains. These solutions help offload the transaction processing power onto other networks or improve the base-layer network itself through a code update.\n\nLayer 1 Blockchains vs. Layer 2 Blockchains\n\nA Layer 1 blockchain is the base architecture for a decentralized cryptocurrency network. Examples of Layer 1 blockchains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These blockchains handle transaction processing and network security through a shared consensus mechanism, such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS).\n\nA Layer 2 blockchain refers to another blockchain or set of protocols layered \"on top\" of a Layer 1 solution. Layer 2 protocols use the Layer 1 blockchain for network and security infrastructure but are more flexible in their ability to scale transaction processing and overall throughput on the network. Examples are Polygon (which layers on top of Ethereum) and Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network. Coinbase launched Base, its Ethereum Layer 2 network, in August 2023.\n\nTypes of Layer 1 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are several ways to scale Layer 1 blockchains, including:Some Layer 1 cryptocurrency blockchains have updated their code to increase the block size, allowing more transactions to be verified at a time, thus expanding the overall capacity of the network. An example of this is the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network, which upgraded its block size to 8 megabytes (MBs) from 1 MB, then further to 32 MBs, theoretically allowing it to process more than 100 transactions per second vs. Bitcoin’s seven transactions per second.\n\nThe consensus mechanism of a blockchain validates transactions to ensure the accuracy and security of the network. Bitcoin, for example, uses proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, requiring tremendous processing power to solve a cryptographic puzzle to be allowed to record the next block in the blockchain. Once the puzzle is solved, the blockchain confirms transactions in the blocks by verifying block hashes.\n\nEthereum also initially used PoW but has since upgraded to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which requires node operators to lock up a large Ether (ETH) deposit to process transactions.\n\nSharding is similar to database partitioning, which allows a blockchain database to be broken up into smaller parts so that transactions can be processed simultaneously. This increases the overall capacity of a Layer 1 blockchain network.\n\nTypes of Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are also several types of Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions, including:Instead of processing transactions individually, bundles of transactions can be “rolled up” into a single transaction, vastly increasing the number of transactions that can be processed at once. The transactions are outsourced to be recorded off-chain, bundled, and then brought onto the main chain to process as a single entity.\n\nSide chains are independent blockchain networks with their own set of validators that allow transactions to be processed in parallel. This vastly increases the transaction-processing power of a blockchain, but you must trust the integrity of the side chain network and the bridge network that connects it to the main blockchain.\n\nState channels are similar to a side chain, as transactions are recorded off-chain, but these transactions are recorded in bulk off-chain, and then the state of the channel is set at complete. The transactions are then recorded in bulk on the main blockchain network by broadcasting a completed “state” to the main network. This is how Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is set up.\n\nRisks of Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nWhile scaling a blockchain is a great way to improve transaction handling and increase overall adoption, there are a few risks inherent to using a scaling solution:The Bottom Line\n\nScaling a blockchain network is important to a cryptocurrency network\u0027s overall adoption and increased capacity. Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions help preserve the integrity of the underlying blockchain while improving the ability to handle far more transactions.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain may be the most important invention since the internet.\n\nLike many other top inventions, blockchain has more than one application or use case. Blockchain uses are being developed in the financial and healthcare industries, government, supply chains, and more. Many popular blockchains are slower than traditional financial systems; however, blockchain developers are working to increase speeds.\n\nDivision of information and how it is often channeled creates silos within governments, increasing inefficiency. Blockchain can solve this issue by securely distributing information to reach those who need it more quickly.\n\n",
    "content": "World-changing inventions like the printing press, the radio, and the internet opened new ways for people to communicate and share knowledge. In many cases, blockchain technology expands on these inventions. Blockchain provides a method to secure and distribute knowledge, data, and information so that it can be shared without alteration, interference, or be controlled.\n\nAlthough many contenders exist for the most important inventions, some people believe blockchain ranks among them. Read on to learn why blockchain might be one of the more important inventions of the early twenty-first century.\n\nBlockchain in Finance\n\nMoney does make the world go \u0027round, but there are also many issues surrounding its use. Here are some of the ways blockchain can be used in the financial industry.\n\nIt is natural for people to want as much money as possible, but with that desire comes the drive to get it in any way possible—many people resort to illegal or unethical means to fulfill their dreams of wealth.\n\nThe finance industry is teeming with temptations—money flows in and out of homes, businesses, and countries, and there never seems to be enough. There is so much capital circulating that it needs to be managed in a way that removes the temptation to act unethically.\n\nBlockchain can solve corruption issues within financial systems by eliminating the risk of duplicating or double-spending assets. Transactions are initiated, executed, recorded, encrypted, verified, and stored by nodes who manage \"an irreversible ledger of transactions\" and must reach a consensus to approve a new block—making it the perfect solution.\n\nThe primary reason behind creating blockchain and cryptocurrency was to create a decentralized method of exchanging value; in other words, transferring money to someone for services provided or goods received.\n\nTherefore, it can eliminate third parties like banks, payment processors, payment gateways, settlement banks, and other financial entities within our bloated and costly financial systems. Blockchain also allows people who do not have access to financial instruments like loans or other services to access them.\n\nCryptocurrency can be used if financial systems collapse. For example, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2021 and 2022, cryptocurrency became a major source of funding for the Ukrainians and the government—it recognized cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment in 2021.\n\nCryptocurrency was created using blockchain technology, but an unforeseen consequence of introducing cryptocurrency was that because it held exchangeable value, its value could fluctuate. People started paying for it, demand increased, prices rose, and investors saw an opportunity.\n\nCryptocurrencies are now widely purchased by investors as investments. It is also used by traders to make profits from price movements.\n\nBlockchain is revolutionizing banking and lending. Not only is it creating ways for consumers to lend to each other, but crypto lending companies have emerged that use blockchain in their loan approval process at significantly reduced costs. Costs are reduced because there are no lawyers, banks, paperwork, or other lengthy procedures.\n\nInsurance providers are exploring ways to implement blockchain into their systems and products. For example, insurance providers could collect information through blockchains to customize insurance products and reduce instances of fraud.\n\nBlockchains could be used to securely store client health information, uploaded whenever a patient is seen. The blockchain could send requests to insurance through smart contracts, which in turn, could instantly approve or disapprove care and transfer funds.\n\nOther insurance processes could also be streamlined, from finding coverage that meets your needs to filing claims and receiving payments.\n\nBlockchain and Government\n\nSome critical issues regarding government processes and infrastructure are inefficiency, corruption, fraud, waste, lack of trust, security, and siloing. Blockchain has the potential to reduce all of these issues significantly.\n\nGovernment silos are concentrations of information, resources, and decision-making. Critical information that is not shared keeps policy-makers and regulators from making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nResources can be properly tracked, accounted for, and transferred if needed. Data about businesses and citizens can be better secured, and payroll taxes can be collected more efficiently. Additionally, banks could settle intrabank loans in real-time rather than waiting for the end of the day, increasing transaction volume and making banking more efficient.\n\nWhen information is secured and distributed, it cannot be changed or withheld for the benefit of one party or another. Spending can be falsely reported; sometimes, money can disappear without a trace. Using blockchain, government funds can be tracked, and entities can be held accountable for spending.\n\nBlockchain Tech In Healthcare\n\nHealthcare is an industry that can significantly benefit from blockchain. As a secure method of sharing and storing information, blockchain technology cannot directly improve human health, but it can improve the systems used to share medical knowledge and information.\n\nIf blockchain could be integrated into the healthcare system, as some projects are aiming to accomplish, the technology could help improve lives and treatment plans.\n\nBlockchain and the Supply Chain\n\nBlockchain technology can also be used to track the movement of goods. For example, several companies are using distributed ledgers to track perishable goods while keeping track of essential variables like moisture and temperature.\n\nA critical concern in supply chain management is efficiency. Supply chains are vast networks of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Blockchain provides a method to track raw materials, sourcing, production methods, transportation times, payments, and many other supply chain activities that can create inefficiencies or issues.\n\nConcerns About Blockchain Technology\n\nEnthusiasm for blockchain technology is still far from universal. Many enterprises have been using the distributed ledger technology that blockchain evolved from for many years in permissioned environments. The key difference between the two is that blockchain uses programming to reach a consensus about the state of the distributed ledger.\n\nTo come to a consensual agreement about a massive ledger\u0027s state, database researchers and scientists created consensus mechanisms that use encryption methods for proof of transactions on the ledger. One such mechanism is proof-of-work, which requires large amounts of energy because of its competitive rewards nature.\n\nMany blockchains are also slower than centralized systems, with transactions confirmations times between dozens per second to thousands per second. When compared to modern financial systems that confirm tens of thousands of transactions per second, blockchains have been lagging behind—however, many developers are working to increase transactions speeds throughout the networks.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany of the most influential inventions of all time have a broad range of applications. The internet is one of the most recent that has impacted virtually every area of business and personal life since it came into common use in the 1990s. Blockchain, a newcomer, offers as many endless applications as the internet and other inventions proceeding it.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

How do blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs differ?\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are relatively new, while the number of blockchain ETFs is growing. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles and heavily scrutinized by government authorities. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under heightened scrutiny by most regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs primarily track the stock market prices of companies invested in blockchain technology. The first Bitcoin futures ETFs began trading in 2021, and Bitcoin spot ETFs began trading in January 2024.\n\nWhen investing in any ETF, pay attention to the expense ratio, which is what you will pay in fees.

In May 2024, the SEC also approved a rule change that would allow ETFs to hold the ether cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients as well.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs: An Overview\n\nAs Bitcoin earned a stable place within the investment community, Bitcoin and blockchain-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also gained investor interest. The emergence of these ETFs allows access to a broader spectrum of investors wanting exposure to these digital assets without the complications of direct asset management.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—offer a more diversified exposure to the broader blockchain industry across sectors like finance, supply chain management, and healthcare that the technology is changing. Alternatively, Bitcoin ETFs are more focused, providing more direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency.\n\nThese funds either hold Bitcoin directly or track its price through futures contracts, giving investors a way to benefit from Bitcoin\u0027s price appreciation without storing the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nDespite these differences, media reports frequently treat the terms \"Bitcoin\" and \"blockchain\" interchangeably. As a result, it\u0027s possible to confuse blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs, although they are different financial instruments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs primarily track the stock prices of companies that have invested in blockchain technology in their fund, though they aren’t too focused on a specific cryptocurrency or entity. Blockchain is a technology not tied to a particular company or product.\n\n“Bitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn’t need Bitcoin,” said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, which says it’s the largest ETF focused on blockchain. The blockchain universe of investments is not restricted to a particular sector, such as IBM\u0027s blockchain relationships with the auto sector, wineries, and healthcare.\n\nOther firms whose shares are typically held by blockchain ETFs are Visa, which is exploring ways to use blockchain to restructure payment frictions, and Honeywell, a manufacturing company that uses blockchain for supply chain management.\n\nOn the technology front, Nvidia, the graphics processing units giant, provides hardware essential for cryptocurrency mining and blockchain operations and is a blockchain ETF mainstay.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC track the price of Bitcoin through futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In this model, ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin by owning futures contracts.\n\nIn October 2021, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF, tracking Bitcoin futures contracts pegged to the future price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince then, several other funds have launched to expose investors to the Bitcoin market without direct ownership of the currency, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI).\n\nSome funds focus on different crypto-related strategies. ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) allows investors to short Bitcoin, thus profiting from a decline rather than a rise in Bitcoin prices. Other ETFs invest in blockchain companies and Bitcoin futures, such as the Global X Blockchain and Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which blurs the line between these ETFs.\n\nFor many years, U.S. regulators rejected proposals for funds that hold Bitcoins directly, citing worries over the potential for fraud and market manipulation. The regulator also raised these concerns about Tether and other stablecoins.\n\nHowever, the SEC eventually relented in 2023, after a federal appeals court ruled that the regulator had provided insufficient justification for rejecting the ETF applications by the asset manager Grayscale Investments. After the ruling, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs, 11 of them, which began trading in January 2024.\n\nKey Differences\n\nUnderstanding the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain ETFs means knowing the difference between the instruments they track. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while a blockchain is the underlying database technology. This distinction is significant when considered within the context of investment instruments.\n\nEven though Bitcoin futures were already offered on the U.S.’s major exchanges, cryptocurrency’s regulatory status remains unclear in some jurisdictions. As adoption increased, virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles for their role in criminal activities, such as money laundering.\n\nAlternatively, blockchain technology has won the interest of major companies in the world of legacy finance, including JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Visa. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs are also relatively stable compared with the volatility of Bitcoin since they are not exposed to Bitcoin’s price swings.\n\nThat said, blockchain is still considered a nascent technology. As such, the stock prices of companies tracked by the ETF are more susceptible to factors that do not affect blockchain technology. Bitcoin ETFs are also affected by regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are 26 blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs trading in U.S. markets, according to the ETF Database. As of May 24, 2024, these ETFs have a combined worth of just over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM), and their expense ratios range from 0.3% to 2.5%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so have Bitcoin ETFs. In general, digital currencies are mainstream with institutional investors. Many details are appealing about a cryptocurrency ETF—investors would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin more easily and eliminate the inconvenience of securing and storing Bitcoin.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "How blockchain ETFs work and the risks associated with such theme-based investments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies with blockchain technology-related operations or profit from the blockchain. Twenty-five blockchain ETFs trade on U.S. markets as of January 2024. Best known for underpinning cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology\u0027s decentralized structure has potential applications in health care and beyond. Blockchain ETFs are different from cryptocurrency ETFs, which are designed to track the price performance of one or more digital tokens.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nBlockchain exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold stocks of companies that profit from or have business operations tied to blockchain technology. Best known for its use in maintaining decentralized records of cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology has potential applications across many industries, with use cases as diverse as protecting healthcare data and managing video streaming services, among many others.\n\nAs the number of ETFs available on the market has grown, investors can target an increasing variety of market areas and asset types. Blockchain-based ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are one way to invest in a diversified set of companies that may have cryptocurrency on their balance sheet or engage with blockchain technology in other parts of their business.\n\nTwenty-five blockchain ETFs provide U.S. investors with access to companies utilizing the technology as of January 2024.\n\nHow a Blockchain ETF Works\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer an efficient vehicle to invest in a select basket of blockchain-specific stocks. From an investor\u0027s perspective, these funds work just like any other ETF—you gain access to a group of stocks in the blockchain industry in a single instrument that trades on an exchange just like an individual stock.\n\nThe majority of U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs are passively managed, tracking the performance of an underlying index. For example, the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) aims to track the performance of a specially designed index called the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. This index includes companies involved in research, development, support, or utilization of blockchain technology and associated businesses.\n\nThe index methodology assigns a \"Blockchain Score\" to each potential company stock that may be an eligible candidate for inclusion. This score is based on several factors, such as how a company contributes to the blockchain ecosystem, its blockchain product maturity and associated economic impact, investments and expenditures on research and development activities, company results, and innovations.\n\nThe factor-based methodology ensures that the potential of a blockchain company and its business is gauged with higher accuracy for realistic economic profits, renovated business prospects, and operational competence. The 50 to 100 companies with the top Blockchain Scores qualify for entry into this index, and the same stocks get replicated in the BLCN ETF. The index is rebalanced every six months.\n\nSeveral blockchain ETFs opt for an active management strategy rather than relying on a custom-designed index like BLCN. With total assets over $1.1 billion as of January 2024, making it among the largest U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) is one example of an actively managed fund.\n\nBLOK ETF issuer Amplify believes its active strategy allows its fund managers to \"make timely decisions and identify companies that are best positioned to profit from the developing blockchain technology space.\" The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its assets in stocks of companies deriving significant income from transformational data sharing-related business or engaged in the research and development, proof-of-concept testing, or implementation of similar technology.\n\nWhether they use active or passive strategies, blockchain ETFs often invest in companies from the banking and financial sector, technology, IT services, hardware, internet, telecom services, and even biotechnology firms that may be using some form of data sharing or blockchain-based systems.\n\nFor example, BLCN holds stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), and Beyond (BYON). BLOK includes MicroStrategy and Coinbase among its top holdings, along with Japan-based financial services group SBI Holdings (8473.T), Accenture (ACN), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nAs blockchain technology remains open and global, these ETFs include companies from around the globe. Regionally, both BLCN and BLOK have the bulk of exposure to North American-based blockchain companies, while the rest is shared by Asian and European companies in varying proportions.\n\nUse of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency\n\nBeyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is finding use in various other sectors. For one thing, the technology has extended its reach into other areas of the banking and financial markets. Financial institutions are using blockchain for international payments, equity swaps, cross-border trade, regulatory compliance, and protecting customer information.\n\nBut the potential uses of blockchain technology are not limited just to the financial world. The technology has potential in integrating health care data, tracking goods along the supply chain, and helping media companies protect their intellectual property. Even government systems involving voting and identity management could benefit from the blockchain\u0027s enhanced security and transparency.\n\nBlockchain ETF Risks\n\nBeing a theme-based investment, blockchain ETFs carry the inherent risk of non-performance, non-adaptability, or failure of the blockchain ecosystem. While there is an increasing level of acceptance for blockchain systems, the concept remains dependent on the evolution of the overall ecosystem, the reliability and stability of the blockchain network, its configuration, and its successful adoption.\n\nAnother inherent risk is that blockchain ETFs may end up investing in earlier-stage technology-based companies, which are prone to failure. While the diversification through ETFs mitigates such stock-specific risk to a reasonable extent, the risk of specific holdings not performing well remains.\n\nAdditionally, the holdings of blockchain ETFs often overlap with existing technology and internet companies. Companies included in the portfolio may derive a larger share of their revenues from non-blockchain-based products and services.\n\nFor instance, some blockchain ETF holdings might generate most of their revenues from networking equipment and computer processors, with a limited share of hardware used in blockchain-based systems. Blockchain segments may be contributing only a small part of overall revenues to such stocks, making the overall returns vulnerable to the non-performance of their majority non-blockchain segments.\n\nOne also needs to be aware of the expense ratio charged by funds and the trading charges levied by such ETF units. For example, BLCN and BLOK have expense ratios of 0.68% and 0.75%, respectively—significantly higher than a fund like the SPDR S\u0026P 500 ETF (SPY), which charges 0.09%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs invest in a portfolio of companies with business activities related to the blockchain. This distributed database technology underpins cryptocurrency transactions and has many other applications. Some blockchain ETFs seek to track the performance of specialized indexes, while others are actively managed in an attempt to capitalize on the latest technological developments.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network. It is most noteworthy in its use with cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n\nBlockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger. In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\n\nGenerating random hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\n\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\n\nBlockchain can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency and financial system. They would have access to more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do domestic and international business.\n\nIllicit activity accounted for only 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2022.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network\u0027s nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.\n\nBecause there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.\n\nSince Bitcoin\u0027s introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\n\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\n\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\n\nThe blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a block, like a cell in a spreadsheet containing information. Once it is full, the information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash.\n\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in the block. This creates a series of blocks that are chained together.\n\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.\n\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner or validator picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed and encrypted using an encryption algorithm. Then, the mining begins.\n\nThe entire network works simultaneously, trying to \"solve\" the hash. Each one generates a random hash except for the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\n\nEvery miner starts with a nonce of zero, which is appended to their randomly-generated hash. If that number isn\u0027t equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, and a new block hash is generated. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\n\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals about 60 minutes).\n\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin\u0027s process.\n\nBlockchain Decentralization\n\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.\n\nBecause of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s inventory.\n\nBlockchain Transparency\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.\n\nFor example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted are easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.\n\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\n\nIs Blockchain Secure?\n\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.\n\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block\u0027s hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would reject an altered block because the hashes would not match.\n\nFor instance, imagine that a hacker runs a node on a blockchain network and wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to change their copy, they would have to convince the other nodes that their copy was the valid one.\n\nThey would need to control a majority of the network to do this and insert it at just the right moment. This is known as a 51% attack because you need to control more than 50% of the network to attempt it.\n\nTiming would be everything in this type of attack—by the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast—the Bitcoin network hashed at 348.1 exahashes per second (18 zeros) on April 21, 2023.\n\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”The key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.\n\nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.\n\nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.\n\nThe nature of blockchain’s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country\u0027s citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.\n\nEach candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to vote. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.\n\nBlockchain vs. Banks\n\nBlockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.\n\nTo see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.\n\nHow Are Blockchains Used?\n\nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, more than 23,000 other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.\n\nSome companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.\n\nWhy do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.\n\nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.\n\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.\n\nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\n\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\n\n",

    "summary": "Here are reviews of five of the best available books on blockchain, a relatively new, but rapidly growing and very important technology.\n\n\"Cryptoassets\" offers investors an introduction to blockchain, including basic concepts, a valuation framework, and practical details on getting started. \"Blockchain Revolution\" examines how blockchain technology might transform the ways we live and trade in the future. \"The Book of Satoshi\" helps readers to understand the blockchain from the perspective of its creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. \"The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains\" provides a comprehensive overview of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, serving as an excellent introduction for people new to the industry. \"The Blockchain Developer\" is a powerful resource for those interested in exploring the technical aspects of blockchain work to start new or continue existing projects.\n\nLike any new technology, understanding the financial implications of blockchain is often more useful to investors than learning technical details.\n\n",
    "content": "Innovative blockchain technology works without the need for a central authority. Blockchain is the underlying technological foundation of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dozens of leading financial firms, including Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM), are investing heavily in developing the technology. For people who want to learn more about blockchain technology and its applications, here are three of the best books on the subject.\n\n\u0027Cryptoassets\u0027 by Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar\n\nBurniske and Tatar look at blockchain from a financial perspective, but they also cover key technological concepts along the way. \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor\u0027s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond\" is written for investors rather than programmers or Bitcoin enthusiasts. That keeps most of their explanations relevant and comprehensible. Burniske and Tatar start with the origins of Bitcoin during the 2008 financial crisis and cover the basics. They also explain the crucial differences between Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology. The book then details the types of cryptoassets that have arisen, such as crypto tokens and crypto commodities.\n\nThis book also goes far beyond most of the literature by attempting to define cryptoassets as an asset class. There is even a chapter that takes on the difficult task of developing a valuation framework for cryptoassets. While the market is still too young for any framework to be definitive, Burniske and Tatar deserve praise for laying the necessary foundations. Finally, they also deal with the practical details of blockchain investing. Blockchain wallets, cryptocurrency exchanges, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are all covered.\n\n\u0027Blockchain Revolution\u0027 by Don and Alex Tapscott\n\nThe father-son team of Don and Alex Tapscott has written \"Blockchain Revolution\" to explain the impact of cryptocurrencies. The fully open platform of blockchain technology will expand and transform what we can do online, how we do it, and who can participate. According to the Tapscotts, blockchain technology will immensely improve the delivery of expanding financial services and the safeguarding of personal identity information. Blockchain also has benefits for business contracts and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe book also discusses the various ways that blockchain technology is changing the future of money, transactions, and business. Don Tapscott, also the author of \"Wikinomics,\" and his son, Alex, an expert on the blockchain, carefully explain the technology. They see it as a simple but transformative protocol that enables financial transactions to be both anonymous and secure through the distributed ledger. The authors recognize that blockchain technology is still in its infancy. They do an excellent job of separating what the technology can actually deliver now from its vast potential for the future.\n\n\u0027The Book of Satoshi\u0027 by Phil Champagne\n\nBlockchain technology and Bitcoin are linked because blockchain makes cryptocurrencies possible. This book offers the writings of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. As of early 2024, the general public still did not know the true identity of Nakamoto.\n\nThe Nakamoto persona has only a virtual existence, much like its cryptocurrency creation. The persona is present only in the online publications Nakamoto offered to explain Bitcoin during the earliest days of its introduction. The Book of Satoshi is a definitive collection of Nakamoto\u0027s essential writings, including the original paper detailing the idea of Bitcoin. The book also contains Nakamoto\u0027s explanation of how Bitcoin works and a chronologically organized collection of Nakamoto\u0027s emails and online forum posts.\n\n\u0027The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains\u0027 by Antony Lewis\n\nAntony Lewis, formerly of early cryptocurrency exchange itBit, has been an expert in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces for nearly a decade. In this book, Lewis clearly and concisely breaks down the technical aspects of blockchain technology in a way that is digestible and understandable for those within and outside of the space. While this book also covers the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies as well, it is also a useful guide for those particularly interested in blockchain technology and its many applications.\n\n\u0027The Blockchain Developer\u0027 by Elad Elrom\n\nWhile other books on this list provide a general overview of blockchain technology, this book is written with developers in mind. As such, The Blockchain Developer does not shy away from technical discussion and granular, detailed information. After introducing the technology and its structure, author Elad Elrom discusses the process of creating your own blockchain, building dApps, and more. There are specialized sections of the book relating to popular existing blockchains for developers interested in creating apps for preexisting networks, as well as a portion of the book about blockchain applications outside of cryptocurrency.\n\n",

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia arranged the blockchain bond issue, which initially raised A$110 million and a subsequent A$50 million during a second tranche offering. Financial institutions are beginning to look to the power of blockchain technology for the management, creation, and oversight of various debt instruments. A benefit of blockchain-based bonds is the ability to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies.\n\nThe World Bank raises on average between $55 billion and $65 billion each year by issuing bonds.\n\n",
    "content": "Some of the most important and influential financial institutions worldwide may be looking to further integrate blockchain technology into their offerings, including the creation of blockchain-based bonds. For an example of how to accomplish this, they might look to one of the world\u0027s largest lenders to developing countries, the World Bank.\n\nIn August 2018, the World Bank launched its bond-i, short for \"blockchain operated new debt instrument.\" The new bond was created through Australia\u0027s Commonwealth Bank (CBA). Below, we\u0027ll discuss how blockchain-based bonds work and take a look at how these bonds could impact the mainstream investment world.\n\nBond-i Details\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the bond-i is the world\u0027s first bond to be \"created, allocated, transferred, and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology.\" The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the arranger for the bond issue, which raised A$110 million. The maturity date for the two-year bond was Aug. 28, 2020. Coupon payments were paid semi-annually in arrears at an annual rate of 2.2%.\n\nThe bond-i was the culmination of research performed by the World Bank\u0027s Blockchain Innovation Lab. Launched in June 2017, the lab\u0027s research is part of the World Bank\u0027s strategy to study the impact of disruptive technologies (such as blockchain) on global economies and harness its potential for development. The CBA Blockchain Centre of Excellence developed and built the bond-i blockchain platform.\n\nIn May 2019, the World Bank and CBA announced they had successfully added to their platform\u0027s capability by enabling secondary bond trading recorded on blockchain. The goal was to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies. In August 2019, the World Bank reported it had issued a second tranche of its blockchain bond, raising an additional A$50 million.\n\nIt\u0027s important to note that while bond-i is the first bond issued through blockchain, it is not the only debt instrument to do so. The Spanish banking group BBVA signed a €150 million blockchain-based loan in November 2018.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Is Integral\n\nA private Ethereum blockchain is set up to allow for the management of blockchain bonds. This blockchain network also creates bond-i products. According to the World Bank, the platform has been reviewed by Microsoft to ensure that architecture, security, and functionality are solid. The CBA development team partnered with a law firm to plan for the issuance of bonds and to develop the smart contracts which govern bond-i products.\n\nIndependent blockchain developer Matthew Di Ferrante, who has previously worked for the Ethereum Foundation, indicated that the move is a \"good first example\" of how blockchain can be integrated into the bond world. He adds that \"financial instruments like bonds are easily ported to blockchains/smart contracts, but it\u0027s not the be-all and end-all even for mainstream financial institutions. The real usefulness will come when many different institutions and industries are all using compatible blockchains\" (emphasis in original).\n\nImplications of the Project\n\nWhile the bonds issued as part of this project may be fairly standard, the implications of the project are not. First, there is the question of decentralization. For much of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, decentralization is a crucial and central tenet. Necessarily, a private blockchain with the World Bank co-managing is not nearly as decentralized as many blockchain projects are.\n\nFurther, while this bond project harnessed blockchain technology for management, creation, and oversight, it was essentially entirely unrelated to cryptocurrency. Some might see this as a confirmation that mainstream financial institutions are happy to separate out cryptocurrencies from blockchain technology, preferring to only utilize the latter as they ignore the former.\n\nWhile the World Bank\u0027s bondi-i was not the first time that major financial institutions have looked toward blockchain technology in various ways, it does have the potential to influence other institutions which may have previously been hesitant. Undoubtedly, the perceived success or failure of the bond-i program will impact other financial institutions\u0027 decision to explore this space as well.\n\n",

In order to function as an OS, blockchain protocols must allow for the execution of computer code and commands from users. Initially aimed as OS for mobile phones or other connected smart devices, blockchain operating systems tout a high level of data security and user anonymity.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain Operating System?\n\nA blockchain operating system uses blockchain as a support system that runs in the background of a computer system or platform. For instance, your Android mobile or Windows PC needs a local installation of the respective operating system (OS) on the smartphone’s memory or on the PC’s hard disk, and all transactions and commands are executed locally. A blockchain-based OS captures all commands and transactions from a user’s device where authenticating, executing, and recording them occurs on the blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Operating Systems\n\nBeyond the standard payment processing system of the popular Bitcoin cryptocurrency, blockchain is finding extensive use all across the technology stack. The emerging fad among the technical development on distributed ledger technology is the blockchain operating system.\n\nA blockchain essentially works as a ledger turned transaction processing engine. Whether you need a payment processed, or you need to arm your cryptokitty with the latest gadget on the Ethereum platform, or if you want to track your high-cost wine shipment right from the vineyard to your doorstep on the VeChain blockchain, all such applications of blockchain are based on authenticating, recording, and processing transactions.\n\nAny standard operating system, be it Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or mobile systems like Android or iOS, also executes transactions based on user commands issued through mouse-clicks or screen-taps where all the tasks get completed locally on the device. The same concept is extended to the use of a blockchain for device OS, where its use for working as an operating system is seen as a more efficient OS.\n\nExamples of Blockhain OS Efforts\n\nEarly attempts to build blockchain-based OS first emerged for mobile and smartphone use, and it was a cloud-based virtual system. All the necessary transaction processing occurs on the cloud-hosted blockchain-based data center, with the user only issuing necessary commands through the taps on the device touchscreen.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong-based NYNJA Group Ltd. has a strategic collaboration with Amgoo smartphone makers for its blockchain-based NYNJA virtual operating system (vOS). The two companies will work with telecom operators in Latin America to provide NYNJA vOS users with an initial block of data upon activation. The vOS supports a communication layer offering text, voice, video conferencing, and project management tools, a secure payments layer for commercial transactions, and a multi-currency wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all ERC-20 compatible tokens.\n\nThe OS platform also supports a marketplace for commercial activities—like allocating the skilled ‘gig economy workers to specific job demands from the users, and a market for users to buy and sell goods. The vOS is supported by its native cryptocurrency called NYNJAcoin or NYN.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nAll benefits and advantages of blockchain are expected to be available to blockchain OS users.\n\nWhatever a user does on their Android or iOS mobiles, or Windows or Mac PCs is prone to be captured by the respective apps, ISPs, as well as OS manufacturers who may record all user activities in the OS logs. Blockchain-based OS offers benefits of security and privacy, and the de-regulated, decentralized use of OS.\n\nThe concept is still evolving, and real-world use is limited. However, if it succeeds in offering a smooth and clutter-free working of the device OS, it may not be too far to see more and more devices running on such blockchain OS.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that enables users to manage the cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether.\n\nBroadly speaking, a blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and trade their cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet is also the name of a specific wallet service provided by the company Blockchain. This is an E-wallet that allows individuals to store and transfer cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet users can manage their balances of Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto assets. Blockchain Wallet charges dynamic fees, meaning that the transaction fees can be different based on factors such as transaction size. Blockchain Wallet has a number of security features to prevent theft, including by company insiders.\n\n",
    "content": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet can also refer to the wallet service provided by Blockchain, a software company founded by Peter Smith and Nicolas Cary. A blockchain wallet allows transfers in cryptocurrencies and the ability to convert them back into a user\u0027s local currency.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Wallet\n\nE-wallets allow individuals to store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. In the case of Blockchain Wallet, users can manage their balances of various cryptocurrencies such as the well-known Bitcoin and Ether as well as stellar, Tether, and Paxos Standard.\n\nCreating an e-wallet with Blockchain Wallet is free, and the account setup process is done online. Individuals must provide an email address and password that will be used to manage the account, and the system will send an automated email requesting that the account be verified.\n\nOnce the wallet is created, the user is provided with a Wallet ID, which is a unique identifier similar to a bank account number. Wallet holders can access their e-wallet by logging into the Blockchain website, or by downloading and accessing a mobile application.\n\nThe Blockchain Wallet interface shows the current wallet balance for crypto-assets and the user’s most recent transactions. Users can also access the price charts and see the value of the funds in the chosen local currency of the user. There is also an educational Did You Know section sharing crypto facts and news.\n\nHow a Blockchain Wallet Works\n\nUsers can send a request to another party for a specific amount of bitcoin or other crypto-assets, and the system generates a unique address that can be sent to a third party or converted into a Quick Response code or QR code for short. A QR code is similar to a barcode, which stores financial information and can be read by a digital device.\n\nA unique address is generated each time the user makes a request. Users can also send crypto-assets when someone provides them with a unique address. The send-and-receive process is similar to sending or receiving funds through PayPal but uses cryptocurrency instead. PayPal is an online payment provider that acts as a go-between for customers and their banks and credit cards by facilitating online transfers through financial institutions.\n\nUsers can also exchange Bitcoin for other crypto-assets and visa-versa, known as swapping. This practice is an easy way to switch out crypto without leaving the security of the Blockchain Wallet. Users are shown a quote indicating how much they will receive based on the current exchange rate, with the rate changing depending on how long the user takes to complete the transaction. Swaps should take a couple of hours while the transactions are added to each currency’s blockchain. However, if it takes longer than six hours, users should contact customer support.\n\nBlockchain Wallet only allows six crypto-assets for swapping: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, Tether, USD Digital, Wrapped-DGLD.\n\nUsers can also buy or sell crypto through the Buy Crypto interface available to Blockchain Wallet. Buy and sell services are not available in all locations. To make a purchase, a user can either transfer funds from a bank, use a credit or debit card, or use the available cash balance. There is a daily limit of $25,000 and a weekly limit of $100,000 as well as a minimum buy order of $5 and a maximum buy order of $25,000.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Fees\n\nHowever, it\u0027s important to note that the Blockchain Wallet uses a process they call dynamic fees, meaning that the fee charged per transaction can be different based on various factors. Both the transaction size and the conditions of the network at the time of the transaction can greatly impact the size of the fee. Only so many transactions can be processed within a block by the high-powered computers called miners. The miners typically process the transactions that have the highest fees first since it\u0027s financially advantageous to them.\n\nBlockchain Wallet offers a priority fee, which could possibly get the transaction processed within an hour. There\u0027s also a regular fee, which is cheaper but the transaction would likely take more than an hour. Fees can also be customized by the customer. However, if the customer sets the fee too low, the transfer or transaction could be delayed or rejected.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Security\n\nWallet security is an important consideration for users, as a compromised account may result in users losing control of their assets. Blockchain Wallet has several levels of security to protect user funds from any possible attacker, including the company itself.\n\nLike other digital services, Blockchain Wallet accounts require passwords for the users\u0027 protection. However, the Blockchain company does not store user passwords, and cannot reset the password if lost. This measure prevents company insiders from being able to steal cryptocurrencies. If a user forgets or loses their password, the account can only be recovered with a mnemonic seed.\n\nA mnemonic seed is a random string of English words that function similarly to a password. If a user loses access to their phone or device, the seed can be used to restore the wallet, including any cryptocurrencies. Like passwords, the Blockchain company does not store users\u0027 mnemonic seeds. These seeds follow an industry standard, meaning the wallets can be recovered even if the company goes out of business.\n\nIn addition to the protections outlined above, there are also several optional security measures that are not required but can help secure user wallets against outside attacks. To reduce the danger of phishing, the Blockchain Wallet allows users to use two-factor authentication or IP whitelists to prevent log-ins from unfamiliar devices. It is also possible to block access through the Tor network, thereby preventing prospective hackers from disguising their IP addresses.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. One of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology provides a platform for creating a highly secure, decentralized, anonymized, yet auditable chain of record, used presently in cryptocurrency systems. This same technology could also be used to record and report votes and prevent many types of voter fraud in elections. Especially after the misinformation surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, the world may be ready for blockchain voting on larger scales.\n\n",
    "content": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. Although the Internet has long been familiar with other peer-to-peer applications for file sharing, music streaming, and more, the idea that these types of networks can provide their own security and resources has only been around since 2008. In the decade since its inception, blockchain was mostly tied to the success of the technology that created it, bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, however, it has quickly become a star on its own. With the rise of the world’s favorite cryptocurrency, awareness of the mysterious and unique technology behind it also grew. Developers who recognized the value of blockchain are now racing to create new use cases for it and put their ideas into production.\n\nMany are finding that blockchain’s primary value lies in its ability to improve old systems. Enterprising observers saw the technology’s potential from the start, as bitcoin offered a more secure and transparent payment processing and banking solution than existing ones. In recent years, the same people have used blockchain to revolutionize industries far and wide, including cloud storage, smart contracts, crowdfunding, and even healthcare. However, one of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain Serves the Voters\n\nIn its most basic form, blockchain is a digital ledger. The technology draws its power from the peers—or nodes—on its network to verify, process, and record all transactions across the system. This ledger is never stored, but rather exists on the “chain” supported by millions of nodes simultaneously. Thanks to encryption and decentralization, blockchain’s database of transactions is incorruptible, and each record is easily verifiable. The network cannot be taken down or influenced by a single party because it doesn’t exist in one place.\n\nIt’s not only financial transactions that work with blockchain, but any type of data transmission. This kind of system infrastructure is extremely useful for voting because a vote is a small piece of high-value data. Out of necessity, modern voting systems are largely stuck in the last century, and those that want to vote must leave their homes and submit paper ballots to a local authority. Why not bring this process online? Some have tried, but it has proven difficult to put faith in the results due to large gaps in security.\n\nBlockchain can solve the many problems discovered in these early attempts at online voting. A blockchain-based voting application does not concern itself with the security of its Internet connection, because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to affect other nodes. Voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible.\n\nBringing Elections into the 21st Century\n\nThere are already companies working to bring blockchain to the voting populace. One such firm is Horizon State, which has launched a unique solution to answer the question, “If democracy was designed with today’s technology, what would it look like?” The company believes its first product is the answer. The company is currently preparing an ICO, planned for October.\n\nHorizon\u0027s secure digital ballot box represents a cost-effective and smart solution to the problems inherent in today’s voting procedures. Participants will use decision tokens (HST) to cast their votes from a mobile phone or PC, which are then logged into an immutable blockchain and used to reliably verify the outcome of the election. There can be no manipulation, recording errors, or tampering. More than voting, however, this system will be useful simply for making decisions in an environment where resources and authority are shared. It will also encourage participation.\n\nVoter apathy has seen the number of people show up to cast their votes dwindle in recent years, even as it has become more important to do so. By providing an irrefutable and easy way to vote from one’s phone or PC, these numbers would likely rise. Even governments have a reason to change the status quo: a single vote currently costs between $7.00 and $25.00, when all factors are considered. A blockchain product like this costs just $0.50 per vote.\n\nHorizon State co-founder Jamie Skella noted that “Democracy is the opportunity to share in the decision-making processes that relate to the shared matters which affect us. Democracy is about reaching a consensus on how to best use our shared resources to achieve the best outcomes for our partners, children, colleagues, staff, and fellow citizens. Where there are shared resources in any cooperative environment, there remains no question: we need better-shared decision-making tools and processes.”Blockchain-based elections are being trialed in the real world. In November 2018, the Thai Democrat Party, Thailand’s oldest political party, held a primary election to elect its new party leader using ZCoin, marking the first large-scale political election carried out using blockchain technology. The vote was concluded with a total of 127,479 votes that came from all over Thailand.﻿﻿﻿A True Democracy\n\nBlockchain is paving the way for a direct democracy, where people can decide the course of policy themselves, rather than rely on representatives to do it for them. While the rules of a political election may have to be changed to make way for such a transparent system, blockchain is also ideal for informing business decisions, guiding general meetings, polling, censuses, and more.\n\nThe use cases for blockchain voting software are many and diverse. Its ability to engage and manage a constituency is crucial to the future of society, not just to produce a transparent outcome but to encourage all people to participate in their communities. Currently, the technology is still in its infancy, but it matures alongside the young voters it will one day help, and looks to be a key part of our collective future.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "All hype aside, blockchain technology is really good at one thing: taking out the middlemen. Leaky data brokers\u0027 days may be numbered.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technology has been dragged through the muck in recent months by scammers, charlatans and comedians. A joke cryptocurrency attracted piles of real cash, a kleptocratic regime announced an ICO, and an ice tea company pivoted to bitcoin mining. (For about a minute.) In the wake of all this hype, plunging cryptocurrency prices have hardly helped matters. It\u0027s time for a reminder that, while no panacea, blockchain technology is extremely good at doing one, quite useful thing: removing intermediaries.\n\nTake bitcoin, the original token on the original blockchain, which gave people an unprecedented third option for transferring money. Prior to bitcoin\u0027s invention, one of two things was possible: handing money over in person, or trusting a middleman such as a bank to do it on your behalf. With bitcoin, you can transfer money remotely without a middleman. This is a first in human history.\n\nThe economy harbors plenty of middlemen besides banks, but projects based on bitcoin\u0027s core innovation, the blockchain, have the potential to challenge them as well. Take data brokers. These are mostly obscure, with meaningless, x-heavy names like Acxiom, DataLogix, Experian, Ameridex, and the now-famous Equifax. These firms scrape consumer data – financial transfers, social media activity, browsing history, e-commerce purchases, location data – from public sources, or buy it from digital services. (Here\u0027s everywhere PayPal customers\u0027 data ends up, for example.)The brokers analyze this data to determine everything from hobbies to credit worthiness to addictions to sexual orientation. They sell it on to advertisers, card issuers, prospective employers and whoever else might be interested. In this way, each individual consumer generates a nice stream of rent for an industry that gives them nothing in return. Equifax Inc. (EFX) earned $488.8 million in profit in 2016, $3.36 for each of the 145.5 million victims of the data breach it announced in September.\n\nAccounting for the number of players in the industry and the rapid growth in the amount of data users produce, Datawallet – more on them in a bit – estimates that in the year 2022, roughly $7,600 worth of personal information will be bought and sold per person, a quantity the firm\u0027s founder and CEO Serafin Lion Engel likens to a universal basic income.\n\nIt can only serve that purpose, though, if the money does not go to middlemen, but to the people who actually generate the value. That\u0027s hardly the case today. User data, often called the \"new oil,\" more closely resembles the new guano. These nitrogen-rich seabird feces were the most sought-after fertilizer in the world for most of the 19th century. Like data, guano was procured through extraction, rather than transaction. And as with data, the seabirds that produced the stuff were never compensated.\n\nUsers of digital services are treated a bit like oblivious gulls who happen to excrete an immensely productive resource, rather than owners of an asset they create. Blockchain technology and related cryptographic techniques could change that, giving us control over our personal data and enabling us to sell it to whomever we please.\n\n\"You have the monopoly\"\n\nDatawallet is one of the companies trying to bring this change about. The app has mostly gained media attention as a way to earn $5 or $10 a month selling Facebook likes, Amazon purchases, Uber rides and Airbnb trips. Engel expects early adopters to be college students \"who are in it for beer money.\"But the idea behind Datawallet holds a more fundamental appeal, the ability to control what Engel calls a \"self-sovereign wallet,\" which makes the user the sole owner of their data and the only one with the ability to grant access to it. Engel says, \"you have the monopoly over that data about you.\"Datawallet is just one among a slew of blockchain-based apps aiming to do away with data middlemen wherever they can be found.\n\nMedicalchain is tackling medical records, giving patients full control over some of their most sensitive information and bypassing the healthcare system\u0027s decrepit infrastructure (think fax machines) in the process. Loomia is going after smart textiles, an industry in which other players are eager to harvest and hoard heart rates, geographical movements and even more intimate metrics (think smart mattresses).\n\nMost of these projects are in their very early stages, but if they come to fruition, something unprecedented and rather strange may emerge: empty platforms, places that facilitate commerce in data, but where no one party is doing the facilitating. Henri Pihkala, founder and CEO of Streamr, a blockchain-based platform for live data streams, captures the paradox: \"we make a central place which is decentralized.\"The tech: Keys, hashes, smart contracts\n\nHow does that work? The details vary, but Datawallet\u0027s solution is generally representative of the technology that enables these decentralized platforms.\n\nKeysSay you want to sell some of your personal data – for example, your Facebook activity or Amazon purchases – using Datawallet. You and the purchaser each have a public key and a private key. Public keys are used to encrypt a message, to scramble it so that it looks like gibberish to everyone except the holder of the matching private key, who can use it to decrypt (unscramble) the message.\n\nIn order to exchange your private data securely, you encrypt it with the purchaser\u0027s public key and send the encrypted data to them. They take the data and decrypt it with their private key. If someone in the middle intercepts the data, all they obtain is an unreadable mess.\n\nHashesIn Datawallet\u0027s design, the data exchange itself happens off-chain, since the contents are both too large and too sensitive to broadcast to the central ledger (for Datawallet and most other projects, this ledger is the ethereum blockchain). What does go on the blockchain are hashes of the data. You hash the data you\u0027re selling and post the result to the chain, and the buyer hashes the data they receive and posts that result to the chain. If the hashes match, a payment held in escrow is released. (See also, Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Driven by Different Purposes.)What are hashes and what do they accomplish? They are cryptographic functions that enable quick verification that two sets of data are identical.\n\nThey do this by distilling data down to a manageable chunk. No matter how short or long the text you run through SHA256, the hash function used by bitcoin, you will get 64 characters back. Here\u0027s the hash of the first scene of Hamlet, for example:Now if you have the text of Hamlet, you can instantly check that what you\u0027ve received has not been tampered with – no need to pore over every jot and tittle. Simply hash your text and compare it to the hash of the sender\u0027s ostensibly identical text. (This works just as well for web browser data or Amazon purchase histories.)The process is instant because hash functions are so finicky. Delete the exclamation point in the scene\u0027s first line, and that one change yields an unrecognizably different hash:This sensitivity to tampering makes hashing central to bitcoin, ethereum and their peers. Thousands of identical copies of a blockchain can be efficiently maintained because they\u0027re compared using hashes, rather than through meticulous scans of every block. (See also, How Bitcoin Works.)Hashes are also useful because data cannot be unhashed. No one using any known technology can take 91BBAB0… and wring Shakespeare back out of it. That makes it relatively safe to broadcast a hash of sensitive information to the blockchain, as Datawallet does.\n\nBlockchain and smart contractsEven though the data exchange itself does not happen on-chain, the ledger is crucial to decentralized data transfer. Blockchains are immutable public records that remove all doubt about what was traded, at what price, and when. The hashes broadcast to the blockchain either match or they don\u0027t, so buyers can\u0027t claim they didn\u0027t receive data that in fact they did. Nor does anybody need to wonder whether a hacker or spy tampered with the data en route.\n\nWithout the need for someone to mediate the exchange, brokers lose their raison d\u0027être. They are replaced by a large number of (ideally) dispersed, competing and mutually distrustful \"miners\" who post exchanges to the ledger. (See also, How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)Miners also obviate the need for a bank: blockchain technology\u0027s main application has always been as a distributed money transfer platform. Finally, ethereum offers the ability to enforce complex contracts via this same distributed network of miners. You may have paused at the reference to a \"payment held in escrow\" above. Who\u0027s holding the money while it straddles buyer and seller?No one, it turns out. Ethereum took bitcoin\u0027s decentralized money and made it programmable via smart contracts: self-executing bits of code that live on the blockchain. If all the hashes match and all other pre-agreed conditions are met, the money automatically moves from the buyer\u0027s account to the seller\u0027s. No need for a trusted custodian in the middle.\n\nBlockchain has problems aplenty\n\nAs promising as this technology sounds, not all the kinks have been worked out. Some may never be. Start with scalability.\n\nExpensive and slowBlockchains are fat, lumbering beasts. Distributed consensus is slow and costly compared to the centralized networks that are currently in operation, so how can blockchain technology compete in a user data market that – for all its shadiness – at least works at scale?Datawallet sidesteps the problem by transferring data off-chain. On-chain transfers of data troves that might include videos and other large files \"would immediately crash the ethereum blockchain,\" says Engel. And in any case, no one would want that kind of data broadcast to a public ledger.\n\nMedicalchain leaves health records where they are, on regulatory-compliant servers in the patient\u0027s home jurisdiction. It simply provides a platform for patients to grant doctors access to their records. (See also, Blockchain Technology Could Revolutionize Health Care.)Some projects are trying to scale by tweaking the way distributed networks are structured. Streamr combines a \"reputation mechanism\" called karma with its blockchain-based token, DATAcoin, to divvy up the work. \"We need to assign asymmetric responsibilities to different nodes,\" says Pihkala, \"otherwise we end up with a situation that is typical with current-day blockchains, which is all the data goes to all the nodes, leading to no scalability.\" The nodes put down a DATAcoin stake, which they lose if they break the rules. Karma, meanwhile, assigns greater responsibility to the most reliable nodes, increasing efficiency without sacrificing too much in the way of decentralization.\n\nKochava is taking similar ideas and applying them to a blockchain it is building in-house to reduce opacity and fraud in digital advertising. XCHNG, as the platform is called, uses a reputation mechanism and a brutal form of pruning – in which most nodes only hold onto a day\u0027s worth of ledger history – to process the huge volume of transactions digital ad delivery demands. Kochava founder and CEO Charles Manning believes the platform could deliver millions of transactions per second. Ethereum can manage around 15 or so, bitcoin far fewer. (See also, What\u0027s the Bitcoin Scalability Debate?)Where do you store it?Every blockchain application faces problems with storage. Monetary transactions and smart contracts might be utterly decentralized, but the data itself either resides in centralized servers, à la Medicalchain (this is largely for regulatory reasons, to be fair), or on users\u0027 own storage-constrained devices, à la Datawallet.\n\nA number of projects are trying to enable decentralized storage, including IPFS, BigchainDB and Storj. Engel, Pihkala, and Janett Liriano, the CEO of Loomia, each mention plans to integrate their platforms with one or the other of these companies.\n\nYou still give up your dataAt some point, the quest to establish ownership over your personal data hits a wall. You can encrypt it. You can transfer it directly, shunning intermediaries and keeping it encrypted en route. You can ensure that the buyer pays the agreed amount upon receipt.\n\nBut no technological legerdemain can overcome the fact that once the buyer has your data, as Guy Zyskind (co-founder and CEO of Enigma) puts it, \"You\u0027re done. They can take your data, they can copy it, they can go off-chain and then that\u0027s it.\" Rogue employees, incompetent defenses against hacking, reselling – the unpleasant possibilities abound.\n\nYet rather incredibly, Zyskind says you can make your data available to use without actually revealing it. Through a technique called secure multiparty computation, his company is building a platform that enables data not only to be stored in an encrypted, distributed form, but to be computed over while still in that encrypted, distributed form.\n\nWith an IPFS, a Storj or a BigchainDB, it\u0027s possible to keep your data secure and to decentralize it across multiple devices. But if you want to do anything with that data – run it through an algorithm or edit it – you have to decrypt and re-centralize it. In order for a credit rating agency to calculate your creditworthiness, say, they need full access and visibility.\n\n",

    "summary": "The emergence of cryptocurrencies has spawned new investment potential. Some of these might be odd, but where there is value, there is opportunity.\n\nMany established tech companies are investing heavily in blockchain and distributed ledger technology applications. Cryptocurrencies are part of blockchain technology designed for transferring value; investors are also using them to store value, hedge other investments, and hold them for growth. Non-fungible tokens are part of the emerging metaverse design as ownership of digital assets becomes popular. Digital securities use blockchain to create traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Web 3 is a concept of internet privacy and ownership being developed using blockchain technology.\n\nParamount among the benefits of DLT is its ability to reduce the costs of maintaining, securing, and verifying databases on a global scale.\n\nNew blockchain uses are constantly emerging as more companies research ways to incorporate it into their industries and internal procedures.\n\nDigital securities trading may not be regulated or available where you live, so ensure you check with your country\u0027s authorities before attempting it.\n\n",
    "content": "Distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain have made their way into business, finance, and many other industries. Their introduction to the mainstream following the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies has created new investment vehicles, opportunities, and new sectors. Additionally, new business models using these advancements are emerging that improve workflows, data security, e-commerce, government processes, and much more.\n\nA distributed ledger is a network of stored files in which every transaction is recorded. Blockchain was developed from the distributed ledger concept, but it enhances public use and security. Programs are used to confirm, validate, and archive information, and they can be accessed in near real-time by all participants.\n\nIn general, there are four broad areas for you to consider investing in: cryptocurrency itself, investment instruments linked to or holding cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens, and businesses developing and implementing new products that use blockchain or distributed ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology is similar to distributed ledger technology (DLT) but is specific to cryptocurrency and the ecosystems that have evolved from it. It uses encryption and verification methods to restrict access to append-only, where new data can be entered, but existing data can not be changed.\n\nBlockchain use cases have exploded, with the technology making its way into everything from tokenizing pixel art to fantasy football leagues to digital worlds where you can buy virtual real estate.\n\nUnderstanding Distributed Ledger Technology\n\nDLT is used across enterprises to synchronize and share data in a ledger while verifying the accuracy of inputs and outputs. The span of industries using DLT continues to grow, encompassing supply chains, accounting, financial services, warehousing, shipping, and more.\n\nThe good news is that opportunities for investing in blockchain and DLT are abundant, giving you a chance to leverage the potential offered. How you choose to invest in blockchain technology will largely depend on the amount of risk you\u0027re willing to incur and what interests you.\n\nCompanies Developing Blockchain Uses\n\nYou can invest in several companies that are researching and developing blockchain and DLT products and services. Many well-known companies are developing blockchains for business, and many more are creating them for in-house use. There are several markets you can choose from:Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the concept of removing financial institutions from their role as third parties in transactions. The idea is to allow people to take control of their finances with digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, and other financial services.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency is part of DeFi, it is only the tip of the iceberg. DeFi is the all-inclusive term for all things financial that are not part of any traditional, centralized method of controlling money. Cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency exchanges, lenders, borrowers, and even insurance are part of this growing sector.\n\nFinancial technology (Fintech) is the development and use of technology to improve existing financial services. The developments in blockchain technology are revolutionizing traditional services like lending, money transfers, and banking. Paypal is one of the most well-known examples of a fintech company—there are many more you can choose from to diversify your portfolio.\n\nThe metaverse is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp that is expected to use blockchain. The metaverse is an emerging digital and ever-present world where virtual reality, augmented reality, and reality meet. The concept is to develop an immersive digital experience where a person can learn, work, play, and socialize.\n\nSocial media platforms, game developers, and technology companies are developing the hardware and software needed for this digital life experience. Meta (formerly Facebook), Advanced Microdevices (AMD), Nvidia, Amazon, and Epic Games are examples of companies that have expressed interest in metaverse products and services. Blockchain will play a large part in the metaverse as it develops.\n\nWeb 3 companies are developing solutions that are reportedly set to change how the Internet works in the background. Blockchain technology is being used to create an infrastructure designed to restore privacy, ownership, and control to the masses.\n\nHere are some of the emerging theories on how Web 3 will benefit everyone using blockchain technology:You can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies by setting up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. Price movements create opportunities for profits through day trading or buying and selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese exchanges are also businesses—Coinbase (COIN) is a publicly traded company with stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange that can expose you to blockchain without requiring you to invest directly in cryptocurrency.\n\nDigital Securities\n\nBlockchain has enabled the decentralization and tokenization of nearly anything that has value. For example, a company that wants to raise money can create digital investment instruments using a blockchain, similar to how non-fungible tokens are created. Tokenization, in this respect, is the transfer of ownership or interest to a token, which is the digital representation of that ownership linked to the blockchain.\n\nDigital securities use smart contracts—programs that execute exchanges or trades as soon as both parties agree to it. This creates a safety net for traders and investors who want to buy or sell securities directly with another party rather than through a transaction facilitator like a broker.\n\nThe digital securities market continues to evolve, but you can find them emerging in sectors such as:The main benefit of digital securities is that they can be fractionalized to a much greater degree than is practical with traditional securities. In addition, this fractionalization offers exposure to markets that you may not have previously been able to access due to the amount of capital needed to gain entry.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are tokenized. They existed before 2021, but media attention that year popularized them in the mainstream after the digital artist Beeple sold a collage of non-fungible tokens for $69 million. An NFT can be any digital asset—clothing, art, music, movies, video games, or anything else that can be tokenized.\n\nEmerging and Future Developments\n\nFollowing Bitcoin\u0027s release, the products that have emerged using blockchains have been at the center of most people\u0027s interest. There isn\u0027t much left to tokenize that hasn\u0027t already been attempted, and new cryptocurrencies do not gain much attention because they are just more of what is already available. Decentralized applications and decentralized financial services are more common.\n\nBlockchain developers continue to work on scaling issues, transaction throughput, centralization concerns, and more—with new blockchains emerging all the time. But similar to the cryptocurrencies created using blockchains, more blockchains are just more of the same.\n\nWeb 3 development is underway, but whether it will gain traction is unclear. There is still a long road ahead and developers face many challenges—primarily convincing those who have monetized the web\u0027s infrastructure to release their interests in favor of allowing the dream of decentralization to be realized.\n\nBlockchain development, as the average person understands it (the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, technology behind Web 3) is expected to continue growing, but it\u0027s possible that it will slow in favor of newer technology.\n\nIf the Blockchain Boom Stalls, What\u0027s Next?\n\nBlockchain brought about the realization that data and information can be immutable and accurate. Next came developments in artificial intelligence, which progressed as rapidly as blockchain did after Bitcoin was popularized.\n\nLatest developments point to a merger of three technologies—immutable and accurate data, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence. The theory is that, eventually, this merger will bring authenticity to data, augment businesses with vast amounts of internal and external data, automate many costly processes, and reduce the time needed in decision-making by providing accurate and data-backed recommendations.\n\nFor businesses, this translates into reduced costs and streamlined operations. For investors, it means companies that invest in incorporating blockchain and AI solutions are likely to be more accurate in reporting, more profitable, and more trustworthy.\n\nTo remain competitive, businesses are going to need blockchains backing them because they create trust and can automate many processes. Artificial intelligence can analyze vast amounts of data and facilitate decision-making or even initiate smart contract execution, speeding up processes tremendously.\n\nSmall businesses won\u0027t be able to keep up, so they will need to determine if they could benefit from blockchain+AI-as-a-service solutions, another emerging service.\n\nQuite possibly, the next iteration of blockchain development will be an industry that combines all blockchain and AI developments. This industry is expected by some to grow exponentially in the near future.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrency and is where most development and research are focused. It is becoming more popular as more use cases are conceived and people learn more about it.\n\n",

The fact that the ledger is distributed across each part of the network helps to facilitate the security of the blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grew intensely popular among the general financial and investment worlds in late 2017 and early 2018, they have since become more of a niche area for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, blockchain technology remains a quickly-growing area of growth for companies across a host of industries. It is possible that blockchain technology will ultimately be seen as the most important innovation to come out of the cryptocurrency boom. Below, we\u0027ll take a closer look at blockchain and see why this technology could be valuable to businesses of all kinds.\n\nBasics of Blockchain\n\nDepending upon the blockchain, parties may be able to view previous ledger entries and record new entries, although most blockchain networks have complex rules for the addition of new groups of records, \"blocks,\" to the chain of previous records. The blocks and the contents within them are protected by powerful cryptography, which insures that previous transactions within the network cannot be either forged or destroyed. In this way, blockchain technology allows a digital currency to maintain a trusted transaction network without relying on a central authority. It is for this reason that digital currencies are thought of as \"decentralized.\"While blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating the rise of digital currencies over the past several years, there are also many other non-cryptocurrency uses for this technology. Indeed, some blockchain proponents believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact, and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered. As such, it\u0027s likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it\u0027s being utilized in any number of other applications.\n\nCross-Border Payments\n\nTraditionally, the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow, and especially for payments taking place across international borders. One reason for this is that, when multiple currencies are involved, the transfer process typically requires the participation of multiple banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can actually collect his or her money. There are existing services to help facilitate this process in a faster way, but these tend to by quite expensive.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross-border payments methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain may allow for costs just a fraction of that, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds. There are hurdles to be passed, including regulation of cryptocurrencies in different parts of the world and security concerns. Nonetheless, this is one of the most promising and talked about areas of blockchain technology application.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are often seen as a highly powerful application of blockchain technology. These contracts are actually computer programs that can oversee all aspects of an agreement, from facilitation to execution. When conditions are met, smart contracts can be entirely self-executing and self-enforcing. For proponents of smart contracts, these tools provide a more secure, more automated alternative to traditional contract law, as well as an application that is faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n\nThe potential applications of smart contract technology are essentially limitless and could extend to almost any field of business in which contract law would normally apply. Of course, while highly touted, smart contracts are not a magical substitute for old-fashioned diligence. In fact, the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a cautionary tale and a warning to investors to not assume that smart contracts are any better than the information and organization that a user puts into them. Nonetheless, smart contracts remain one of the most exciting ways that blockchain technology has already extended beyond the cryptocurrency space and into the broader business world.\n\nIdentity Management\n\nOne of the most problematic results of the internet age has been identity security. As diligent as many individuals and organizations are in maintaining their online identities and securing private information, there are always nefarious actors looking to steal and profit off of these digital items. Blockchain technology has already demonstrated the potential for transforming the way that online identity management takes place.\n\nBlockchain offers a tremendous level of security, thanks to independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network. In digital currency cases, this verification is used to approve transaction blocks before they are added to the chain. This mechanism could just as easily be applied to other types of verification procedures, including identity verification and many other applications as well.\n\nThe applications for blockchain and identity management are wide-ranging. For instance, blockchain could potentially be used to aid in maintaining voter information and ensuring proper functioning of the electoral process. Blockchain could be used to securely and efficiently transfer user data across platforms and systems. The technology could also be used to maintain and protect records of real estate ownership, titles, and more.\n\nSupply Chain Uses\n\nFor many businesses across various industries, a key to success is a well-functioning, efficient supply chain. Blockchain technology has already been used in multiple industries as a means of keeping tabs on supply chains and ensuring their efficiency. This could eliminate human work and the potential for error from a complex and crucial process.\n\nAt this point, blockchain is a technology with an exceptionally broad set of potential uses. Although blockchain is most famous for its connections to the blossoming cryptocurrency world, several other applications have already been explored. Perhaps even more exciting, though, is that new ways of utilizing blockchain emerge every day. As such, whether you are directly involved in the digital currency space or not, it\u0027s essential to develop an understanding of blockchain and how it may be used to transform the business and investment worlds.

    "content": "What Is Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)?\n\nBlockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies in the business of building blockchain applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the growing field of blockchain technology. The application of blockchain technology has moved well beyond its best-known use in cryptocurrency transactions and has broadened to address secure transactions of all kinds. As a result, there is a demand for hosting services.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBaaS is based on the software as a service (SaaS) model and works in a similar fashion. It allows customers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host, and operate their own blockchain apps and related functions on the blockchain. At the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure agile and operational.\n\nAs a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting blockchain adoption across businesses.\n\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:Consumers and businesses are increasingly willing to adapt to blockchain technology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead involved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure often act as a barrier.\n\nBaaS offers an external service provider to set up all the necessary blockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. Once created, the provider continues to handle the complex back-end operations for the client.\n\nThe BaaS operator typically offers support activities, such as bandwidth management, suitable allocation of resources, hosting requirements, and data security features. The BaaS operator frees the client to focus on the core job: the functionality of the blockchain.\n\nExample of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBelow is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service Hyperledger Cello, a BaaS-like blockchain module toolkit and utility system under the Hyperledger project.\n\nIn fact, a BaaS’ provider\u0027s role is similar to that of a web hosting provider. The website creators create and run all the website content on their own personal computers. They may hire support staff or sign up with an external hosting provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party companies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.\n\nBaaS may be the catalyst that leads to a wider and deeper penetration of blockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead of creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can now simply outsource the technically complex work and focus on its core activities.\n\n",

It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, and includes member organizations that are leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and technology. Several sub-projects exist, including Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Composer, and Cello. Hyperledger varies from Bitcoin as it is not a cryptocurrency but instead used to develop frameworks and tools. Hyperledger uses a consensus layer, smart contract layer, communication layer, and API.\n\nThe Linux Foundation has launched over 70 open sourced organizations with Hyperledger being among the fastest growing.\n\nHyperledger was founded in 2016 with 30 founding corporate members.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Hyperledger?\n\nHyperledger is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open-source blockchains and related applications for use across various industries. Hyperledger\u0027s projects include a variety of enterprise-ready permissioned blockchain platforms, where network participants are known to one another and therefore have an intrinsic interest in participating in the consensus-making process.\n\nUsing the available components under the Hyperledger umbrella, a business can apply various modular blockchain solutions and services to significantly improve the performance of their operations and the efficiency of their business processes.\n\nUnderstanding Hyperledger\n\nThe Hyperledger project was created in December 2015 by the San Francisco, California–based Linux Foundation. It started with 30 member firms and has grown to about 140 member companies today.\n\nHyperledger was set up with the aim of accelerating industry-wide collaboration for developing high-performance and reliable blockchain and distributed ledger-based technology framework that could be used across the various industry sectors to enhance the efficiency, performance, and transactions of the various business processes.\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration that includes leading businesses from the fields of finance, banking, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, manufacturing and production, and technology. They include big names like Bosch, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Deloitte, Hitachi, American Express, JP Morgan, and Visa, in addition to a host of blockchain-based startups like ConsenSys.\n\nHyperledger\u0027s Organizational Structure\n\nEssentially, Hyperledger is not an organization, a cryptocurrency network, or a blockchain system. It does not support a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but it works by providing the necessary infrastructure and standards for developing various blockchain-based systems and applications for industrial use. Think of Hyperledger as a hub, where various individual blockchain-based projects and tools that adhere to its defined design philosophy operate under its umbrella.\n\nThe various projects include the following:All such projects under the Hyperledger umbrella follow the design methodology that supports a modular and extensible approach, interoperability, and security features. The projects remain agnostic to a particular token or cryptocurrency, though a user can create one as required.\n\nHyperledger Technology Layers\n\nIn terms of the architecture, Hyperledger uses the following key business components:Hyperledger vs. Bitcoin\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Hyperledger is vastly different from Bitcoin in that it is not a cryptocurrency. The fundamental purpose and nature of the technology is to develop enterprise-grade blockchain frameworks and tools. While Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, Hyperledger is more geared towards facilitating business processes.\n\nHyperledger frameworks are often private, permissioned blockchains meaning permission to the network is limited to a small number of trusted users. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a public blockchain meaning anyone can participate in the network. Each uses a different form of consensus mechanism as well, as Bitcoin transactions are substantiated using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism while Hyperledger supports Byzantine fault tolerance or other algorithms.\n\nAs hinted to in the previous paragraph, Bitcoin is decentralized. This means no single entity owns it, and the system relies on the collection of the network\u0027s participants. Alternatively, Hyperledger is governed by the Linux Foundation.\n\nLast, Bitcoin is not known for its smart contracts. It\u0027s primary use is to store value, not support complex programmability to facilitate agreements. Alternatively, Hyperledger offers greater smart contract capabilities. This allows businesses to engage in complex agreements relying heavily on logic to distribute assets on a blockchain network.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Linux Foundation is home to the Hyperledger open-source collaborative project which aims to provide business-grade blockchain frameworks and technologies. Businesses may build private, permissioned blockchain networks for a variety of use cases. Hyperledger uses include supply chain management and smart contracts, and Hyperledger is known for its modular and adaptable solutions.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The FAANGs are expected to dominate stock market. How are they doing on the blockchain front?\n\n",
    "content": "For investors, blockchain and FAANG are two magic words that can move markets. Mere association of a stock with those two words can make a stock seem more attractive. (See also: Riot Stock Rallies As Blockchain Tech Goes Mainstream.)Investor enthusiasm for blockchain and FAANG is due to their future bullish prospects. Even as FAANG dominates the internet ecosystem, blockchain is set to reinvent the internet and its associated services. Here is a brief primer on how each of the FAANG companies is preparing for the blockchain future.\n\nFacebook Inc. (FB)\n\nFacebook recently announced a high-profile reorganization, moving prominent executives from successful product lines, and placing them into positions of authority within a newly formed blockchain group. David Marcus, who previously headed the company’s successful Messenger services, said the intent of his “small group” was to “explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.” (See also: Facebook\u0027s Bad News. Good News For Blockchain?)The threat to Facebook stems from an inversion of its current business model, where it makes money by selling user data to advertisers. A blockchain world envisages users who have personal control of their data and choose to share it only with parties that they trust. It is still a while before that future comes to pass. According to Spencer Bogart, a venture capitalist at Blockchain Capital, blockchain is not “an existential threat to Facebook today”. But it might become one in the future. “That’s why they [Facebook] want to be smart and stay engaged,” he said.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL)\n\nAccording to reports, Alphabet Inc.\u0027s subsidiary Google plans to use blockchain for securing customer data on its cloud services. The idea is to have a white label version for companies to use on their servers. Google has also invested in blockchain startups through its venture investing arm Google Ventures (GV). The companies in GV’s portfolio comprise a diverse palette. For example, crypto wallet provider LedgerX is one of their investments as is bank transfer company Ripple. As with Facebook, it is still too early to quantify the impact of these investments on Google’s bottom line in the near term.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN)\n\nAmazon competitor Walmart Inc. (WMT) made news last year when it announced a supply chain implementation of blockchain last year to enable customers to determine provenance of its consumer goods. It would seem that Amazon has taken a different route. The Seattle-based company launched AWS Blockchain Templates in its cloud service recently to deploy frameworks for ethereum and Hyperledger on its cloud platform recently. The offering is part of its plan to offer Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Competitors to Amazon in this arena include International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL). (See also: All About Amazon\u0027s New Blockchain.)Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nThe iPhone maker has been characteristically silent regarding its blockchain moves. But Coindesk discovered a patent filed by Apple last December that makes use of blockchain technology to create timestamps. In its patent application, the company said that blockchain technology can be used to build resilience in a distributed system of elements, such as a SIM or MicroSD card. The timestamps are part of a “multi-check architecture” system proposed by Apple. Timestamps will be verified by another system before they are added to the main chain. (See also: Is Apple Planning to Use Blockchain?)Netflix Inc. (NFLX)\n\nOf all the companies within the FAANG group, Netflix is, perhaps, most threatened by blockchain. The video-streaming company has not made any announcements regarding investments in blockchain, but the drumrolls for its demise due to blockchain have already begun. A popular post by Rizwan Virk earlier this year outlined a scenario where a decentralized platform using blockchain technology could get rid of the centralized architecture and traditional gatekeepers of the content business. While it has displaced cable and disrupted linear television viewing habits, Netflix is still the gatekeeper to content on its platform. As such, content makers still need its stamp of approval before their content can be viewed. In the decentralized world, content makers and technology entrepreneurs will be able to make and stream their own content on a subject of their own choosing. The token model could also upend existing business models by making it possible to purchase individual shows with tokens on an entertainment network.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "summary": "In the massive world of online advertising, blockchain will be a force to reckon with.\n\n",
    "content": "In the massive world of online advertising, blockchain will be a force to reckon with. Unlike with some blockchain products such as cryptocurrency, advertising can employ blockchain in a plethora of unique ways. The applications of this technology in advertising will help ad creatives target audiences better, share data, make users safer and more private, and democratize who controls the data that the industry relies on.\n\nA New Direction for Advertising\n\nOne of the most notable features of blockchain as a finance application is anonymity. While this is a product of blockchain’s origins in bitcoin, for advertising, anonymity is sometimes counter-productive. Blockchain solutions for advertising will instead make use of the robust accountability that the technology provides, wiping the slate clean for all participants.\n\nBlockchains built since the original (bitcoin) have expanded upon the importance of such transparency, and many of the most influential chains will find their killer apps in the advertising world. Companies like Papyrus exemplify this trend, with platforms that make it easy for users to know exactly who is paying to advertise to them, and where their data is coming from. With Papyrus, these users can even decide not to share any of their browsing habits or other usage data, though if they do, advertisers can pay them for it directly.\n\nFrom the user side, this is preferable to the excess of ceaseless, inaccurate ads that bombard us daily. Advertisers might be put off at first, but will quickly realize that the system works in their favor as well.\n\nThis type of schema is a far cry from the current way of doing things, which sees users voluntarily surrender their most personal information with little reward. These are the “terms and conditions” that most people skip over when setting up new applications. With new, blockchain-based platforms like Papyrus and MetaX, all those with a stake in advertising will share resources, see the entire flow of information in the same place, and have an even playing field that allows for more efficient competition.\n\nAnother venture, Bitcomo – a blockchain-driven lead generation platform – is creating a smart contract-based advertising model (pre-sale ICO kicks off on September 18) in which payment is due once results been delivered or after generating a smart contract-triggered sale. Bitcomo offers a solution to the traditional advertising model in which publishers are at the mercy of advertisers who are not always able to pay the entire commission as a protection against leads that were not approved.\n\nSimilarly, advertisers cannot be certain they are getting their money\u0027s worth and are often forced to blacklist publishers who may be conducting fraudulent activities. (See also: Investing in Cryptocurrencies: What to Keep In Mind.)Kanstruktor over at Steemit explains: \"Decentralized network between advertisers and publishers through caching, and logging of clicks and leads, key statistics, personalized nodes in the blockchain operator MetaHash (fork of Ethereum – ERC20). It is a basic principle of protection against fraud and concealment of data on actual transactions from advertisers, or making unrealistic target bots in the traffic of publishers instead of real users.\"Blockchain’s Advertising Chops\n\nFor online advertising, data is precious. It reveals patterns in one’s shopping and search history, comprises social media posts and leaves priceless clues behind. Blockchain distributes this data to the entire network, whereas it was once kept on secure company servers and put up for sale to bidders with a relevant interest.\n\nApart from functionality that gives users more control, and puts the value of their data exclusively in their hands, this decentralized system benefits ad creators as well. They will have access to immense shared pools of relevant data, already vetted by other participants and proven with the chain, making ad targeting much more accurate and much less expensive. Blockchain’s irrefutable, ledger-like system is a perfect tool in the hands of ad companies whose bread and butter are key performance indicators like clicks and likes.\n\nInstead of paying upfront for expensive ad space targeting fishermen, for instance, the same fishing gear company can use a blockchain advertising company to target those who have expressly stated (with their data-sharing preferences) that they are interested in such gear. The game will no longer be based on flighty browsing habits, but on hard data. Moreover, smart contract ad buying solutions make it possible for companies to buy conditional space, which will only show an ad should the target fulfill certain parameters.\n\nBlockchain’s Future in Advertising\n\nOnline advertising companies are just now beginning to develop real use cases for blockchain in their daily activities, and those who get ahead of the curve sooner will benefit greatly. Blockchain is the ultimate democratization tool, and while those who currently protect the status quo are right to be afraid, at some point everyone will realize that an open system creates as many opportunities as it takes away.\n\nThe future is fast in coming, and instead of predicting it, the fast movers are already making it happen.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Piracy could cost the television and movie industries $52 billion by 2022, but blockchain technology could potentially play a role to control that.\n\nDigital piracy costs the U.S. economy an estimated loss of domestic revenues of at least $29.2 billion each year, along with an estimated reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion. Using blockchain technology could be one strategy to help in the effort to halt digital piracy. In theory, a blockchain Internet and distributed ledger technology (DLT) could help prevent pirates from hiding their unlawful piracy activities online. Companies are already using blockchain to prevent piracy through content surveillance and digital watermarking.\n\nThe estimated number of viewings of U.S.-produced movies that are pirated digitally each year.\n\n",
    "content": "In a study produced by the Global Innovation Policy Center for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, global online piracy costs the U.S. economy at least $29.2 billion and as much as $71 billion in lost domestic revenues each year.\n\nWhile this figure is significant, it doesn\u0027t take into account the annual losses to the U.S. economy in jobs and in the reduced gross domestic product (GDP). The report estimates digital video piracy results in between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion in reduced U.S. GDP per year along with losses of between 230,000 and 560,000 jobs.﻿﻿To be sure, media companies have taken steps to protect their content from piracy, but this has not been enough to fully cut off the process. Now, analysts have speculated that blockchain technology could potentially play a role in the control of this content and the protection against piracy going forward.\n\nBlockchain as a Player in the Fight\n\nWhile blockchain is unlikely to be able to address piracy fully on its own, blockchain technology could be best put toward this cause as one component of a larger effort to stop piracy.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that there are many potential reasons why piracy takes place, and experts have yet to arrive at a definitive explanation for the practice. Various factors like cultural norms, lack of access, unaffordability, and even a general view of media content as not having inherent value can all contribute to piracy activities.\n\nIn theory, if the Internet were built on blockchain technology, it could become impossible or, at the very least, extremely difficult for pirates to unlawfully share and profit from media content. The reason for this, presumably, is that a blockchain Internet would allow for the tracking of unlawful actions via distributed ledger technology (DLT). Individuals would not be able to hide their piracy activities as they can now. However, a blockchain Internet remains speculative.\n\nContent Surveillance\n\nOne way that blockchain can help to prevent piracy at this stage is through content surveillance. Vevue is a blockchain streaming service developing a technology to track the life cycle of media content. Founder Thomas Olson has indicated that \"if someone copies content tracked by our technology by any possible means, including videoing or recording a screen, our platform will be able to identify the owner of the device/system where the content was last played.\"﻿﻿In this case, blockchain itself does not track the content; this is dependent upon a unique computational process inherent in Vevue\u0027s project. However, blockchain would allow the surveillance data to be stored and shared efficiently. Put another way, blockchain is a record that Vevue\u0027s team can use to assist in the tracking actions of its proprietary technology.\n\nBounty Hunting\n\nBlockchain can also help with the process of digital watermarking, a process akin to bounty hunting. South African company CustosTech has used the bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to build a proprietary digital watermarking technology. This technology allows the embedding of a monetary reward, like BTC tokens, in media files. These watermarks are embedded in such a way as to be imperceptible to the content receiver and impossible to remove. If a file is pirated, CustosTech can analyze the watermark for that file to determine who the legal recipient of the file was.\n\nThe fact that a monetary reward can be encoded in the process as well could serve as an incentive for those outside of the media space to help find pirated files. Indeed, CustosTech\u0027s bounty-hunting program is available to anyone. By helping to track down pirated files, hunters can earn rewards in BTC.\n\nThe idea of rewarding users with cryptocurrency for their assistance in fighting piracy translates to the project of Rawg, a cross-device game discovery platform, as well. This company is aiming to create a blockchain system that rewards video gamers with cryptocurrency tokens for achievements they earn in the game itself. Gamers are only able to synchronize their achievements for token rewards with non-pirated games and on official platforms. In this sense, Rawg is not offering a bounty-hunting reward but rather an incentive for gamers to avoid piracy on their own.\n\nMany other projects are exploring the anti-piracy space and using blockchain technology. Are they likely to fully eradicate the practice? No, but they very well may help to reduce the amount of revenue lost as a result.\n\n",

    "content": "Blockchain is emerging as a powerful technological force that promises to change the travel industry’s status quo. In fact, it\u0027s already being heralded as a game-changer for many different industries. Remember that blockchain is a type of database that is commonly used in the cryptocurrency market wherein data is stored in blocks and then chained together.\n\nServices that are based on blockchain are already isolating major pain points in a very fragmented industry—travel and tourism. It should come as no surprise that this sector is broken up into different parts. Think flights, hotels, car rentals, among other factors. So how can blockchain help? These services are able to ease hurdles in the industry by resolving common challenges and streamlining processes while building a more equitable ecosystem that shuns gatekeepers.\n\nThe technology’s impact is more than hypothetical, though, with several businesses disrupting several nodes on the industry’s supply chain. The following five companies are improving key aspects of the travel ecosystem and establishing blockchain’s place in the industry.\n\n1. Winding Tree: Displacing Online Booking Hubs\n\nMajor travel service aggregators like Expedia and Priceline dominate airfare bookings. But this comes at a serious cost to both travelers and airlines. Booking through these websites often includes hefty fees and surcharges made possible by their largely unchallenged status as gatekeepers. Blockchain-based startup Winding Tree works to unseat these entrenched giants by challenging their role as industry middlemen.\n\nWinding Tree is a private company based in Switzerland. Founded in 2017, it reaches numerous parts of the travel and tourism industry, including hotels and airfare. The company uses \"blockchain technology to enable a fair and competitive travel distribution market.\"The company seeks to connect travelers directly with service providers like airlines, hotels, and tour guides with its LÍF token. The aim is to minimize fees for travelers while reducing costs for service providers. LÍF is Winding Tree\u0027s platform cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company’s clever use of smart contracts and the ERC827 protocol delivers better savings for every stakeholder in the travel and tourism industry. Winding Tree\u0027s nonprofit status assures there are no middlemen adding unnecessary fees to the booking process.\n\n2. Webjet: Adding Assurances and Avoiding Inaccuracies\n\nInaccurate or lost hotel bookings add considerable stress and anxiety to a travel experience. When this happens, customers usually have to take on fees across several layers of the supply chain while providers consistently extract value.\n\nThanks to blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger technology, Webjet has built a new model designed to avoid these irritating booking experiences. The company is a prominent online travel agency based in Australia and was founded in 1998. Webjet claims that it is Australia and New Zealand\u0027s leading online agency and is a leader in online tools and technology.\n\nWebjet officially launched its blockchain platform in 2019. The system enhances the customer experience by recording all entries on the blockchain’s immutable ledger, which reduces the likelihood of mistaken or lost bookings and reduces the layers between sellers and consumers. It does this by locating real-time data problems that may occur between customers, agents, and hotels and sending messages to every party.\n\nThe technology’s improved security features provide better protection for the ecosystem. Apart from building greater supply chain efficiencies and reducing costs for hotels, travelers ultimately benefit from lower-cost bookings along with more transparency and greater accountability.\n\n3. Sandblock: Improving Loyalty’s Fungibility\n\nLoyalty rewards have gone through several iterations in the competitive travel and tourism industry. Many frequent travelers belong to airline and hotel loyalty programs. Spending points and miles often means jumping through multiple hoops to redeem rewards. Despite high participation rates in loyalty programs, many customers report a willingness to accept better deals from competing carriers and service providers if the price is right.\n\nSandblock is one of the newest entrants to this part of the industry. Founded in 2017, Sandblock is based in France. It aims to change the loyalty landscape with its blockchain-based platform by allowing travel providers to create their own loyalty tokens, which can be exchanged for brand-specific rewards. Not only that but they can also be used like real coins and exchanged for fiat money.\n\nUsers can also apply their tokens to redeem rewards across a variety of services beyond the company that awarded them and can earn more by being active participants in the community. For businesses, the reward is better data and transparency, and an ecosystem that actually returns value thanks to improved targeting and happier consumers.\n\n4. Accenture: Striving Towards Shorter Lines\n\nSpending hours waiting in lines at airports is one of the major annoyances of traveling the globe not just for travelers but also for airlines and airport staff. Congestion can add to the time spent in lines for security, customs, and passport control. Security needs are also trumpeted as the reason for tighter controls and oversight, all of which contribute to frequent travelers\u0027 headaches.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and expedite the security process, Accenture (ACN) developed the Known Traveler Digital Identity System. The consulting firm partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to help disrupt the global travel industry.\n\nThis blockchain is designed to collect and host identifying information from frequent international travelers, enabling a freer flow of data between travelers and customs agents to ease the clearance process.\n\nThis allows travelers to gain control over their digital identities with better security thanks to distributed ledger technology. Airports and airlines benefit from accelerated processing and better security, helping shorten lines all while alleviating one of the biggest traveler pain points.\n\n5. TravelChain: Making the Most of Data\n\nData is a prized commodity in today’s economy. It offers businesses insights and advantages when used appropriately. Data generated by travelers, which is highly valuable to service providers, is generally restricted to gatekeepers such as Expedia and Orbitz. These companies offer a faster booking process at a price. This raises costs and adds to the informational asymmetry for service providers.\n\nTravelChain is a new entrant that wants to upend the paradigm with an open-source blockchain. The Russian company seeks to remove intermediaries on the supply chain. Users are empowered to collect and monetize their travel data, keeping it safe from prying eyes and receiving tokens as compensation for sharing with travel service providers. These tokens can then be redeemed for services or money.\n\nParticipating companies can access more granular information about travelers, channeling these insights for more pinpointed promotion targeting. Apart from personalizing marketing, these companies can offer customized tours and promotions based on a traveler’s preferences, closing the entire ecosystem loop and delivering value to all stakeholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTraveling should be comfortable, cost-effective, and most importantly, enjoyable. While fees, booking irregularities, bad reviews, and long lines may be symptomatic of the current travel environment, blockchain is challenging this status quo with a host of new services designed to modernize and streamline the travel experience.\n\nThanks to the formation of more equitable ecosystems constructed to reduce the presence of intermediaries, travelers and service providers can build more mutually fulfilling relationships that contribute to better overall value.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Read about the Bitcoin blockchain, a public ledger shared among all Bitcoin users that records information about every single Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is essentially an enormous, shared, encrypted list of all addresses that hold Bitcoin balances. Blockchains consist of a series of individual blocks, arranged in chronological order based on the order of transactions. While a blockchain can be used to store any number of data points (votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, etc.), Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain is essentially an enormous, shared, encrypted list of all addresses that hold Bitcoin balances. Because this list is shared, it is referred to as a digital distributed ledger technology (DLT). Every new block represents the latest update to account balances. A block simply refers to a set of Bitcoin transactions that are related because they took place within the same time period. New blocks are created after further mining takes place or a transaction occurs where Bitcoin is exchanged.\n\nBlocks are stacked on top of each other in such a way that one block depends on the previous. In this manner, a chain of blocks is created; this is where the term \"blockchain\" comes from. When a transaction is submitted to the Bitcoin network, the information is passed on through all Bitcoin nodes—all computers connected to other computers in the blockchain—at the same time (through the blockchain).\n\nThe Function of a Blockchain\n\nIn this way, it functions much like a public ledger, accounting for economic transactions and providing a way to verify that all Bitcoin users have been equipped with the same information. Everyone can download a copy of the blockchain and use it to trace the path of Bitcoins from one Bitcoin transaction to another. (It should be noted that although there is a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made, they are linked to a specific Bitcoin address, rather than a personally-identifying name or email. For this reason, Bitcoin is considered pseudonymous.)The goal of a blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed to every participant, but never edited. This permanence is called immutability, which is a crucial feature of the blockchain data architecture. While a blockchain can be used to store any number of data points (votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, etc.), Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments.\n\nIn a blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. For Bitcoin, this data includes the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions. If one node has an error in its data, it can use the thousands of other nodes as a reference point to correct itself.\n\nInformation Contained in Each Block\n\nBlockchains consist of a series of individual blocks, arranged in chronological order based on the order of transactions. There are two parts to the information contained in a block.\n\nThe first part consists of the header elements: information about the location and other data related to the transactions contained within that block. For example, a hash within the header points to the previous block. There are no hashes for genesis blocks because these blocks have no predecessor. A merkle tree—a data structure used in computer science to record transactions—is used to display the sequence of transactions contained within the block. Another hash within the block contains timestamp information, the nonce, and the difficulty level. Here is a brief explanation of each of these components:The second part is the identifier information. Again, this is a cryptographic hash function. It is generated by hashing the header elements twice in a row.\n\nBlockchain More Anonymous Than a Bank Statement\n\nOne of the alleged benefits (or risks, depending on your outlook) of Bitcoin is its unique anonymity. Those transacting in Bitcoins are supposed to be tied to a specific Bitcoin address, rather than a personally-identifying name or email. Yet anonymity is somewhat compromised because of the blockchain information ledger.﻿﻿Since every transaction is publicly logged, one single breach of ownership identity could lead to the revelation of many other owners by simply following back the transactions. The blockchain is still more anonymous than a bank statement, but it is not an impenetrable veil of secrecy, as some proponents of Bitcoin technology like to assert.\n\n",

    "title": "How Blockchain Will Revolutionize Future Cars\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain has been flexing its muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense untapped potential.\n\nIn order for autonomous cars to enter the mainstream, they must continue to improve their ability to collect and communicate data from their surrounding environment. To maintain safety, driverless cars must constantly be aware of conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Using blockchain\u0027s decentralized ledger, driverless cars could have access to key traffic data almost simultaneously and more accurately. Enabled by blockchain technology, smart contracts could simplify many aspects of driving, such as paying for car insurance, repairs, and tolls.\n\nIn its 2021 annual automated vehicle survey, the American Automobile Association (AAA) found that only 14% of drivers would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself.\n\n",
    "content": "The future’s cars have long since moved from our imagination into the real world. High-profile successes and failures have created a polarized discussion surrounding the industry’s outlook, but no conclusions have emerged.\n\nAs more automakers contemplate the direction of the industry, there are still too many unanswered questions. For one, companies continue to focus exclusively on their cars, and not on the ecosystem they drive in. Even so, the emergence of blockchain as a viable way to store and communicate data seamlessly is a promising addition to the equation.\n\nThe key ingredient in successful autonomous vehicle deployment is creating environments that foster two-way communication between cars and their supporting infrastructure. While the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities have taken this in a positive direction, blockchain technology delivers a significant upgrade that could revolutionize the future of driving.\n\nConnecting Cars and Cities\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to autonomous cars entering the mainstream is the fact that they are still not connected enough to their surrounding environment. While cars can perceive millions of data points per second, they must view them in isolation and without context.\n\nUsing IoT devices improves this functionality significantly as they can collect and communicate crucial contextual data to cars to improve their performance. This includes information about road conditions, traffic accidents, and other cars on the road that could affect a vehicle’s ability to drive.\n\nEven so, IoT devices remain bound by the limitations current technology imposes on them. Centralization makes data vulnerable, and the inability to communicate data rapidly between points reduces its usefulness in real-time situations. However, blockchain technology can significantly enhance the status quo.\n\nSAE International’s Levels of Driving Automation for On-Road VehiclesSource: SAE InternationalBlockchain Advantages\n\nAn advantageous benefit blockchain brings to the table is the ability to spread data more efficiently and rapidly. Driverless cars must constantly be aware of a few key factors: the conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Traditional IoT makes this process complex because of its communication protocols.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralized ledger means that each node in the network—in this case each car and data point—has access to all data almost simultaneously, and more accurately. Companies are already working on integrating better vehicle tracking and communication to improve overall connectivity. Creating decentralized networks that more seamlessly transfer data to all points is the first step toward building a safe driverless ecosystem.\n\nPutting Microservices on the Blockchain\n\nAnother increasingly popular use case for blockchain technology in driverless cars is improving transactions that occur repeatedly between vehicles as well as vehicles and the infrastructure around them. It may not seem significant, but it could reduce friction at several points, advance communication, and reduce traffic bottlenecks.\n\nAn important area where this will likely be employed relates to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) microtransactions. In this model, car owners could use tokens—such as Streamr’s DATA token—to pay for data they require from other cars. This could include weather forecasts, gas prices nearby, congestion data, and more. Vehicles could then earn tokens simply by sharing their data or choosing to sell it to advertisers or manufacturers. With this strategy, blockchain creates a V2V closed ecosystem that incentivizes and rewards participation simultaneously.\n\nIn terms of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), blockchain offers cars a significantly streamlined payment ecosystem that is designed to simplify many aspects of driving. Instead of having to manually pay for multiple things—car maintenance, tolls, insurance, and more—blockchain could enable automated payments thanks to smart contracts.\n\nA shining example of an attribute smart contracts could improve is usage-based insurance (UBI). Instead of paying yearly insurance premiums that can vary thanks to murky factors, drivers could automate their insurance to be paid based on usage.\n\nThese UBI systems require significant data input to ensure accurate quotes and premiums for drivers. However, by tapping into public blockchains, insurers could instantly calculate a driver’s premium and simply execute pre-existing smart contracts to automate payments.\n\nOne other interesting application of blockchain-based microservices for vehicles relates to ride-sharing. The sector is currently controlled by ride-hailing applications like Uber and Lyft, but there is increasing competition emerging from popular ride-sharing services like Google’s Waze, which instead emphasizes carpooling over taxis.\n\nThe Toyota Research Institute (TRI) has already made some headway in terms of studying and planning for integrating the automotive sector with blockchain. TRI works with several startups to create systems that improve ride-sharing via blockchain, possibly even including car sharing for seats and empty trunk space. In April 2021, Toyota bought \"Level 5,\" the self-driving research department of Lyft.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain has been flexing its disruptive muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense potential. By changing smaller aspects of the driving experience and improving the security of drivers on the road, the technology could prove a revolutionary catalyst for a more autonomous experience. As more automakers and infrastructure businesses discover new ways to integrate blockchain, consumers will soon bear witness to the transportation transformation spurred by distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\n",

    "title": "Hard Fork: What It Is in Blockchain, How It Works, Why It Happens\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A hard fork is a radical change to the protocol of a blockchain network that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid—or vice-versa.\n\nA hard fork refers to a radical change to the protocol of a blockchain network that effectively results in two branches, one that follows the previous protocol and one that follows the new version. In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying. A hard fork can occur in any blockchain, and not only Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others, for example).\n\nAs the graphic below displays, nodes that are not upgraded reject the new rules, which creates a divergence, or hard fork, in the blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Hard Fork?\n\nA hard fork (or hardfork), as it relates to blockchain technology, is a radical change to a network\u0027s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice-versa. A hard fork requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.\n\nForks may be initiated by developers or members of a crypto community who grow dissatisfied with functionalities offered by existing blockchain implementations. They may also emerge as a way to crowdsource funding for new technology projects or cryptocurrency offerings.\n\nA hard fork can be contrasted with a soft fork.\n\nUnderstanding a Hard Fork\n\nA hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain no longer accept the older version(s) of the blockchain; which creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.\n\nAdding a new rule to the code essentially creates a fork in the blockchain: one path follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other path continues along the old path. Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.\n\nHow Forks Work\n\nA fork in a blockchain can occur in any crypto-technology platform—not only Bitcoin. That is because blockchains and cryptocurrency work in basically the same way no matter which crypto platform they\u0027re on. You may think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Because the miners in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these miners understand the new rules.\n\nHowever, all of the miners need to agree about the new rules and about what comprises a valid block in the chain. So when you want to change those rules you need to \"fork it\"—like a fork in a road—to indicate that there\u0027s been a change in or a diversion to the protocol. The developers can then update all of the software to reflect the new rules.\n\nIt is through this forking process that various digital currencies with names similar to bitcoin have come to be: bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. For the casual cryptocurrency investor, it can be difficult to tell the difference between these cryptocurrencies and to map the various forks onto a timeline. To help sort this out, we have composed a history of the most important bitcoin hard forks of the past several years. Additionally, those looking to get involved with one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges need to tread carefully when investing in currencies like Bitcoin so as not to waste time and money on the wrong digital currency.\n\nReasons For a Hard Fork?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why developers may implement a hard fork, such as correcting important security risks found in older versions of the software, to add new functionality, or to reverse transactions—such as when the Ethereum blockchain created a hard fork to reverse the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\n\nAfter the hack, the Ethereum community almost unanimously voted in favor of a hard fork to roll back transactions that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their ether (ETH) funds returned.\n\nThe proposal for a hard fork did not exactly unwind the network’s transaction history. Rather, it relocated the funds tied to the DAO to a newly created smart contract with the single purpose of letting the original owners withdraw their funds.\n\nDAO token holders could withdraw ETH at a rate of approximately 1 ETH to 100 DAO. The extra balance of tokens and any ether that remained as a result of the hard fork was withdrawn and distributed by the DAO curators to provide \"failsafe protection\" for the organization.\n\nHard Forks vs. Soft Forks\n\nHard forks and soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform\u0027s existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.\n\nWith a soft fork, only one blockchain will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains, and a soft fork is meant to result in one.\n\nConsidering the differences in security between hard and soft forks, almost all users and developers call for a hard fork, even when a soft fork seems like it could do the job. Overhauling the blocks in a blockchain requires a tremendous amount of computing power, but the privacy gained from a hard fork makes more sense than using a soft fork.\n\n",

    "title": "Blockchain Technology Could Revolutionize Traditional Banking\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry.\n\n",
    "content": "One of the biggest threats to the banking sector today is technology. Whether it is coming from large technology firms such as Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL), eBay Inc. (EBAY) or Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), or from new financial technology (FinTech) start-ups, traditional banks are beginning to take notice, and some of them are now taking part as well.\n\nOne potential disrupter for the financial industry today comes from applications involving blockchain technology—the tamper-proof system of distributed ledgers that underlie cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Large financial institutions, from investment banks to stock exchanges to central banks, are all beginning to work on their own blockchain-based solutions in order to stay on top of this innovation.\n\nBanks Are Taking Notice\n\nBefore looking at just how blockchain technology can disrupt traditional banking, it is worth taking note of some of the key institutions that have publicly announced interest in it (meanwhile, many other banks are doing so without informing the public).\n\nPayments and Remittances\n\nThe most obvious and basic use for blockchain technology is its use as a payments system. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies act both as digital money and a method to send payments in that money form around the globe. These transactions require only an internet connection and take place instantly. While it is true that it may take many minutes for a transaction to be 100% confirmed, the transaction itself takes place in a matter of moments. These transactions are borderless, secure, and largely anonymous. Furthermore, transaction costs are minimal, costing only a few cents per transaction making it a much cheaper way to send money around the world than wire companies like Western Union (WU) and Wise or via credit card processors such as Visa Inc. (V), Mastercard Inc. (MA), or Discover Financial Services (DFS). A merchant not wanting to pay the initial and ongoing fees in order to accept credit cards could take electronic payment via a cryptocurrency instead for a fraction of the cost.\n\nRemittance overseas is a difficult undertaking. The fees are high, the processing time is slow, the money can be intercepted or stolen, and there are legal and tax issues that must be considered. A blockchain-based system would eliminate these problems. There are already dozens of companies that have been started to facilitate remittances in this way.\n\nAccount Balances and Deposits\n\nConsumers generally utilize banks to hold deposits in checking and savings accounts. But once you deposit money into a bank account, the bank loans most of it out via fractional reserve banking. As a result, most of the money that shows up when you view your account balance is not held by the bank. In fact, a bank run causes a bank to fail when too many customers attempt to withdraw their money all at the same time, and the money just isn\u0027t there. A bank account balance, therefore, is just an accounting entry.\n\nThe blockchain is ultimately a ledger that represents accounting entries. Therefore, bank accounts could come to be represented on blockchains making them more secure, accessible, and cheaper to maintain. Furthermore, it could help alleviate the risk of bank runs.\n\nSecondary Market Trading and Clearing\n\nThe simplest purchase of a company\u0027s shares to a complex over-the-counter currency swap requires clearing and settlement of trades. Ownership of the asset or contract being traded must verifiably change hands and be recorded. Today, exchange fees and clearing fees are added to the cost of each trade and can become sizable over time and given large volumes of orders.\n\nIf the ownership of shares could exist on a blockchain and any change of ownership could be immediately validated and confirmed, it would greatly reduce transaction costs and clearing costs for all sorts of asset classes from stocks to bonds to derivatives to commodities to real estate. It is entirely possible that such storied institutions as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade may one day be replaced by a distributed ledger technology that is more secure, robust, and less expensive to operate and transact on.\n\nOverstock (OSTK) recently announced it was developing a blockchain-based asset exchange called T0 in order to directly issue some of its corporate bonds to investors. New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has announced that it will roll out a blockchain-based platform to clear over-the-counter transactions which allows settling in T+10 minutes. To put that into perspective, buying a share of stock on a U.S. exchange takes T+2 days to settle.\n\nPrimary Market Issuance and IPOs\n\nIf secondary market trading can occur on blockchains, can primary markets also exist? The answer is yes. Imagine you are a company seeking to raise capital via issuing new shares to the public via an IPO. Today, this would be a very expensive undertaking requiring an investment bank (or a syndicate of such banks) to underwrite and sell your shares. This can cost up to 7% of a company\u0027s gross proceeds.\n\nNow, imagine being able to issue shares of your company by yourself directly to the blockchain where you can then sell them in exchange for money. These virtual shares can then be exchanged on secondary markets that also exist via the blockchain. If this scenario becomes accepted by the public, it could be a huge disrupter to both asset exchanges as well as the investment banking industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry. The tamper-proof, decentralized, immutable nature of the blockchain makes it ideal for reducing costs and streamlining everything from payments, asset trading, securities issuance, retail banking, and clearing and settlements. It becomes obvious that blockchain technology is much more than Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. While those implementations as payments and money systems are indeed disruptive, the greater disruption may come from alternative uses of these unique and powerful characteristics.\n\n",

    "title": "Blockchain Technology\u0027s Three Generations\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Much like the internet, it iss possible to divide the development of blockchain into stages.\n\n",
    "content": "In the development of the internet, one can point to landmark events that can be used to divide the process into stages. Among these important landmarks are the creation of the first wide-area computer networks in the 1960s, the development of an electronic mail system in the 1970s, the creation of ethernet later in that decade, the launching of the world wide web in the 1990s and the creation of the first browsers and search engines later in that decade, among others. Following each of these hallmark developments, the internet changed in a dramatic way. Each step was pivotal in creating the internet that we know and rely on today.\n\nIn a similar way, it\u0027s possible to look back on the development of blockchain and also divide it into stages which are marked off by important developments and inventions. Blockchain technology has only been in existence for a fraction of the time that the internet has, so it\u0027s likely that there are still important developments to come. Even now, though, experts have begun to divide the history of blockchain into at least three important stages.\n\nStage 1: Bitcoin and Digital Currencies\n\nWhile the ideas that would go into the blockchain were swirling around in computer science communities, it was the pseudonymous developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who outlined the blockchain as we know it in the white paper for BTC. In this way, blockchain technology began with the Bitcoin network. While blockchain has since gone on to see use in a huge variety of other areas, in some sense it was designed specially for this digital currency and for advancing the goals of digital currencies more broadly.\n\nIn the earliest stages, blockchain set up the basic premise of a shared public ledger that supports a cryptocurrency network. Satoshi\u0027s idea of blockchain makes use of 1 megabyte (MB) blocks of information on bitcoin transactions. Blocks are linked together through a complex cryptographic verification process, forming an immutable chain. Even in its earliest guises, blockchain technology set up many of the central features of these systems, which remain today. Indeed, bitcoin\u0027s blockchain remains largely unchanged from these earliest efforts.\n\nStage 2: Smart Contracts\n\nAs time went on, developers began to believe that a blockchain could do more than simply document transactions. Founders of ethereum, for instance, had the idea that assets and trust agreements could also benefit from blockchain management. In this way, ethereum represents the second-generation of the blockchain technology.\n\nThe major innovation brought about by ethereum was the advent of smart contracts. Typically, contracts in the mainstream business world are managed between two separate entities, sometimes with other entities assisting in the oversight process. Smart contracts are those that are self-managing on a blockchain. They are triggered by an event like the passing of an expiration date or the achievement of a particular price goal; in response, the smart contract manages itself, making adjustments as needed and without the input of outside entities.\n\nAt this point, we may still be in the process of harnessing the untapped potential of smart contracts. Thus, whether we have truly moved on to the subsequent stage of the development of blockchain is debatable.\n\nStage 3: The Future\n\nOne of the major issues facing blockchain is scaling. Bitcoin remains troubled by transaction processing times and bottlenecking. Many new digital currencies have attempted to revise their blockchains in order to accommodate these issues, but with varying degrees of success. In the future, one of the most important developments paving the way for blockchain technology going forward will likely have to do with scalability.\n\nBeyond this, new applications of blockchain technology are being discovered and implemented all the time. It\u0027s difficult to say exactly where these developments will lead the technology and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Supporters of blockchain are likely to find this incredibly exciting; from their perspective, we are living in a moment with an epochal technology that is continuing to grow and unfold.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "IOTA\u0027s blockless ledger Tangle wants to position itself as a viable alternative to Ethereum\u0027s blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "The blockchain craze continues unabated as more companies create new applications faster than ever. The architecture made popular by bitcoin and its contemporaries has proven to be a useful tool that offers better security and transparency, leading to its growing adoption in several industries thanks to its effective communications and public ledger.\n\nEven so, blockchain’s meteoric rise has not been without speed bumps, and there have been instances where it has shown weaknesses that could prove to be major challenges down the road.\n\nIn an industry such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain’s capabilities have proven to be a particularly strong fit. Interconnected devices require rapid and transparent verification of data, something blockchain’s ledger can handle exceptionally well. However, some have complained that blockchain’s somewhat rigid architecture makes it well-suited for robustly storing small amounts of data. This means it’s not truly scalable for things such as big data storage that has come to be synonymous with IoT.\n\nThis and other concerns led a team of developers to launch IOTA, a cryptocurrency platform designed for the demanding IoT ecosystem. With a twist on the traditional blockchain the company calls Tangle, IOTA claims to provide zero-fee transactions, as well as a unique verification process that resolves many of the scalability problems associated with bitcoin.\n\nTangle is attempting to position itself as a viable alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, which is still the gold standard for most applications built on the architecture. Regardless, new Ethereum-based solutions for IoT could render the discussion moot, offering a better way for IoT to function.\n\nStorage Versus Streaming\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention between supporters of blockchain and Tangle is the former’s capacity for data storage. IoT systems create massive amounts of data to parse and store, and most existing blockchains simply cannot handle the load. Indeed, the technology is meant to offer strong, secure storage for limited amounts of data.\n\nDetractors argue that this philosophy is incompatible with IoT design, and proffer that Tangle delivers a better solution thanks to its take on mining. With IOTA, every transaction requires the user to verify two other, random transactions, creating a tangled ledger that reduces the need for mining and theoretically removes any fees. This makes it a useful infrastructure for IoT devices that require micro and nano-transactions to process data being communicated, without raising overheads.\n\nIn this sense, Tangle architecture does exhibit notable advantages over blockchain. Transaction processing in blockchain means that much larger block sizes and volumes will take significantly longer to process as they must be completely verified to be appended to the chain.\n\nFor an IoT platform, this could represent prohibitive costs, and a lack of functionality due to longer processing times. However, some blockchain-based applications could present a third option using Ethereum’s blockchain, helping to resolve many of the system’s issues with data storage.\n\nStreamr, an application based on Ethereum, has designed a platform for IoT systems that uses live data streaming instead of storage. In the development team’s mind, storage in such technology is superfluous on an atomic level, as most devices require live data to make the best possible decisions, as opposed to outdated information.\n\nMoreover, Streamr proposes to create a marketplace that allows IoT providers to monetize their live data and create a greater incentive for interconnectedness and participation. The system even hosts a development environment designed to facilitate easy creation of IoT applications.\n\nEthereum and Tangle: Which Reigns Supreme?\n\nOn a deeper level, this IoT battle between Streamr and IOTA represents a broader clash of philosophies. On one hand, blockchain has proven to be a game-changing technology. Ethereum’s smart contracts and architecture have lead to a boom in the sector, and the democratization of information.\n\nOn the other hand, Tangle offers to virtually remove the cost of transacting and solve the mining issue thanks to its verification methodology. IOTA also claims that its verification method removes many of the centralization problems traditional mining creates. Because there is no need for miners to process blocks of transactions, there is no motivation to centralize the verification process.\n\nHowever, Ethereum backers have countered that even with Tangle’s supposedly superior design, they must still run on hardware that is not optimized for that type of process. Instead, verification could become bogged down due to existing technology’s binary nature, and lead to longer processing times down the line.\n\nMoreover, solutions like Streamr render the data conversation moot, as they remove the burden of data storage from the blockchain. Instead of handling massive amounts of data that can crash the network, live streamed data offers an immediate solution for IoT, and reduces the overall chain’s operational load. Most importantly, however, is that the existing ecosystem is already geared toward existing platforms such as Ethereum’s ERC-20. By creating applications that fit in to the wider environment, developers can reduce the development costs and compatibility issues.\n\nAn Escalating Race\n\nDespite blockchain’s popularity, new solutions are constantly emerging that could threaten its recent darling status in the technology world. While Ethereum has in many ways solidified its staying power and remains the most popular development environment for blockchain-based applications, Tangle is an intriguing competitor.\n\nIOTA’s architecture is still young, and while it has made promising steps towards broader adoption, the newer upstart must still contend with Ethereum’s existing infrastructure and first-mover advantage. Additionally, companies that build on Ethereum remain ahead, as they are already compatible with the prevailing systems. With the introduction of live-data streaming capabilities from companies like Streamr, Tangle may face an uphill battle dethroning Ethereum in the IoT sphere, even when considering its custom-built design.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blocks are files that permanently record cryptocurrency transaction data; once written, they cannot be altered or removed.\n\nA block is a file where information is stored and encrypted. Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information. Blocks and the information within them must be verified by a network before new blocks can be created. Blocks and blockchains are not used solely by cryptocurrencies. They also have many other uses.\n\nSolving for the hash under the proof-of-work protocol is what takes so much energy and computational power. Proof-of-work blockchains adjust mining difficulty based on how fast the network can hash. The Bitcoin network has so much hashing power, and the difficulty is so high it hashes at about 600 exahashes (quintillion, or 18 zeros) per second, and takes about 10 minutes to solve the Bitcoin hashing puzzle.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Block (Blockchain Block)?\n\nBlocks are files stored by a blockchain, where transaction data are permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is closed. Then, a new block is created for new transactions to be entered into and validated.\n\nA block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed without changing all preceding or following blocks.\n\nHow a Block (Blockchain Block) Works\n\nA blockchain network witnesses a great deal of transaction activity. The transactions made during a period are recorded into a file called a block, which is the basis of the blockchain network.\n\nA block stores information. There are many pieces of information included within a block, but it doesn\u0027t occupy a large amount of storage space. Blocks generally include these elements, but it might vary between different types. For example, Bitcoin block structures include:The transaction element is the largest because it contains the most information. It is followed in storage size by the block header, which includes these sub-elements:One 32-bit (four bytes) number in the header is called a nonce (number used once). The nonce is increased with every guess by a value of one. In Bitcoin\u0027s case, the nonce can only go up to a value of about 4 billion before it rolls over to zero again (which takes less than one second). Once this happens, another value called the extra nonce is changed, and the nonce starts over again at zero.\n\nOnce the right combination of block data, nonce, and extra nonce are found, the miner wins the competition. The network closes that block, generates a new one with a header, and the process repeats.\n\nDifferent mechanisms are used to reach a consensus; the most popular for cryptocurrency is proof-of-work (PoW), with proof-of-stake (PoS) becoming more so because of the reduced energy consumption compared to PoW.\n\nThe XRP Ledger uses a mechanism similar to proof-of-history (PoH), where a deterministic transactional ordering algorithm prevents double-spending.\n\nMining\u0027s Relationship to Blocks\n\nMining is the term used for solving the cryptographic puzzle, which acts as the first verification for transactions and proof that work was done to do the verification.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is commonly thought to be solving a complex mathematical problem; mining is actually sending block data through a hashing algorithm (which uses complicated math functions) to generate a hexadecimal number.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin uses the hashing algorithm SHA-256. For a miner to generate the \"winning\" number, the mining program sends the block header, nonce, and the extra nonce through SHA-256. The two nonces are adjusted incrementally until a certain value is reached. This value is another hexadecimal number that requires the network to spend about 10 minutes generating hashes.\n\nOther Block and Blockchain Uses\n\nBecause most blockchain definitions refer to Bitcoin because it was the first cryptocurrency to use one, many people associate blocks and blockchains with Bitcoin. However, other cryptocurrencies use blocks and blockchains as well. It\u0027s important to note that Ethereum\u0027s network also uses blocks and blockchain.\n\nHowever, Ethereum and its blockchain were designed for multiple uses that extend to much more than cryptocurrency. For example, non-fungible tokens, smart contracts, decentralized finance applications, and more have been developed using Ethereum.\n\nBlock and Blockchain Developments\n\nCryptocurrency introduced blockchains to the mainstream, but these distributed ledgers have been under development for many years. Blocks are files that store information, so much more can be done with them than issuing a token that can be used as payment or to invest in.\n\nBlocks and blockchains create unchangeable records. Public blockchains can be widely distributed and nearly impossible to alter, while private blockchains can be secured using accounts and permissions. Permissioned public blockchains are a combination of public and private blockchains. These three types set the stage for what some believe to be the next iteration of the way information and content are stored, accessed, controlled, and secured.\n\nThe backbone of the modern world is connectivity and the internet. Information and content are hosted and stored on centralized servers controlled by businesses and governments. This allows them to censor what you are exposed to, monetize (or demonetize) any content you create, track your spending and viewing habits, set restrictions on what you can and can\u0027t do, and much more.\n\nBlockchain developers are developing systems designed to replace the structure of the web. This emerging structure is commonly called Web 3. Web 3 is a concept that combines tokens, wallets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains to overhaul the web\u0027s infrastructure and transition ownership of digital content and assets back to creators.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Individuals\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of blockchains on individuals is access to financial services. Even in developed countries, some people do not have access to personal or business loans, credit, or other financial instruments that could help them achieve financial independence and stability.\n\nAnother important expectation for blockchain and Web 3 development is that they will allow you to control how your personal information is used. Information such as your age, income, what you watch, and what you\u0027re shopping for is valuable to businesses. Businesses pay other companies for your information so that they can market specifically to you and others who share your interests.\n\nIf you controlled your information using tokens, you could sell it to a business and make money from it rather than someone else using your information to earn revenue. Even better, imagine placing only the information you want businesses to have in a smart contract. If an entity wanted it, they would have to pay you for it using cryptocurrency. The blockchain would release it, you\u0027d be paid, and the smart contract could keep the business from reselling it to another company without your permission.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Businesses\n\nBusinesses in all sectors are exploring ways to use blockchains. Insurance companies can use it to facilitate insurance claims and fraud investigations, and the legal industry can use it to reduce time and costs.\n\nIntellectual property rights have always been an issue, with thefts, piracy, and fraud costing billions of dollars. Creators, media, and entertainment providers can tokenize and track content to protect their interests.\n\nFinancial service providers can have access to more individuals. Businesses can use blockchain to accurately and automatically record data, trusting that it cannot be altered by anyone. Data in these cases would be more transparent and actionable, allowing businesses to make more informed and strategic decisions.\n\nMany international businesses use blockchain solutions to make faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Using blockchain and cryptocurrency can reduce overall costs for enterprises, which can translate into lower costs for consumers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are files containing data and information about transactions and previous blocks. They are encrypted, proposed, and stored using various methods, but they are the basis for every blockchain.\n\nBlocks and blockchains are most commonly associated with cryptocurrency, but their eventual, hypothetical, and emerging uses in the world economy are what make them more interesting, especially for investors.\n\n",

The company then resubmitted an application on February 26, only a few days before Hong Kong’s February 29 deadline for crypto exchanges hoping to operate legally in the city.\n\nHuobi HK has not publicly disclosed the reason for its latest withdrawal, or whether it was instructed by the SFC to do so. In either case, HBGL must cease operating its exchange in the city within three months.\n\nUnder Hong Kong’s new virtual asset regime, the SFC may send a notice to a firm if it does not qualify for a so-called deeming arrangement, in which the platform is deemed to be licensed from June 1 while it awaits full approval for a licence. Businesses that fail to qualify are required to shut down by May 31 or within three months of being notified by the SFC, whichever is later.\n\nHBGL did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nHTX, founded in Beijing in 2013, is the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume, according to data from market tracker CoinGecko.\n\nHTX first announced its plans to pursue a licence in Hong Kong in February last year through a statement its adviser Justin Sun posted on Twitter, now X.\n\nThe company has since declared publicly that HBGL, which was pursuing the licence for Huobi HK, is “independently managed and operated” and is not involved in HTX’s management and operation.\n\nHTX is the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange started in mainland China to be thwarted in its bid to obtain a Hong Kong licence under a new scheme that has proven to be costly and have onerous compliance requirements.\n\nHKVAEX, which the Post reported last year is a local firm backed by the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, also withdrew its Hong Kong licence application last month.

    "content": "Police in China’s northeastern Jilin province have arrested six people in connection with a money-laundering case involving the movement of 2.14 billion yuan (US$296 million) in cryptocurrency to South Korea.\n\nJin and Shen, the surnames of two suspects, allegedly carried out an illegal currency exchange business, according to a statement issued by police in the city of Panshi, the state-run China News Service reported on Friday.\n\nSome people were defrauded out of their money, according to police, who did not identify which cryptocurrencies were used in the scheme.\n\nLaw enforcement became aware of the scheme when bank accounts under the suspects’ names showed “large [daily] transactions” involving a “large number of customers”. The activity had the characteristics of an illegal underground bank, according to police.\n\nPolice said the criminal group used mainland China bank accounts to receive funds, which were then used to buy cryptocurrency at over-the-counter exchanges. The crypto could then be used to facilitate foreign money exchange for cross-border business, such as e-commerce firms and other import and export businesses.\n\nMainland China maintains a strict ban on commercial cryptocurrency activity, as Beijing has long regarded it as a threat to financial stability. The central government also has strict foreign exchange controls over capital flight concerns.\n\nIn 2021, the People’s Bank of China warned that crypto firms facilitating trading activity in China were breaking the law. The government also initiated a sweeping campaign that year to push bitcoin mining out of the country.\n\nMany companies in the industry have since moved much of their remaining operations out of mainland China. Exchanges also ostensibly stopped serving mainland users, although some like Binance have maintained easy workarounds that are widely shared online.\n\nWith the crypto trade among private individuals remaining a legal grey area, mainland China saw US$86.4 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions from July 2022 to June 2023 – most of which took place through over-the-counter channels or grey market, peer-to-peer services, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has increased its efforts in combating cryptocurrency-related money laundering. Last December, China’s prosecutors and forex regulators released a statement pledging to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal foreign exchange trading, with a particular focus on cases involving Tether.\n\nThe government is also seeking to revise its Anti-Money-Laundering Law to address risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nThe revised draft was under review in late April by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislative body when the full congress is not in session.\n\nIn 2022, police in the northern Inner Mongolia autonomous region arrested 63 individuals in connection with the laundering of 12 billion yuan through the use of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the overall volume of money in crypto-related money laundering cases has recently decreased. Illicit addresses sent US$22.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2023, a 29 per cent decline from the US$31.5 billion sent in 2022, according to Chainalysis. “Both legitimate and illicit” trading activity saw an “overall decrease” in that period, the firm said.\n\n",

Savvy investors were making hundreds of millions of dollars, and it seemed like art – particularly digital art – was more lucrative than ever.\n\nMore importantly, the blockchain technology that allowed buyers to irrefutably own said artworks was set to revolutionise the art business. Artists could now sell their work directly in open marketplaces, and investors could buy and sell pieces instantly, without the need to travel to art galleries, work through an intermediary or find storage space for their collections.\n\n\n\nBuying, selling and investing in art was suddenly easier and more accessible than it had ever been.\n\nThis phenomenon was supposed to thrive regardless of how well the cryptocurrency market was doing. After all, theoretically, if the price of the cryptocurrency used to buy an NFT dropped, it would mean you’d be buying the art at a discount.\n\nInstead, what we saw during the crypto crash of 2022 was that NFTs were hit even harder. Top NFT projects like “Bored Ape Yacht Club”, which during its peak had every piece selling for tens of thousands of US dollars, saw valuations drop by over 90 per cent. The crash led to speculation that NFT mania was never about the art at all, despite what a lot of Web3 enthusiasts wanted to believe. It was about the hype. So where did it all go wrong?\n\n“Arthur Hayes [co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMex] wrote an article stating that during the crypto bubble, people didn’t make money on the implementation of projects: they made their big 100-times returns based on speculation,” said Dr Patrice Poujol, who launched a Web3 film company, the Lumiere Project, in 2019. “NFTs didn’t quite work because investors didn’t perceive the value that producers thought was there, and prices came crashing back down to Earth.”\n\n\n\nPoujol, who received the first-ever PhD in Hong Kong on Web3 and creative industries at City University of Hong Kong, is a big believer in Web3 technology and the potential of NFTs to create more vibrant ecosystems in all forms of art – from film and music, to digital art and paintings. However, he adds, implementation has been stifled by corporate greed and oversaturation.\n\n“The problem is that these technologies have been reappropriated by businessmen to, instead of helping the artist, squeeze them out of the game,” he explained. “If you look at NFTs, it started out really interestingly with artists like Beeple becoming massive successes, and we started to think, ‘Wow, this is going to allow artists to become millionaires.’ But what we saw within months, not even years, was that art became an auto-generated aesthetic that pushed the artist out of the project.”\n\nThe rise of NFTs coincided with the first editions of AI art, which allowed artists to create pieces within a matter of minutes. This led to the oversaturation of NFT marketplaces. Additionally, with the exception of a few creative artists like Beeple, the most successful NFT projects were those with appealing branding and prestige.\n\n\n\nAn obvious example of this is the aforementioned “Bored Ape Yacht Club”. It mass-produced JPEGs of the exact same ape in different outfits and colour schemes. It’s hard to argue that these easily reproducible two-dimensional sprites became worth up to US$3.4 million by being at the absolute cutting edge of creative digital artistry.\n\n“My question is – when it comes to Bored Apes, CryptoPunks and all the big projects that came out: how many artists came out of this besides a select few? The answer is: there’s hardly anyone,” Poujol said. “There should be an encyclopaedia of artists, but that’s not the case,” he added, noting that in many cases, the artists themselves were not well rewarded for their work, while the companies producing the NFTs were.\n\n“Grand promises that NFTs would put artists at the centre of the structured gain all disappeared,” he continued. “Apart from established artists, it was really difficult for emerging ones with no followers. It’s now a long shot, and what we saw with NFTs was actually a reappropriation of art for monetary purposes.”\n\n\n\nPoujol thinks that the increased sophistication of AI art has led to a digital-art NFT marketplace akin to a “Netflix on steroids”. With this level of oversaturation, it’s hard for an artist to stand out and find their own voice.\n\nBut with art becoming increasingly generic and uniform, Poujol thinks there is an opportunity for artists who make an effort to show the human element in their art.\n\nHe is still optimistic about NFTs and Web3 technology. In fact, they form a major part of Lumiere. For example, someone can purchase an NFT and use it to influence a decision in film production – say, over what type of shirt the lead actor wears in a certain scene.\n\n“This is what you can sell as an NFT, and this is the potential it has as a technology for the art world – not just a picture of a random celebrity, or a JPEG of apes, but real access and real experiences,” said Poujol.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the crypto crash got rid of a lot of the scammers and hype trains. What remains are real projects and real artists in it for the long-run. What’s more, as the market matures, there will hopefully be more deserving, hard-working artists who get the recognition and money they deserve.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen an incredible rally over the past few months, with bitcoin hitting an all-time high of US$73,800 in mid-March. If another major crypto bull run begins, could we see a resurgence of NFTs? If so, what will the new marketplace look like? Will prices be less volatile? Will valuations be based more on artistic merit than hype and status?\n\nThe answers to these questions remain to be seen, and it will be interesting to find out over the coming months.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong’s largest commercial bank, HSBC, plans to expand its line-up of tokenised assets so its customers can enjoy the benefits of such digital products, but will make sure these offerings are grounded in reality, according to the bank’s CEO. It intends to steer away from volatile cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Tokenisation is a more efficient trading mechanism and provides liquidity to that asset,” Noel Quinn said during a private media round table in Hong Kong last week. “In theory, you can tokenise anything. The key criteria for me is, is there substance behind the token? Has it got predictability? Does it exist?”\n\nHis comments came shortly after the launch of HSBC’s Gold Token, the first such retail product to be issued by a bank in Hong Kong, as the government pushes for the roll-out of more digital assets to the public.\n\nTokenised products can be recorded digitally on a blockchain, offered directly to end-investors, distributed by intermediaries, or traded. They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\n\n\nAccording to Quinn, tokenisation has shown to be cheaper, more efficient and better than “the old-fashioned way of trading”. There are more applications of tokenisation that the bank wants to explore.\n\n“We continue to invest in our tokenisation product line-up. I think tokenisation of gold and bond issues are good [examples],” he said. “I’m very comfortable with the concept of tokenisation.”\n\nWhile not mentioning specifics, Quinn said the bank will look at ways to tokenise assets that are “backed by something real”.\n\n\n\nGold and bonds are “a real asset”, whereas a cryptocurrency may be based on similar technology, but is more volatile and unpredictable. HSBC would be “staying away from crypto”, Quinn said.\n\nSpeaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit last week, the city’s regulators were confident Hong Kong will be a world leader in tokenisation. Part of its efforts is the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nWhile still in its early days, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the second phase of a pilot programme in March to explore use cases for a CBDC. Some of the use cases tested so far include online payments, payments in shops, the collection of government payouts, tokenised deposits, tokenised asset settlement and Web3 trading and clearing.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong government completed the world’s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million last month. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion’s private blockchain as part of the HKMA’s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduces the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and makes secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n“People are increasingly engaging in conversations about digital assets, and tokenised gold is one kind of asset that can be as liquid as conventional assets,” John O’Neill, the bank’s global head of digital assets strategy, said at the bank’s summit last week.\n\n",

They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the SFC.\n\n“Asset tokenisation can enable convenient, affordable and broad access to real-world and financial assets, in this case, the HSBC Gold Token,” said Sami Abouzahr, Hong Kong head of investments and wealth solutions at HSBC.\n\nHSBC Gold Token is the first of a series of planned retail products that will use HSBC Orion.\n\nPreviously, the platform helped to tokenise physical gold in London for institutional investors and launch digital green bonds in Hong Kong.\n\nLast month, the Hong Kong government completed the world’s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion’s private blockchain as part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduced the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and made secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n“Investors had the option to follow largely business-as-usual processes through traditional market infrastructure, i.e. the CMU in Hong Kong and its external linkages with [clearing houses],” Darryl Chan, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, said at an event staged by the International Capital Market Association in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\n\n“This has significantly broadened the bond’s investor base and enhanced its liquidity. It is fair to say that the issuance brought tokenised bonds further beyond proof-of-concept, towards achieving more common applications.”\n\nAt Tuesday’s Milken Institute Global Investors’ Symposium, HSBC Hong Kong’s chief digital officer Bojan Obradović said the blockchain ledger has “strong potential to be a mainstream component of future financial markets”.\n\nHSBC is focusing on investing in distributed ledger technology, identifying which assets to develop as digital products, be it funds and bonds, tokens representing real-world assets or digital money, according to Obradović.\n\nAs well as working with the HKMA on its proposed central bank digital currency at the retail and wholesale levels, the lender is creating its own tokenised deposits and researching stablecoins.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is formulating a regulatory regime to sell stablecoins to retail investors. Stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets issued by private entities against a portfolio of traditional financial assets.\n\nObradović praised the government’s efforts to develop the sector.\n\n“Hong Kong has got a real opportunity to become the world’s leading digital asset hub,” he said.\n\n“How we get the buy and sell-side to come to Hong Kong and get real transactions to take place and have real economic value will be key.”\n\n",

    "summary": "The Securities and Futures Commission has warned of a fraudulent crypto trading platform called Quantum AI, a long-time scam that uses deepfakes of Elon Musk.\n\n",
    "content": "Last week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned of a scam using deepfakes of Elon Musk touting a cryptocurrency trading platform called “Quantum AI”. The scam is old, but it highlights an alarming rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud – and Asia has proven particularly susceptible.\n\nIn its public warning on May 8, the SFC said that Quantum AI makes claims of being able to earn “too-good-to-be-true” returns and the regulator made a request to the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to related websites and social media pages. The linked domains were inaccessible as of this week, and the Facebook groups appear to have been removed.\n\nThere have already been multiple cases of deepfake-related incidents of fraud in Hong Kong, putting the government on alert. Deepfake incidents in Asia-Pacific surged 1,530 per cent last year, with Vietnam and Japan seeing the most attacks, according to a report from identity verification platform Sumsub.\n\n“Thanks to increasing digital financial transactions in the emerging Asia market, there is a larger pool for deepfake targets,” said Penny Chai, Sumsub’s vice-president of business development in APAC. “Since a high volume of instant cross-border transactions takes place in the region, especially in Hong Kong, deepfake scammers can leverage the complexity and volume of financial dealings to carry out fraudulent activities.”\n\nThe Quantum AI scam dates back at least a year, although it seems to be recycled with different variations used to target different groups.\n\nOne video spread on Facebook last year, debunked by PolitiFact, featured Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, alongside Jack Ma – co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post – promoting the platform. It was modified from a video of Musk and Ma appearing together at the 2019 World AI Conference in Shanghai.\n\nAnother video was modified from an appearance Musk made on the Fox News show of conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, according to Reuters Fact Check.\n\nSome of the domains using the scheme rely on cheap hosting providers and flexible back-end technologies like WordPress. One of the top search results for Quantum AI is a website saying it requires a US$250 minimum deposit, accompanied by a warning that users should “invest only what you’re okay with losing completely”.\n\nIncidents of fraud using deepfakes – convincing simulacra of real people using generative AI – are on the rise. Sumsub – which tracks incidents of identity fraud, including through the use of deepfakes – detected a tenfold increase in the use of deepfakes last year, according to its Identity Fraud report.\n\nSumsub identified Hong Kong as one of the top five markets in Asia for identity fraud at a rate of 3.3 per cent last year. Bangladesh had the highest at 5.4 per cent.\n\nIn the first quarter, fintech industry fraud in Hong Kong grew at a rate of 3.8 per cent, which was 216 per cent faster than the rate in the same period a year earlier, Sumsub told the Post.\n\nDeepfakes have already caused tens of millions of dollars in losses in the city.\n\nIn 2020, a manager at a Japanese bank was fooled by fake audio mimicking his director’s voice into transferring US$35 million. Another multinational company lost US$25.6 million to a fraud involving a deepfake video call mimicking the likeness of the chief financial officer.\n\nThe SFC has become increasingly hawkish in flagging crypto-related scams on its website. Of the 29 suspicious virtual asset trading platforms listed by the SFC, 18 of the warnings were issued this year, and 24 of them were issued since JPEX scandal last September.\n\nThat incident tied the JPEX cryptocurrency exchange to the loss of roughly HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million), making it one of the largest financial frauds in the city’s history.\n\nThe regulator has also been more active in flagging other suspicious crypto-related products. On Monday, it warned of an investment product called LENA Network that involves cryptocurrency staking, borrowing and lending arrangements.\n\nArrangements for staking, which requires locking up a certain amount of crypto to validate transactions on a blockchain, could “amount to unauthorised collective investment schemes”, the SFC warned, and “may be highly risky”.\n\n",

    "content": "Canaan, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency-mining equipment maker, has unveiled in Hong Kong an energy-saving machine designed to help miners stay competitive after the rewards for mining bitcoin were reduced by 50 per cent after the recent “halving” event.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed company launched the latest A1566 model of its flagship Avalon A15 series on Thursday at the Bitcoin Asia 2024 conference. The debut of the new mining rigs came weeks after bitcoin’s fourth halving event.\n\nOccuring roughly every four years, halving is an algorithmic instruction built into the bitcoin blockchain to manage the cryptocurrency’s supply and maintain its scarcity.\n\nThe latest halving event, which occurred on April 19, slashed the amount of bitcoin that miners receive for operating the powerful computers that verify transactions on the blockchain. That means older computers that are less energy-efficient will need to spend more on electricity to obtain the same quantity of bitcoin as before.\n\n“The bitcoin halving is a challenge, but also an opportunity, ” said Davis Hui, vice-president at Canaan, in an interview with the Post.\n\nAs halving reduces the supply of new bitcoin, halving events have historically triggered a sharp rise in the cryptocurrency’s price. The past three halvings – in 2020, 2016 and 2012 – resulted in an average price increase of 16 per cent over the following 60 days, according to 10x Research, a digital asset consultancy.\n\n“That’s why we chose this timing to launch our new bitcoin-mining machines to help our miners get through this time’s halving,” Hui said. The new machine can compute more data, while consuming less energy compared to previous models, he said.\n\nDespite the latest halving event, bitcoin prices have been on a downward trend in recent weeks, as the US Federal Reserve puts off cutting interest rates.\n\nCanaan last year reported a 67.5 per cent plunge in total revenue to US$211.5 million, citing lower selling price of its equipment because of “overall soft purchasing power from the market demand front”. Mining equipment sales revenue fell 71.5 per cent to US$175.9 million, according to the company’s financial statement.\n\n“While we acknowledge the persisting challenges of the ongoing bearish market for mining machines, we draw inspiration from the recent approval and listing of spot bitcoin ETFs,” said Nangeng Zhang, chairman and CEO of Canaan.\n\nHong Kong’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the first of its kind in Asia, debuted last week, after 11 US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January following a green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFounded in 2013, Canaan has businesses in the US, Canada, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, with over 20 maintenance support sites around the world.\n\n",

    "summary": "Her brand L’Dezen was one of the first jewellery companies to incorporate NFTs, enabling customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of pieces – but these days Shah is more interested in AI\n\n",
    "content": "Payal Shah is deeply entrenched in Hong Kong’s art and tech scenes. Her jewellery company L’Dezen, founded more than 12 years ago, was one of the first to incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of her pieces.\n\nShah, who has over 115,000 followers on Instagram, has always been both artistic and tech-savvy. She is one of the most vocal voices on X posting about Web3, and was named by Tatler Asia as one of the 30 most influential women in the NFT space. Now, she’s one of the most influential female voices on artificial intelligence (AI) in Hong Kong.\n\nShe attributes much of the success of L’Dezen and her own personal brand to her dedication to following the latest tech trends. “In this competitive world, you have to find ways to grow and stay ahead of the curve,” said Shah. “If you’re constantly involved in what’s available and innovating, then all of a sudden you’re keeping your brand relevant, and that gives you a competitive edge that you’d normally need to pay millions of dollars for.”\n\n\n\nRecently, Shah’s focus has shifted away from Web3 and NFTs to AI. Though she still likes the core ideals of NFTs, namely the idea of giving ownership back to the artist without the influence of a third-party entity, she feels that things haven’t unfolded the way she had originally hoped, at least thus far.\n\n“I love the conversations and I love it from the artist’s perspective, being an artist and jeweller myself, but I don’t know if there’s going to be mainstream adoption any time soon,” she said. “The onboarding process is still too much of a hurdle for people to have a cryptocurrency wallet as easily as they’d have, say, an Apple Wallet. And because of all of the scammers in the industry, I have some artist friends who say they would never touch it.”\n\nShah now regularly hosts seminars and workshops with a focus on educating artists and entrepreneurs about how to use AI. “Research is a huge part of the design process – what the latest trends are or where they’re headed, and AI makes that process way more efficient,” she explained. “You’re creating with the idea of: yeah, I’m an artist, but I want to make sure this art converts into sales, so I need to incorporate data. So I’ll find out, how much do my potential customers spend per year on jewellery? What’s the material of the year? And so on.”\n\n\n\nAs a boot camp and training organiser at Female Entrepreneurs Worldwide, one of Shah’s main passions is educating women about AI. “I don’t want AI to be completely male dominated the way Web3 was; I really want AI to include all genders,” she explained.\n\nAnother reason Shah wants female entrepreneurs and artists to become more tech-savvy is that she thinks that AI is both more important and more transformative than Web3, especially in the art space. “If you completely ignored Web3 [during the peak mania phase], you’d still be completely fine,” she said. “But you can’t ignore AI. The phone you’re using probably uses AI. Most of the apps you use are already using AI. That’s why education, especially for women, is so important.”\n\nShah does her best to keep her workshops fun and playful, while teaching important skills like prompt engineering, data analysis, as well as going over the latest trends and developments in the space. Though Shah is an AI optimist, she understands the concerns that a lot of artists have about generative AI art and the ease with which art can be produced by AI programs; concerns about whether AI generated art is “real”; and the potential threat to the livelihood of artists who have spent years perfecting their craft.\n\n\n\nShe, like many others, is especially concerned about OpenAI’s latest project, Sora – an AI-powered, text-to-video model that will allow people to make films in a matter of minutes. “What usually requires 30 people to get on set for photoshoots and video shoots, and their whole livelihoods are based on this – a lot of it is going to get wiped out thanks to Sora, and the number of shows and films is going to be overwhelming,” Shah said.\n\nWhile she understands the sentiment that artists share, Shah added, “[AI is] not a real person: it’s just mimicking a bunch of different people’s information that’s been given, and turning that into art.” She believes that art with a human touch will be at a premium, and her advice to young and upcoming artists is to never let their art lose its human element.\n\n“You can think of the AI as a second brain,” she continued. “An amazing, high-IQ assistant, but your brain has to be involved, and you have to give the AI something human and relevant when prompting – and that will always require you to work and do your own research.”\n\n",

    "content": "FTX says that nearly all of its customers will receive the money back that they are owed, two years after the cryptocurrency exchange imploded, and some will get more than that.\n\nFTX said in a court filing on Tuesday that it owes about US$11.2 billion to its creditors. The exchange estimates that it has between US$14.5 billion and US$16.3 billion to distribute to them.\n\nThe filing said that after paying claims in full, the plan provides for supplemental interest payments to creditors, to the extent that funds still remain. The interest rate for most creditors is 9 per cent.\n\nThat may be a diminished consolation for investors who were trading cryptocurrency on the exchange when it collapsed.\n\nWhen FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, bitcoin was going for US$16,080. But cryptocurrency prices have soared as the economy recovered while the assets at FTX were sorted out over the past two years.\n\nA single bitcoin on Tuesday was selling for close to US$62,675. That comes out to a 290 per cent loss, a bit less than that if accrued interest is counted, if those investors had held onto those coins.\n\nCustomers and creditors that claim US$50,000 or less will get about 118 per cent of their claim, according to the plan, which was filed with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This covers about 98 per cent of FTX customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetising a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world when it filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.\n\nCEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned when the exchange collapsed. In March, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the massive fraud that occurred at FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy – a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 per cent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on June 25.\n\n",

    "summary": "HKVAEX is advising users to withdraw funds this month ahead of its May 1 shutdown, just three months after it submitted an application for a crypto licence.\n\n",
    "content": "The Binance-affiliated cryptocurrency exchange HKVAEX is shutting down its operations in Hong Kong after withdrawing its application for a licence in the city, ending a bid that lasted just three months.\n\nIn the company’s official group chat on the messaging platform Telegram, HKVAEX head of operations Walton Chan announced the closure and said users should withdraw their assets by April 30. The website will shut down on May 1, the company said its official announcement, and trading services will end on April 5. Deposits and new user registrations have already been suspended.\n\nThe exchange is winding down operations less than two months after former CEO Stanley Fung left the company. Fung said he is “not privy to the details surrounding their recent decision”. He did not say why he decided to leave the company.\n\nHKVAEX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe closure comes just over a year since the company launched its virtual asset trading platform (VATP) in February 2023, securing its position as a pre-existing service provider so that it would have a one-year window to apply for a licence after a new regulation from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took effect in June. The exchange submitted its application in January, well ahead of the February 29 deadline, but the SFC’s website shows that it was withdrawn on March 28.\n\nThe company’s ties to Binance have raised questions about whether it would be able to successfully secure a licence, especially after the crypto giant was found guilty of breaking US anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nThe Post reported last October that Binance was behind HKVAEX, which was set up as a separate entity in Hong Kong and shares digital resources with the world’s largest crypto exchange. Binance has said that HKVAEX is “not in the Binance Group of companies”.\n\nIts retreat from the market leaves Binance as the only major crypto player founded in China that does not have an affiliate or subsidiary pursuing a VATP licence in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong entity under OKX submitted an application last November and Huobi HK, under HBGL Hong Kong, submitted in February.\n\nHTX, formerly Huobi, said Huobi HK operates independently. Before taking over as head of HKVAEX, Fung was CEO of Huobi HK.\n\nHKVAEX did not give a reason for deciding to shut down before the SFC’s application process had concluded. Beyond its ties to Binance, though, VATP operators have expressed concerns about the high compliance costs for getting a licence in Hong Kong, in addition to requirements such as cold storage reserves that are even greater than what is required in neighbouring markets like Singapore.\n\nStill, Fung said he remains “highly optimistic” about the city’s Web3 industry. “I continue to see Hong Kong as a future hub for these technologies and I’m excited about the opportunities this presents,” he said.\n\n",

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are eating into Binance’s share of bitcoin trading outside the US as overseas expansion efforts and changing regulations reshape the competitive dynamics of the digital-asset industry.\n\nOver the past year, the world’s largest crypto exchange saw its share of such bitcoin trading drop to 55.3 per cent from 81.3 per cent, according to research firm Kaiko. For smaller tokens known as altcoins, the proportion fell to 50.5 per cent from 58 per cent.\n\nKaiko pegged the changes to Binance’s decision to end a promotion that scrapped trading fees. “Offshore markets have become less concentrated, with smaller exchanges gaining momentum as trade volumes recovered,” the company’s analysts wrote in a note.\n\nPlatforms like Bybit and OKX have expanded their footprints in regions such as Asia, while Binance has been grappling with the fallout of legal issues. The company and its co-founder Zhao Changpeng pleaded guilty to US anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations in November last year.\n\nBybit’s share of non-US bitcoin trading reached 9.3 per cent over the past year, up from 2 per cent, according to Kaiko. OKX accounts for 7.3 per cent currently, up from 3 per cent.\n\nBinance has been trying to rebuild its reputation while operating under the watchful gaze of US regulators. Under new boss Richard Teng – a former regulator in Singapore – the exchange has tightened token listing rules and appointed a board of directors.\n\nThe digital-asset industry as a whole has benefited from a fourfold jump in the bitcoin price since the start of last year. The rebound from a 2022 rout took the token to a record high of US$73,798 last month, catalysing trading volumes.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Vitalik Buterin made a rare last-minute appearance at Hong Kong’s biggest Web3 event for a 20 minute technical talk on blockchain tech.\n\n",
    "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, made a rare last-minute appearance at a Hong Kong crypto conference on Tuesday, despite previously expressing scepticism about the city’s commitment to supporting the industry.\n\nButerin gave two keynote speeches at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Tuesday, the final day of the four-day event, focusing on blockchain technology. His in-person attendance came as a surprise to many, as it was only announced by the conference on Monday evening.\n\nThe entrepreneur, regarded as a major figure in crypto communities because of his influence over one of the world’s most widely used blockchains, last year cautioned industry players about setting up shop in Hong Kong, suggesting the stability of the city’s new-found support for virtual assets as of the end of 2022 could be fickle.\n\n\n\n“Obviously it’s very friendly now,” Buterin said at the Web3 Transitions Summit in Singapore in September 2023. “But the big question I’m asking, and I think [everyone] is asking, is how stable is the level of friendliness.”\n\nHe added that if a crypto project wants to make Hong Kong their home, it would need to be confident that the city will continue to be friendly to the sector many years from now, “when all kinds of unknown, regulatory and political events are going to happen”.\n\nButerin acknowledged at the time that he does not “understand Hong Kong well”, and even less the “complicated interaction between Hong Kong and the mainland lately”.\n\nHis comments prompted a response from Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, who said on X, formerly Twitter, that “Hong Kong’s policies and laws will not change overnight”, and dismissed the idea of any complications because Beijing supports the “one country, two systems” arrangement that allows the city some policy autonomy. Commercial use of cryptocurrency is strictly banned in mainland China.\n\nNg also invited Buterin to “come to Hong Kong to understand the situation”.\n\nButerin is one of the few heavyweight speakers who attended the Hong Kong event this year, as the city increased its efforts to woo international crypto talent and businesses with the goal of becoming a virtual asset hub. The hall was completely packed with crypto faithful at an event where attendance had been patchy most days.\n\nHis talk, however, was just over 20 minutes and dealt strictly with technical upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain. He then left as quickly as he appeared, taking no questions.\n\nInvestor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, dialled in remotely on the first day of the conference. In an onstage interview with HashKey Capital, she applauded Hong Kong’s virtual asset policy initiatives and suggested that the US is lagging behind. The investor also gave a highly optimistic view of bitcoin’s future, predicting that the token will trade at US$1.5 million by 2030.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino’s new venture Holepunch has launched a peer-to-peer messaging app called Keet to aid the mission of ‘financial freedom’.\n\n",
    "content": "The CEO of Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, is developing a new peer-to-peer technology that he hopes will further wrest financial control from big institutions, and the cryptocurrency giant he heads is pouring millions of dollars into it.\n\nTether intends to invest tens of millions of dollars into a new peer-to-peer chat and video conferencing app called Keet to make it “one of three most known communication applications in the world”, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and co-founder of Keet developer Holepunch, told the Post in an interview.\n\nBuilt on a new peer-to-peer protocol called Pear Runtime, which Holepunch launched two months ago, the absence of any middleman or centralised server aligns with the ethos of Tether and Ardoino, who said he seeks to offer greater financial freedom.\n\n“[At Tether] we are bitcoiners at heart. We believe in the bitcoin mission that is bringing financial freedom to the world,” Ardoino said in a chat conducted over Keet on Wednesday. “If you have financial freedom, but you don’t have freedom of speech … we are not really free, right?”\n\n\n\nTether was started in Hong Kong 10 years ago and has since transformed into a critical component of Web3, often as a main source of liquidity for other cryptocurrencies because of its peg to the US dollar. Tether still has an active corporate entity in Hong Kong, according to government records, but Ardoino said it is “dormant” and the company no longer has personnel in the city.\n\nWith Tether now the world’s default blockchain-based dollar, Ardoino sees his new venture as taking on technology giants such as Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp, and Google. As a peer-to-peer technology, Pear Runtime eliminates the need for expensive server infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on building the apps, Ardoino said.\n\nIts ability to do this hinges on the backing of Tether, which Ardoino noted made more than US$6 billion in profit last year.\n\n“We don’t care to make more money,” he said. “We are investing in … companies that are aligned with the vision of bringing freedom and creating tools that are ready for the apocalypse.”\n\nKeet, built in-house by Holepunch, is the first flagship tool using Pear Runtime. Like other peer-to-peer apps, users connect directly to other computers, so their internet protocol (IP) addresses are exposed to others in a chat room – although Keet does not directly make that information visible in the app. However, Ardoino said messages are end-to-end encrypted and traffic cannot be publicly monitored, so only the people a user chats with can see those addresses.\n\nThe company is not able to share developer statistics for the same reason, according to Holepunch CEO Mathias Buus Madsen. But there is “definitely a big percentage” coming from Asia, including India and “the Hong Kong area”, he said.\n\nThe app has already built in some cryptocurrency functionality by including a Lightning wallet. The Lightning Network is a so-called layer 2 payment protocol on the bitcoin blockchain that allows for fast and cheap transfers of small amounts of bitcoin. The Holepunch team is also working fast to integrate Tether, also known as USDT.\n\n“Bitcoin is the unstoppable money, and Keet is the unstoppable app. That’s why we thought it’s more appropriate to have bitcoin first,” Ardoino said. “Nevertheless, USDT will come probably soon, in the next few months.”\n\nAs the crypto sector rebounds from the 2022 crash, the total market value of Tether’s USDT stablecoin surpassed US$100 billion last month and now sits at about US$106 billion, according to data on CoinGecko. The total value of stablecoins in circulation stands at US$152 billion, giving Tether a nearly 70 per cent market share, according to market tracker DefiLlama.\n\nIts outsize presence in the industry has also invited increasing scrutiny in recent years and criticism of a lack of transparency about the reserves backing USDT.\n\nTether Holdings, now based in the British Virgin Islands, has traditionally revealed little information about itself. It was started by the same people behind the crypto exchange Bitfinex, where Ardoino serves as chief technology officer (CTO). Ardoino joined Bitfinex as a software developer in October 2014 and became CTO of Tether in 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nTether has been publishing quarterly attestations of its reserves, and in October the company told Bloomberg that it would start publishing data on its reserves in real time. Ardoino did not share a timeline for that when asked, but said that a full audit remains challenging because the 2022 collapse of FTX made major accounting firms more hesitant to work with major crypto firms for fear of reputational risks.\n\n“FTX didn’t make our life easier,” he said.\n\nAnother source of controversy has been the widespread use of USDT in cybercrime.\n\nArdoino slammed some of the reporting that has been done on Tether in recent years, saying the company works with the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations and Secret Service to track criminals using USDT.\n\n“You have to be a really, really stupid criminal to use Tether,” Ardoino said, pointing to the transparency of its data because it is run on a public blockchain.\n\nMembers of criminal gangs using slave labour in place like Myanmar may not fear legal repercussions in countries they will never visit. This is just one reason law enforcement agencies are concerned about the increasing use of encrypted services that hide traces of illegal activity.\n\nMeanwhile, financial regulators have raised concerns about the impact of stablecoins on financial stability owing to issues such as capital flight. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced stablecoin regulations for public consultation in December that would require issuers to get licensed.\n\nTether is also “following the development of regulations” in Hong Kong, Ardoino said, adding that it is in discussions with local firms to explore ways to engage the Hong Kong market.\n\nAsked if he thinks an app like Keet could accelerate illegal money flows or impact financial stability, Ardoino demurred.\n\n“USDT helps the last mile. Those are the people [whose] entire wealth is US$100 and they don’t have a bank account,” he said. “Bankers don’t care about us.”\n\nStill, Ardoino made it clear that there is an ideological component underpinning the new P2P protocol. He pointed to a quote by the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s second Batman film The Dark Knight that “reflects well” the mission of Keet.\n\n“It’s not about money; it’s about sending a message.”\n\n",

They are accused of carrying out the lightning-fast heist, plotted over the course of months, from their keyboards last year.\n\n“The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialised skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.\n\nThe two studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with Anton graduating in February with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and math and James graduating with a Master of Science in aeronautics and astronautics in 2021.\n\nLawyers for the Peraire-Bueno brothers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The brothers, who were arrested Tuesday in Boston and New York.\n\nThe US Justice Department has been focused on stamping out fraud and misconduct in the cryptocurrency industry, winning convictions of several high-profile industry executives, most notably Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, who also went to MIT.\n\nEthereum is known as the biggest commercial highway in cryptocurrency, used by thousands of apps and focused on everything from finance to gaming.\n\nThe US says the brothers set up something called validators, which are designed to help order transactions on the Ethereum network and to help bots make money by facilitating arbitrage and other profitable trades.\n\nInstead, they put their own validators in place to deceive the traders operating the bots, according to prosecutors.\n\nThey secured access to pending transactions and altered the movement of electronic currency to steal the cryptocurrency, the government alleges. The pair then moved the cryptocurrency through a web of transactions in an attempt to hide the source of the funds, according to the US.\n\nThe two allegedly spent months planning the heist, including studying the trading behaviours of Ethereum bots and setting up shell companies to operate behind.\n\nThey searched online for cryptocurrency exchanges with limited “know your customer” procedures they could use to launder their ill-gotten gains and even researched extradition procedures, prosecutors say.\n\n",

    "content": "A close aide of a Dubai prince who suddenly postponed the opening ceremony of his Hong Kong family office has a history of unsuccessful blockchain ventures and was involved in a solar plant deal in the United States that collapsed due to a lack of funding, public records show.\n\nSheikh Ali Rashed Ali Saeed Al Maktoum, reportedly the nephew of Dubai’s ruler and prime minister, grabbed headlines earlier this month when he pledged to open a US$500 million family office in Hong Kong and made appearances at high-profile events in the city over the past week.\n\nBut he unexpectedly pushed back the opening ceremony of the office by two months and questions have swirled about his business track record and connections to the ruling family.\n\nScrutiny has now fallen on his close aides, including the office’s director of international strategic relations William Tien, also known as Tien Chwan Hoa.\n\nTien was involved in the blockchain-based digital wallet TiENPAY that folded and was a director of a company tied to a solar plant deal in Arizona that imploded when a newspaper exposé revealed the backers could not provide the financing.\n\nIn explaining Thursday’s postponement of the launch ceremony of Maktoum’s family office at the eleventh hour, his private office pointed to “some urgent matters in Dubai that needed his attention”.\n\n“It has been confirmed that the operation of the sheikh’s family office in Hong Kong will proceed as planned,” the office said on Friday evening. “It is merely the inauguration ceremony that has been planned will now be postponed until Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum comes [to] town again at the end of May.”\n\nMaktoum also expressed his “sincere gratitude” to the Hong Kong government, including the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and InvestHK, for their help in establishing his office in the city, and apologised for any inconvenience caused.\n\nThe statement did not elaborate on the urgent matters that led to the abrupt delay and did not address the prince’s business experience or family ties.\n\n\n\nThe private office’s website was created less than a year ago, with the domain name registered on May 29, 2023, through Domains by Proxy, according to whois records.\n\nCommunications with the press have been managed by Eleanor Jane Mak, vice-chairman and CEO of the prince’s family office. She remains a director of China New Energy Skyrail International and nine other locally registered companies.\n\nRepresentatives of the prince’s office, according to the Friday evening statement, have been in contact with China New Energy Skyrail, which has previously advanced a monorail project for the Kai Tak development area in Hong Kong. The office said its staff had visited Beijing, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou and Chengdu in mainland China to explore opportunities.\n\nWilliam Tien was the representative who signed a cooperation deal with the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong on behalf of the office on Tuesday.\n\nThe entrepreneur, who identifies himself as the president and CEO of the US-based Axis Technologies Group on his LinkedIn account, is no stranger to setting up businesses in Hong Kong, holding directorships in at least seven locally registered companies under the name “Tien Chwan Hoa”.\n\nTien was a director of TiENPAY, which was dissolved last year. TiENPAY labelled itself a software developer involved in mobile wallet and blockchain projects, as well as the crypto-to-crypto digital exchange T8EX. The TiENPAY website is no longer accessible.\n\nTiENPAY was previously known as Zentric (HK) and had entered into an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Matinee Energy to build solar power plants in Benson, Arizona, in January of 2012, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission made that year.\n\n\n\nThe solar project later ran into trouble and Zentric’s lack of a track record in the field was exposed in a bombshell report by the Phoenix New Times, which described the two US-based companies headed by Tien at the time – including Alpha Lujo – as “broke”.\n\nZentric reportedly pulled out of the project “just before press time” after the Arizona newspaper made email inquiries, with Tien claiming in a letter that his firm was “unable to arrange for sufficient financing” to meet the project’s deadlines.\n\nContractors of the project have since launched legal battles against executives of Matinee Energy demanding compensation, which Zentric and Tien were not involved in.\n\nOne of Tien’s newest ventures is Asian Carbon Holdings, which was incorporated last October, two months before the prince’s previous visit to Hong Kong. Tien had touted his experience in green sectors when being interviewed as chairman of Asian Carbon Holdings last December.\n\n“I started working on carbon capture and storage projects in 2009, and it has become more and more common in the past few years. They call it carbon neutralisation in China. So we have rich experience in this industry,” he told a broadcaster at an event that the prince attended as well.\n\nIn the interview he suggested a project to facilitate carbon credit trading through blockchain tokenisation of real-world assets. The idea seemed to align with a plan of Maktoum’s office to focus on “sustainable business ties between the UAE and Asia”.\n\nTien is a Singaporean passport holder with a correspondence address at a residential block at a housing estate in the city state, according to a new filing made this month for a Hong Kong company called Space Node Lab.\n\nHe listed a pair of US and Singapore mobile numbers on his business card for his role in the prince’s family office, though the former could not be reached and the latter was not in use. The Post has reached out to Tien by email.\n\nThe Dubai prince’s ambitious investment plan attracted considerable attention and interest from mainland Chinese enterprises, but some raised concerns after finding scarce public information about him.\n\n\n\nQuestions about Maktoum’s relationship with the prime minister were also raised by academics who study the history of the royal families of the Gulf states.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the royals said Maktoum was from a “distant branch” of the ruling family. The UAE consulate earlier confirmed that Maktoum was “from the ruling family” and “a sheikh” – an honorific title designating a royal family member.\n\nIn the first statement issued on Friday, Maktoum’s office also painted the 28-year-old as a “visionary leader and patriot of cultural arts dedicated to fostering positive changes that extend beyond the borders of Dubai” and highlighted his recent appointment as an honorary professor in sustainability leadership at Hang Seng University.\n\n“Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum believes that the opening of his family office in Hong Kong is just the start of his global public service,” it added.\n\nHang Seng University told the Post on Friday that the delayed opening of the office would have no impact on the operation of the Asia-Pacific Asean Green Deal Centre.\n\nThe Hong Kong government distanced itself from the matter on Thursday, saying it would not comment on the business activities of individuals.\n\nThe prince had spoken at a key family office summit in Hong Kong a day earlier, co-organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and InvestHK.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong and Shenzhen have begun to test cross-border information verification between the two cities, as they take early steps in enabling the exchange of business data across the Greater Bay Area (GBA), starting with the financial industry.\n\nThe first phase of the pilot trial will focus on the cross-border verification of credit reports by credit reference agencies and commercial banks, according to a statement published on Monday by WeBank, the Shenzhen-based virtual lender providing the technology underpinning the data-flow platform.\n\nAs China moves to build a legal and regulatory mechanism to screen data entering and leaving the mainland border, observers have warned that stringent requirements, including security assessments, could hurt Hong Kong’s role as a base for foreign investors to manage their mainland operations.\n\nThe new data-verification platform will test Beijing’s plan to keep watch on cross-border data flows without disrupting normal business operations.\n\nAs part of the trial, Shenzhen Credit Services and Nova Credit in Hong Kong will use the platform to verify corporate credit reports. Shenzhen-based Baihang Credit Services and Fusion Bank in Hong Kong will use it to verify credit information. Hong Kong’s Bank of East Asia will use the platform to conduct credit checks of customers at its mainland and Hong Kong branches.\n\nCredit verification is an important step for banks and financial institutions to assess clients, but the process has been interrupted by restrictions on cross-border data transfers between the mainland and Hong Kong.\n\nThe pilot programme, which aims to build the infrastructure needed to support cross-border digital services, will make life and work more convenient for residents, as well as companies looking to expand their businesses, according to the announcement.\n\nThe platform marks another step forward in strengthening data cooperation across the GBA, which is the Chinese government’s scheme to link Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in southern Guangdong province into an integrated economic and business hub.\n\nIn December, the Hong Kong government said it planned to launch a pilot programme for the cross-border transfer of data, covering areas such as health and banking, after the city in July agreed with the Cyberspace Administration of China on draft rules governing the safe flow of data within the GBA.\n\nBuilt on distributed data-transfer protocols and the mainland blockchain platform FISCO BCOS, the data-verification platform will conduct verifications using hash values, which are unique digital fingerprints assigned to data. The platform does not transfer or store cross-border data, according to WeBank.\n\nThe programme is expected to cover more sectors in the future, including cross-border healthcare and daily-life services, the bank said.\n\n",

    "content": "US prosecutors want Zhao Changpeng, founder and former chief executive of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to serve three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to violating laws against money laundering.\n\nProsecutors made the request in a Tuesday night filing in Seattle federal court.\n\nThey said sentencing Zhao to twice the maximum 18 months recommended under federal guidelines would reflect the magnitude of his wilful violations, and send a message that “the right choice, every time, is to comply with the law”.\n\nLawyers for Zhao requested probation. US District Judge Richard Jones is expected to sentence Zhao on April 30.\n\nOnce the most powerful figure in the crypto industry, Zhao, 47, stepped down as Binance’s chief last November, when he and the exchange admitted to evading anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nBinance agreed to a US$4.32 billion criminal penalty.\n\nProsecutors said Binance, employing a “Wild West” model that welcomed criminals, did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.\n\nThey also said Zhao’s platform supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and was a recipient of a large portion of ransomware proceeds.\n\n“He made a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract users, build his company and line his pockets,” prosecutors said.\n\nIn seeking leniency, Zhao’s lawyers cited the first-time offender’s “unflinching” acceptance of responsibility, his US$50 million criminal fine and that no defendant in a remotely similar case has been imprisoned.\n\nThey also said Zhao made Binance an industry leader on compliance, “despite the initial failures that led to this prosecution”. Zhao founded Binance in 2017.\n\nHe has been free on a US$175 million bond, and agreed not to appeal any sentence within federal guidelines.\n\n\n\nBinance’s penalty included a US$1.81 billion criminal fine and US$2.51 billion of restitution. Zhao also paid US$50 million to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, his lawyers said.\n\nThe case is US v. Zhao, US District Court, Western District of Washington, No 23-cr-00179.\n\n",

    "title": "Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs have one big attraction: no tax\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Asia could be attractive to investors looking to avoid US tax laws, but the market is still relatively ‘tiny’.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong’s upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly into cryptocurrencies could be attractive to many Asian investors, industry insiders say, but demand may still be a trickle compared with that in the US.\n\nHong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Monday gave the green light to multiple mainland Chinese fund houses and local virtual asset firms to move forward with their applications to offer ETFs that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world’s two largest crypto tokens.\n\nThe move, which came only a few months after Hong Kong regulators announced plans to allow spot crypto ETFs, was hailed as a major milestone in the city’s pursuit to become a global virtual asset hub. It also gave the market a rare lead over the US, which has yet to make a decision on allowing spot ether ETFs.\n\n“We can expect a healthy level of interest, especially with other Asian jurisdictions staying away from domestic spot bitcoin ETF issuance for now,” said Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs in the US, which were approved in January, are also available worldwide, but many Asian investors may prefer to avoid the hurdle of opening a US investment account and paying the country’s capital gains tax, said Michael Wong, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in Hong Kong.\n\n“It’s just more convenient for Hong Kong investors or probably Asian investors generally, who don’t want to open a US brokerage account,” Wong said.\n\nJust the fact of having to fill out US tax forms could be a deterrent for some investors looking for exposure to bitcoin, according to Wong, who also noted that Hong Kong does not tax capital gains.\n\nHong Kong’s impending approval of bitcoin and ether ETFs is also a “milestone for the digital asset industry at large”, as it “creates an additional regulated avenue for price exposure to the asset class with the ability to trade within the Asian time zone”, said Chengyi Ong, head of APAC policy at blockchain research firm Chainalysis.\n\nOng noted that demand for price exposure to virtual assets is strong in Asia, which accounted for US$791 billion of the US$1.17 trillion of bitcoin traded in February this year, according to data by crypto news and data outlet The Block. North American investors traded US$113 billion in bitcoin that month.\n\nUltimately, though, demand for the Hong Kong products will come down to the size of the local market, the fees charged, and similar factors, Ong said.\n\n“Expense ratio will definitely be something that investors will look at,” said Dechert’s Wong. “If you have a comparable or competitive expense ratio for [Hong Kong’s spot crypto] ETFs, then I’m sure that it will be very appealing to a lot of the investors.”\n\nOthers have been more dismissive of the new products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that the offering is “child’s play” compared with similar products in the US because Hong Kong is a comparatively “tiny” market. “Don’t expect a lot of flows,” he wrote.\n\nFirms planning to launch spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong should now work on fulfilling other requirements before offering them, such as applying to list them on the local stock exchange, as they await for the SFC’s final approval, according to the regulator. Wong estimated that the ETFs could launch by June.\n\n",

    "content": "Attendance is down, but enthusiasm is up at Hong Kong’s Web3 Festival this year amid sky-high bitcoin prices that have helped draw in an even greater proportion of overseas participants compared with last year.\n\nThe vast majority of participants – an estimated 80 per cent – came from outside Hong Kong, said Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Saturday in his opening remarks. The 2024 conference has seen more exhibitors from Europe and the US specifically, according to Lu Weiding, CEO of Wanxiang Group, which owns the event organiser HashKey Group.\n\nAs Hong Kong forges ahead with its push to transform into a major crypto hub, it has been attracting more Web3 events to the city and trying to bring in big-name speakers. Investor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, was the most high-profile speaker at this year’s Web3 Festival, although she dialled in remotely for a video chat. She praised Hong Kong’s regulatory efforts and suggested the US is lagging behind.\n\n“We are very impressed with what [Hong Kong] has done in providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for exchanges and institutions from a custody point of view,” Wood said in an onstage interview with HashKey Capital. “This regulatory clarity is critical, we think, to enabling the proliferation of the technology faster perhaps in Hong Kong than in the United States.”\n\nWood encouraged businesses in Hong Kong to take advantage of existing regulatory arbitrage as a “global opportunity”. She also offered an extremely optimistic view of where the price of bitcoin is headed: US$1.5 million by 2030. Its record price was more than US$73,000 on March 13 and currently sits around US$68,000.\n\nThis year’s Web3 Festival started shortly after the conclusion of the WOW Summit and the Liquidity 2024 Institutional Digital Asset Summit, which both dealt with crypto-related topics. Even more events are planned for later this year.\n\nMay will see both Wiki Finance Expo and Bitcoin Asia, and Chainlink will host its SmartCon event in Hong Kong in October. CoinDesk – recently acquired by crypto exchange Bullish, which has strong ties to the city – will bring its major Consensus conference to Hong Kong next year.\n\nStill, the flood of events risks dividing attention, especially with so many other major events taking place in other locations. Token2049 – which holds its flagship event in Singapore and once took place in Hong Kong – is hosting its Dubai conference in two weeks. Paris Blockchain Week is also this week, and ETH Seoul was the last three days of March.\n\nWith other events clustered so closely together, the Web3 Festival was smaller in scale than last year, which happened a few months after Hong Kong announced it’s big crypto push.\n\nThe event this year covers less area in the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, and it has fewer exhibitors, according to HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng. However, the event has more sponsorship revenue than last year, and there are more side events, he said.\n\nHong Kong has maintained its commitment to trying to draw the crypto industry to the city after a number of high-profile scandals and collapses in 2022 and 2023. A mandatory licensing scheme that took effect last year was meant to provide regulatory clarity to make the market more attractive. It has drawn 24 applicants so far.\n\nThe city is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are anticipating the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, as well.\n\n“Hong Kong remains the most exciting global opportunity anywhere for a firm wanting to build a virtual assets business or invest in virtual assets,” said Sean Lawrence, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto data provider Kaiko. The city’s advantages include supportive and clear policy directives, a talent pool with experience in traditional finance, and capital to be allocated to virtual assets, he added.\n\nHowever, he noted that entrepreneurs and investors should be “prepared to commit significant time, money and effort”, which are necessary to build consumer-protected, sustainable businesses in Hong Kong.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A mix of mainlanders and international visitors showed up at Bitcoin Asia amid surging interest owing to a crypto bull market and recently launched ETFs.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong this year drew a strong crowd from mainland China, according to organisers, but it is a different, smaller mix of people than the Bitcoin Conference is used to seeing in the US.\n\nThe conference, held on Thursday and Friday, had about 5,500 attendees confirmed ahead of the show, not accounting for door registrations, said David Bailey, co-founder and CEO of BTC Inc, which runs the Bitcoin Conference and owns Bitcoin Magazine. Without having data at hand, Bailey estimated that about half of the attendees were from mainland China, where interest in the conference was strong owing to Hong Kong’s recent launch of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an explosion in development of layer 2 projects.\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts also flew in from other countries for the event. Some in the community expressed hope that the city’s supportive policies for the cryptocurrency industry could eventually be an avenue to tapping investors on the mainland, where commercial crypto trading is banned. Several attendees also suggested that they see Hong Kong’s push to become a crypto hub as tacit support from Beijing.\n\n“I think the ETFs were kind of an admission that bitcoin is here to stay,” Bailey said. “There’s no way that Hong Kong just accidentally stumbled into launching an ETF … It wasn’t random.”\n\nCryptocurrency investors also applauded Hong Kong’s new ETFs, as they accept in-kind subscriptions, which allows purchases made with bitcoin and ether. This feature is “very important”, according to Bailey, because crypto investors can use the ETF shares as collaterals for loans. Managers of Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs Harvest Global and ChinaAMC have both said that they are working on pushing ahead with the collateralisation of their ETF products in the city.\n\nThe Hong Kong government, which invited the Bitcoin Conference to hold its Asia event in the city, has been very supportive, according to Bailey. The city has already hosted multiple Web3-related events this year, including the WOW Summit and Web3 Festival, as it seeks to bring in more tourism and crypto industry players.\n\n“I think they see bitcoin as a massive opportunity for Hong Kong,” Bailey said.\n\nBitcoin Asia is much smaller than the US event, which was previously held in Miami, Florida, and this year will be in Nashville, Tennessee. That conference attracts about 30,000 people, Bailey said. This is the first bitcoin-focused conference of its size in Asia in several years.\n\nAlex McShane, director of programming for the Bitcoin Conference, said the turnout in Hong Kong was still much higher than he expected. The company is now looking at options for the event next year. Bailey said the company is already in discussions with Hong Kong for returning to the city, with eyes on the coveted Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The event this year was held at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.\n\nTokyo and Singapore are also options for future Asia events, according to McShane.\n\nSome in the industry are hoping to regain a foothold in China, a market that was once a major centre of bitcoin activity. That evaporated almost overnight in 2021, when mainland authorities pushed out nearly all bitcoin mining activity, although much of that activity has since returned, albeit quietly.\n\nBen Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canada-based Bitfarms who used to run mining operations in China, said he hopes Hong Kong can be a “conduit for Chinese investors” to access bitcoin-related technologies – something he sees as possibly mitigating the impact of the real estate crash and stock market slump.\n\n“What I’m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to bitcoin and to the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that’s more safe, more controlled or regulated,” Gagnon said.\n\n“I hope that there’s going to be more pathways into mainland China,” he added.\n\nBesides the increasing financialisation of bitcoin, the asset’s price surge this year has also driven interest in layer 2 solutions. A layer 2 on a blockchain is a secondary network meant to help with scalability and efficiency, such as by offloading calculations to a secondary chain that is not as congested.\n\nChinese developers were spread across the main floor of Bitcoin Asia touting new companies building their own layer 2 networks.\n\n“There is an explosion of innovation happening in bitcoin right now,” Bailey said. “To go from, let’s call it 200 million bitcoiners in the world to 2 billion people in the world, we need to dramatically improve bitcoin scalability.”\n\nStill, while optimistic about the new opportunities cropping up in the space, he noted some similarities with previous rounds of bitcoin hype.\n\n“Some of these ideas are going to be famous companies a decade from now; some of these are gonna go to zero,” he said. “So it’s still the wild, wild west but … it’s now the wild west on layer 2 of bitcoin.”\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong’s biggest annual Web3 gathering concluded on Tuesday with industry executives looking to capitalise on the ballooning bitcoin price ahead of what is expected to be the city’s imminent approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the virtual asset this month.\n\nIndustry leaders attending the Hong Kong Web3 Festival shared extremely optimistic projections of the world’s largest cryptocurrency token, the price of which is up 58 per cent to about US$69,000 this year, as the crypto faithful hope to extend the winning streak.\n\nOn the opening day of the event on Saturday, US investor Cathie Wood made the bold prediction that the price of bitcoin was headed to US$1.5 million by 2030. Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Cobo, who uses the name Discus Fish in English, said on Tuesday that he thinks even the prediction of a 2,000 per cent increase in the next six years is “conservative”.\n\n\n\nWhile the conference touched on a range of topics, including real-world asset tokenisation and artificial intelligence, “bitcoin and its ecosystem projects” clearly took “centre stage” at the event, said Lily Z. King, chief operating officer of Cobo.\n\nThe excitement also partially stems from active development of so-called layer-2 bitcoin projects, which are networks that run alongside the main blockchain to help it scale through faster transactions. Many crypto firms see this as an opportunity to boost demand for businesses built around bitcoin.\n\nSpot ETFs are driving the most excitement, though, as it will give investors an easy way to expose themselves to bitcoin without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.\n\nMultiple people attending the event said they expect the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this month, following the approval of such funds in the US in January. Tencent News reported that the first batch could be announced as soon as April 15, with mainland Chinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) to be among the issuers.\n\nThe SFC recently approved Harvest and ChinaAMC to manage portfolios that invest more than 10 per cent in virtual assets, according to the regulator’s website.\n\nHong Kong regulators said in December that the city is prepared to allow retail access to ETFs that invest directly into cryptocurrencies and will start to authorise funds that offer such products.\n\nApart from traditional investors, Hong Kong’s bitcoin spot ETFs will be attractive to “crypto native players” because Hong Kong’s regime is currently the only one in the world that allows in-kind subscriptions, said Marco Lim, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund MaiCapital.\n\nUnder such arrangements, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem spot ETF shares, whereas in the US, these products can only be redeemed with dollars.\n\nThe introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs will be a “monumental stride” not only for the local market, but for the global perception of digital assets, said Cobo’s King. It represents a “significant leap” towards recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate alternative assets and will pave the way for widespread adoption, she added.\n\nExcitement is not just limited to bitcoin, though. Some at the Web3 Festival talked of the potential approval of spot ETFs for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. That is the other cryptocurrency that licensed exchanges can currently offer in Hong Kong.\n\nThat would make Hong Kong a first mover in the space, but it could be a harder sell for regulators. Some bitcoin ETF issuers in the US told CNBC this week that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject ether ETF applications.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain made up about 15 per cent of the talks at Money20/20 Asia this year, just slightly below the proportion of talks on AI, as interest remains high in Asia.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technologies emerged as an important trend at an Asia fintech conference this week, along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOut of the 139 talks and panels at the first Money20/20 in Bangkok – and the first in Asia since a show in Singapore in 2019 – 22 were directly related to blockchain, digital assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the event organisers. AI was still the most talked about tech topic, with 25 sessions in the fintech category directly addressing it.\n\nAsia’s strong interest in blockchain technologies marks a contrast to the US, where Money20/20 holds its flagship conference in Las Vegas. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s moves have dampened enthusiasm for Web3 in the world’s largest economy, conference attendees say, and focus has shifted largely to AI, an area in which the US has a leading position.\n\n\n\nIn Asia, “there’s still more of a focus on Web3, metaverse”, said Danny Levy, managing director of Money20/20 Asia. “We don’t see that at the other events. It’s not really a focus at all.”\n\nDaranee Saeju, assistant governor of the Payment Systems Policy and Financial Consumer Protection Group at the Bank of Thailand, discussed the potential transformative effects of blockchain for developing economies.\n\n“Imagine a world where payments are frictionless, borders are invisible, and money can move very fast, very cheap, convenient, secure and transparent,” Saeju said. “That’s the future we are researching here in Thailand.”\n\nShe mentioned Thailand’s participation in the mBridge project with mainland China, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates for trialling the sending of CBDC payments across borders using blockchain.\n\nJPMorgan announced at the show a partnership with Kasikornbank, one of Thailand’s largest banks, to launch Project Carina, which will allow for fast cross-border payments. The system works by transferring Q-money tied to the Thai Baht on Kasikornbank’s Quarix blockchain to JPMorgan’s JPM Coin on that bank’s Onyx blockchain. The goal is to reduce average transaction times from 72 hours to five minutes, the companies said.\n\n“Spending a lot of time with senior banking execs globally, blockchain is still a conversation now,” said Scarlett Sieber, chief strategy and growth officer at Money 20/20. The JPMorgan announcement comes after a decade of banks talking about working together on blockchain tech, she added.\n\nStablecoins were another big topic of conversation at the show, as companies prepare for coming regulations that could further legitimise the use of cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar (USD).\n\nRipple, which had a booth at the show, announced this month that it is launching its own USD-pegged stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger blockchain, created by the company, and Ethereum. “It’s about providing the option for another settlement currency easily through our network,” said Fiona Murray, managing director of Asia-Pacific (APAC) at Ripple.\n\nAs companies explore the opportunities in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, though, many of the opportunities for infrastructure and business-to-business companies like Ripple are in mature financial markets. Ripple’s biggest markets in APAC are Singapore, where it has its regional headquarters, Hong Kong and Australia, Murray said.\n\nAttendees from Hong Kong were also searching for what opportunities in Southeast Asia mean for the city that has been making a big push to become a Web3 and cryptocurrency hub.\n\n“You heard Bank of Thailand’s aspirations. That’s a lot,” Angelina Kwan, a Hong Kong-based senior adviser to IMC Asia-Pacific, said during a panel discussion about decentralised finance. “We should be worried in Singapore and Hong Kong, because Thailand wants to be a real leader in this area.”\n\nThe latest stage of Hong Kong’s push to formalise rules for the cryptocurrency industry involve a planned stablecoin regulation from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority that will require a licence to issue those products. RD Technologies, which exhibited at the conference, is one of the companies that has been planning to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nBeyond talk around blockchain and AI – which dealt with topics like fraud prevention and regulatory compliance – it was clear that less buzzy and more familiar technologies remain at the centre of the fintech business.\n\nA major theme of the show was financial inclusion. While some speakers touted the benefits of blockchain as a way of reaching and serving unbanked and underbanked populations – a big topic in Southeast Asia – others focused on more staid solutions.\n\nWeLab, which operates the virtual WeLab Bank in Hong Kong and recently started a new joint venture in Indonesia called Bank Saqu, has been looking at opportunities in Southeast Asia for expanding credit. “In Indonesia, the access to credit continues to be one of the biggest challenges,” said Jessica Lam, chief strategy officer at WeLab.\n\n\n\nWeLab, which also operates in mainland China, has sought for its online banks to be more nimble and agile than larger financial institutions, but it is still offering more traditional financial solutions than are typically found in discussions wrapped up in blockchain hype.\n\n“Buzzwords aside, I think it’s about relevance so far,” Lam said. “Is there a meaningful advantage that some of these new technologies and techniques bring? If so, we will incorporate them into our business.”\n\nMoney20/20 Asia returned for the first time in five years, but it switched locations. After cancelling its last Singapore show planned in 2020 because of Covid-19, it has now signed a three-year deal with Thailand to host the regional show in Bangkok.\n\nAttendance surpassed 3,000 people this year, the organisers said, in line with expectations and the 3,100 that attended the 2019 event in Singapore. The last events in Amsterdam and Las Vegas had more than two and three times the number of attendees, respectively, according to the organisers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong has approved preparations for the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world’s two largest cryptocurrency tokens, as the city looks to secure a leading position in the volatile virtual asset sector.\n\nMainland Chinese fund house Bosera Asset Management’s overseas arm and Hong Kong virtual asset firm HashKey Capital received “conditional approval” from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to jointly launch spot crypto ETFs, the companies said in announcements published online on Monday.\n\nChinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) are also among those to receive a green light, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin. ChinaAMC announced that it was working on those ETF products after receiving SFC approval to provide virtual asset management services.\n\n\n\nThe SFC, which first published rules for allowing spot crypto ETFs in December, was widely expected to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this week. The inclusion of spot ether ETFs makes it the first market in Asia, and the first global finance hub, to approve such a product. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved spot bitcoin ETFs, but it has delayed a decision on similar ether products.\n\nThe SFC has not made any announcement on the ETFs, as none have been officially approved yet. The conditional approval allows applicants to move forward with preparations to offer the funds, such as applying to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) to offer them on the local stock exchange.\n\n“The SFC issues a conditional authorisation letter to an ETF application if it generally satisfies our requirements, subject to various conditions, including fee payments, filing of documents and HKEX’s listing approval,” the SFC said in a statement to the Post, without clarifying the status of any spot crypto ETF applications.\n\nSpot crypto ETFs are considered a boon for investors who want exposure to such assets without needing to worry about setting up their own blockchain wallets or other technical details that can be a hurdle. ETFs can also be included in things like retirement funds, making them more appealing to mainstream investors.\n\nSince the US started allowing spot bitcoin ETFs this year, they have seen more than US$200 billion in trading volume, according to crypto news and data outlet The Block.\n\nBitcoin’s price has been surging since late last year, and especially after the US ETF approval in January. However, the price has fallen about 8 per cent in the past week to around US$66,700. After approving the spot ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned that bitcoin remains a “speculative, volatile asset”.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly delayed making a decision on ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. It is expected to conclude its review in late May.\n\nThat makes the approval in Hong Kong, which normally trails the US in approving such financial instruments, look more ambitious as the city seeks to transform itself into a virtual asset hub.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong market is relatively small, industry insiders say local spot crypto ETFs could be globally competitive because they allow for both cash and in-kind subscriptions – i.e. converting bitcoin or ether into their ETF equivalents. In the US, the products can only be purchased with dollars.\n\nThe in-kind arrangement offers benefits such as lower transactional costs and higher operational efficiencies, said Andrew Fei, a partner at King \u0026 Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\n\n“The approvals of the first spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs in Asia mark an important milestone in Hong Kong’s bid to become a global digital assets hub,” Fei said. “The strong crypto investor base in Asia, combined with the in-kind redemption feature and support for HK dollar trading, give these Hong Kong ETFs a real competitive edge.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Haldane.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong’s biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange operator, HashKey Group, has launched a new global trading platform that it hopes will help the company overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency exchange, HashKey Global, operates with a Digital Asset Business licence issued in Bermuda. It is now available globally with one big caveat: for regulatory reasons, certain markets like the US, mainland China and Hong Kong cannot use it, HashKey Group chief operating officer (COO) Livio Weng said in an interview on Saturday on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, a crypto conference organised by the company.\n\nThe company, established in Hong Kong in 2018, operates the local HashKey Exchange, which was approved by the city’s securities regulator last August to serve retail investors under the city’s new crypto regulatory regime. The exchange can so far only offer bitcoin and ether for retail trading.\n\n\n\nHashKey Exchange now has more than 170,000 registered users, Weng said on Saturday. It hosted about US$35 million in 24-hour trading volume on Monday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, which ranks the platform 15th according to a trust score that tries to measure legitimacy of trading data. However, HashKey’s volume is still a trickle compared with some of the world’s largest exchanges.\n\nBinance had US$6.3 billion in 24-hour normalised trading volume by mid-day on Monday, while OKX recorded more than US$2.1 billion, CoinGecko shows.\n\nHashKey is hoping that a new global exchange will supercharge its market position. Weng said the company intends to have more trading volume than Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, across all HashKey Group platforms by 2029.\n\n“We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult,” Weng said.\n\nThe global exchange could be particularly appealing to overseas Chinese and investors across Asian markets that do not block offshore crypto exchanges, according to the COO.\n\nFacing intense competition from existing crypto exchanges around the world, HashKey Global has an advantage as a compliant platform that also offers a smooth experience, Weng said.\n\nMost of the world’s major exchanges are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, he said.\n\nHashKey Group – whose businesses include the investment firm HashKey Capital and an asset-management arm – is among a range of cryptocurrency companies banking on Hong Kong’s embrace of the virtual asset industry.\n\nWhile public perception of the sector took a plunge last year following high-profile scandals – including the collapse of FTX in late 2022 and a local fraud involving the lesser known JPEX exchange a year later – confidence has rebounded in recent months after a surge in bitcoin prices in the new year. It hit a new record of more than US$73,000 last month.\n\nApart from a mandatory licensing regime for crypto exchanges, Hong Kong is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are also anticipating an imminent approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the city.\n\n",

    "summary": "Trading could begin later this year, as the ETF issuers sill have to get the green light before launching the products.\n\n",
    "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved applications from Nasdaq, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of ether, potentially paving the way for the products to begin trading later this year.\n\nWhile the ETF issuers also have to get the green light before the products can launch, Thursday’s approval is a major surprise win for those firms and the cryptocurrency industry, which until Monday had expected the SEC to reject the filings.\n\nNine issuers including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock hope to launch ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency after the SEC in January approved bitcoin ETFs in a watershed moment for the industry.\n\n“This is an exciting moment for the industry at large,” said Andrew Jacobson, vice-president and head of legal at 21Shares, noting it was “a significant step” towards getting the products trading.\n\nThursday was the deadline for the SEC to decide on VanEck’s filing. Market participants were bracing for the thumbs-down because the SEC had not engaged with them on the applications.\n\nBut in a surprise move, SEC officials on Monday asked the exchanges to quickly fine-tune the filings, sending the industry scrambling to complete weeks of work in just days, sources said.\n\nReuters could not ascertain why the SEC appeared to have a change of heart.\n\n“The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has already demonstrated significant benefits for the digital assets and ETF space, and we believe that spot ether ETFs will similarly provide safeguards for US investors,” said Rob Marrocco, global head of exchange-traded product listings at Cboe Global Markets.\n\nNasdaq and NYSE declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked about the ether ETFs by reporters at an industry event earlier on Thursday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler – a crypto sceptic – declined to comment. An SEC spokesperson said in an email announcing the approval that the agency would not comment further.\n\nThe exchange applications had sought SEC approval for a rule change required to list new products, but the issuers still need the SEC to approve ETF registration statements detailing investor disclosures before they can start trading.\n\nUnlike the exchange filings, there is no set time frame in which the SEC has to decide on those statements. Industry participants said it was unclear how long that would take.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the process said many issuers are ready to launch, but the corporate finance division of the SEC has indicated it is likely to request changes and updates in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe SEC rejected spot bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade over market manipulation worries but was forced to approve them after Grayscale Investments won a court challenge last year.\n\nSui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, the index-provider for several of the bitcoin and ether ETFs, said ether is more complex than bitcoin and it could take months for the SEC to review the statements. But since the bitcoin ETFs offer an established template, “there’s only so much slow rolling” the SEC can do, he said.\n\nAn array of investors, including hedge funds, wealth advisers and retail investors, have poured more than US$30 billion into the crypto ETFs.\n\nThursday’s decision is another tailwind for cryptocurrency industry efforts to push into mainstream finance. This week the UK regulator also approved listed cryptocurrency products while the US House of Representatives passed a landmark bill seeking to provide regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile that bill still needs to pass the Senate, its extensive bipartisan support marks a major endorsement for the industry.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "HashKey will facilitate the sale and purchase of Toncoin, the native token of the TON blockchain, which was started by Telegram Messenger.\n\n",
    "content": "HashKey Group, operator of one of only two licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong, is teaming up with the operator of the blockchain created by Telegram Messenger to give users an on- and off-ramp by exchanging their so-called Toncoins for cash.\n\nThe agreement applies to users in the Asia-Pacific region and will see the two organizations work on “new ecosystem projects by providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and other incubation activities”, TON Foundation said in an announcement on Friday.\n\nThe foundation governing TON – an acronym that once stood for Telegram Open Network and now means simply The Open Network – was set up after Telegram was forced to abandon the blockchain because of a settlement with the US Securities and Futures Commission in 2020. The separate organisation has continued to develop the blockchain and later integrated it into Telegram through a mini app and business arrangements.\n\n“This is potentially quite massive,” TON Foundation president Steve Yun said. He referenced HashKey’s regulatory compliance as a way to help with know-your-customer (KYC) rules. “We do take strategic steps to make sure we follow the compliance requirements.”\n\n\n\nEven as TON has sought to keep itself separate from Telegram, the main utility of its blockchain remains tied to the popular messaging app, which has more than 900 million users globally, according to Yun. While anyone can build mini apps integrating other public blockchains into Telegram, the TON Foundation pays for premium real estate in the app, making it the default wallet option in the sidebar.\n\nHowever, TON is still grappling with regulatory issues. To avoid complications, it bars people in certain jurisdictions such as the US, China and Hong Kong from using the cryptocurrency function within Telegram.\n\nTelegram is blocked in mainland China, but the app became popular in Hong Kong during the 2019 anti-government protests. It has also become the messenger of choice for crypto enthusiasts. Despite its security issues compared with WhatsApp and Signal, features like broadcast channels and trading bots are popular in the community.\n\nTON is betting on the mini app ecosystem on Telegram as a means of driving adoption of its blockchain, which Yun said can scale better than most blockchains because of its use of sharding – a means of breaking up a blockchain into different segments.\n\nGreater adoption means more users will be looking for ways to convert their tokens to cash and vice versa. TON also sees Asia as a natural fit because they are already used to the “super app” concept, according to Yun, hence the team-up with HashKey in the region.\n\n“Where in the world do [people] know how to build mini apps as part of a super app? Not many places,” Yun said. “Eastern Europe because VK is popular. [Asia-Pacific] because of Line, Kakao and WeChat.”\n\nThe agreement also adds to HashKey’s recent expansion efforts. The Hong Kong-based company became the second licensed crypto exchange operator in the city in 2022, nearly two years after BC Technology Group, which operates the OSL exchange.\n\nDuring the Web3 Festival, which HashKey organised, the company on Monday launched a global crypto exchange. TON was also a major sponsor of the festival, where it held several talks and events.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission upgraded HashKey’s licence to allow the company to sell crypto-related investment products to retail investors. It has already been selling bitcoin and ether on its retail-facing platform that it launched in November.\n\nThe local crypto firm known today mostly just in Hong Kong has been looking to transform itself into a major international player. Livio Weng, the chief operating officer, said this week that HashKey intends to surpass Coinbase in trading volume by 2030. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, currently has around 30 times the 24-hour trading volume of HashKey.\n\nTeaming with TON foundation offers it a different avenue to scale than Coinbase, which has seen its fortunes rise with the popularity of bitcoin since its founding 12 years ago. HashKey is just half that age.\n\nIf Toncoin becomes popular through its integration with Telegram and its myriad mini apps, as the TON Foundation is betting on, then HashKey could suddenly find itself with millions of potential new users across Asia as it facilitates the default medium of exchange on one of the world’s most popular messenger apps.\n\n",

    "summary": "Six bitcoin and ether ETFs saw US$12 million in trading on Tuesday, compared with US$4.6 billion for US bitcoin ETFs on their first day.\n\n",
    "content": "Asia’s first exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in bitcoin and ether started trading in Hong Kong on Tuesday with early gains in morning trading, marking a significant move in the city’s effort to become a cryptocurrency hub.\n\nSix spot crypto ETFs that invest in the world’s two largest cryptocurrency tokens debuted on the Hong Kong stock exchange, launched by mainland Chinese fund managers ChinaAMC, Harvest International, and Bosera Asset Management, which is teaming with HashKey Capital, the investment arm of Hong Kong crypto firm HashKey Group.\n\nChinaAMC and Harvest’s bitcoin ETFs closed up about 1.5 per cent each, while Borsera’s closed up 1.8 per cent. All three ether ETFs closed down less than 1 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs saw nearly HK$67 million (US$9.2 million) in trading volume by the end of the day, with ChinaAMC’s ETF seeing the most trading with about HK$37 million changing hands.\n\nHong Kong’s launch of new crypto ETFs, seen as offering some advantages for investors in Asia compared with similar products in the US that are much bigger in scale, will test the city’s progress in its pursuit of becoming a hub for virtual asset businesses.\n\nThe six Hong Kong funds racked up nearly HK$87 million by the close of trading. In comparison, 11 bitcoin ETFs in the US, which debuted in January, saw more than US$4.6 billion traded on their first day.\n\nHong Kong could expect the trading volume of its spot crypto ETFs to reach 20 per cent of those in the US within about a year, HashKey Group chief operating officer Livio Weng said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nMarket makers likely contributed the bulk of first-day trading, so it remains to be seen how demand for these products will hold up in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFund managers and brokerages are dangling favourable policies to draw investors, with Harvest waiving its management fee for six months and Bosera for four months. Online Chinese brokerage Tiger Brokers said in a statement on Monday that it is offering platform fee exemptions for the first batch of these ETFs.\n\nGiven the Hong Kong ETF market’s diminutive size compared with the US, the funds are hoping to draw investors looking for products offered specifically in Asia.\n\nNon-Hong Kong residents can purchase shares in the crypto ETFs as long as they pass local know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, HashKey Capital said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWhile that means the ETFs are technically available to mainland Chinese investors who have Hong Kong bank or brokerage accounts, investing in these products could still be difficult because mainland identity cards may not be able to pass brokerage platforms’ KYC procedures, said one industry insider who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nBeijing has strictly banned commercial cryptocurrency trading on the mainland. Other types of ETFs can already be traded through the Stock Connect scheme that links to markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nHong Kong regulators at the launch event on Tuesday morning, which included a bell-ringing ceremony, cautioned that there are high risks involved in the crypto-based products despite the successful listings.\n\n“Our approval for virtual asset ETFs does not equate to us supporting the relevant virtual assets or us encouraging the public to invest in them,” Christina Choi Fung Yee, executive director of investment products at the Securities and Futures Commission, said during the ceremony. “Virtual assets are extremely speculative with highly volatile prices … I’d like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors.”\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin halving, a once-every-four year event baked into the system, will slash the reward that is the main revenue stream for miners.\n\n",
    "content": "About 6,000 older bitcoin mining machines in the US will soon be idled and sent to a warehouse in Colorado Springs, where they will be refreshed and resold to buyers overseas looking to profit from mining in lower-cost environments.\n\nWholesaler SunnySide Digital operates the 35,000-square-foot facility taking in the equipment from a mining client. The outdated machines are among several hundred-thousand it expects to receive and refurbish around a major quadrennial update in the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nKnown as the halving, the late April event will slash the reward that is the main revenue stream for miners, who will try to lessen the impact by upgrading to the latest and most efficient technology.\n\nWith electricity the biggest expense, mining companies including publicly traded giants Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms need to lower usage costs to maintain a positive margin. Their older computers may still bring a profit, just not likely in the US.\n\n“It’s a natural migration” with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world where power is the cheapest, said SunnySide Digital chief executive officer Taras Kulyk, who has resold US computers to miners in countries such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay and Uruguay. “This is accelerated by the halving.”\n\nSome 600,000 S19 series computers, which account for a majority of machines currently in use, are moving out of the US mostly to Africa and South America, according to an estimate by Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology in Seattle.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, specialised machines are used to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn operators a fixed token reward.\n\nAnonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto baked in the once-every-four-years halving to maintain the hard cap of 21 million tokens. Next month’s event is the fourth since 2012 and the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoin from 6.25 now.\n\nBitcoin has surged about 50 per cent this year to around US$63,500, though it is down from a record high of US$73,798 reached on March 14.\n\nBringing more efficient machines online has become more urgent with the halving just weeks away, as continued use of older equipment could mean electricity costs will be close to or exceed mining revenue.\n\nWhile S19 series and similar models might not be profitable to run in the US after the halving, they “can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in parts of Africa, said Jaran Mellerud, CEO at Dubai-based Hashlabs Mining, which leases data centre space in Ethiopia and provides hosting services to bitcoin miners.\n\nSome buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more, said Lauren Lin, Luxor’s business development director.\n\nThe used S19 models cost about US$7,030 in March 2022, according to Luxor, which runs a trading desk for used machines. The price dropped dramatically a year later to about US$900 as bitcoin prices sank, then to about US$427 this month and is estimated to sell for about US$356 in May, after the halving.\n\nThere are miners in the US opting not to sell their hardware and instead transfer the equipment to regions with lower electricity costs and third-party data centres. Nuo Xu, who has two sites in Texas, is travelling this month to Ethiopia, Nigeria and a few other countries to scope out locations for about 6,000 older computers.\n\n“There are more risks for my machines in Africa but I have to move them there,” he said. “Cheaper electricity outside the US means it will take a much shorter time to recover the overhead costs,” with labour and building materials also much less expensive, he said.\n\nMiners globally who do not have their own facilities pay a hosting fee, which typically includes electricity, labour and third-party operators.\n\nIt has been Xu’s experience that fees in the US come to about 7 US cents per kilowatt hour. In Ethiopia, which has loosened regulations on crypto mining and increased its power generation, the rate is about 5 US cents, according to Hashlab’s Mellerud. That two-cent difference is huge for miners.\n\nElectricity itself is about 3 US cents per kWh in Ethiopia, according to Hiwot Eshetu, marketing and business development director at Ethiopian Electric Power. In the US, the range is about 3 US cents to 6 US cents, based on estimates from Luxor.\n\n“Ethiopia is really becoming a big player in the digital mining ecosystem,” said SunnySide’s Kulyk, who added his company is negotiating a deal to help move between 20,000 and 40,000 rigs to the east African nation.\n\n\n\nNot all US-based equipment leaves the country. That process can be tougher for publicly traded companies because they have to take risk-averse shareholders into account. There is also some hesitation to relocate machines abroad due to transport costs, breakage and security concerns.\n\nPublicly traded Bit Digital, one of the biggest bitcoin miners, has older generations of computers sitting dormant in a warehouse in Houston.\n\n“These machines basically collect dust every now and again,” said CEO Sam Tabar. But the New York-based company holds onto them because when bitcoin prices are high, the computers can be pulled out of retirement and still make a profit, he said.\n\nMiners have been prepping for the halving for years and are spending big bucks to replace their older hardware.\n\nThe 13 major public bitcoin-mining companies, including Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, have placed orders for more than US$1 billion worth of machines since February 2023, according to crypto-mining researcher TheMinerMag.\n\nFive of the biggest miners raised more than US$2.7 billion from selling shares in the two years ended in December. Since the start of this year, those same miners have raked in an additional US$840 million, according to the researcher.\n\n",

A better understanding of the reasons for which Bitcoin wallets might be lost can help you prevent such losses. In addition, it can also help you find the best ways to restore your lost assets. Here are the common reasons for which you can lose Bitcoin wallets. Loss of Private Keys One of the most important aspects of accessing your Bitcoin wallet is the private key. Private keys are strings of characters that are unique to each wallet and can help access and manage Bitcoin. Most of the people who ask questions like “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” are troubled by the problem of losing their private keys. Losing your private key is similar to losing the keys to your safe. An individual can lose their private keys due to data corruption, forgetfulness, or hardware failure. Therefore, it is important to follow safe storage practices to safeguard your private keys. Death of Bitcoin Wallet Owner The death of a Bitcoin wallet owner also presents a formidable challenge to the world of digital assets. If the Bitcoin wallet owner has not implemented any measures for estate planning to transfer private key information, then their Bitcoin wallet might become completely inaccessible. It creates difficulty for Bitcoin wallet recovery, as highlighted in various examples. Therefore, it is important to include cryptocurrencies in estate planning or choose Dead Man’s switches for crypto. Sending Bitcoin to Wrong Addresses Anyone can send Bitcoins to the wrong address by mistake. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover the assets from your wallet. Therefore, you should double-check the transaction details before sending Bitcoin. Bitcoin Burn Wallets Bitcoin wallets can be inaccessible when they are used as burn wallets. The primary purpose of burning wallets is to remove coins from circulation. You cannot think of methods to recover Bitcoin wallet passwords for burn wallets as they don’t offer scope for retrieval. Bitcoin is sent to burn wallets with the intention of making them permanently inaccessible. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Bitcoin wallets can become dormant when they have not been utilized in any transaction for a long period. There are different reasons for which Bitcoin wallets can become dormant, such as owners losing interest in Bitcoin. Dormant wallets can indicate the removal of Bitcoin from active circulation, which enhances its scarcity. Bitcoin Theft Bitcoin wallets are not immune to theft. You might have to find ways to restore Bitcoin wallet when you fall victim to Bitcoin theft. Cybercriminals and hackers use different types of tactics to lay their hands on your Bitcoin wallets. For example, they can use social engineering attacks to trick users into entering their private keys. Frozen Bitcoin Wallets Centralized exchanges are the popular choices among Bitcoin wallets that offer custodial solutions without any burden of managing your Bitcoins. However, the problem with centralized exchanges is that they can freeze your wallets anytime.

You must learn about Bitcoin wallet backup restore features only with an in-depth understanding of public and private keys. However, human error can creep in somewhere, and you may end up giving away your private keys or forgetting that you even have a wallet. If you don’t remember where you have stored your Bitcoin wallet, you can look for your wallet data on your computer or storage devices. The wallet file is available as ‘wallet.dat,’ and it includes your transaction history, private keys, and public keys.

You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet. If you don’t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the ‘wallet.dat’ file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions. Restore Your Bitcoin Hardware Wallet You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it. Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet. At the same time, it is also important to remember that top hardware wallet devices offer advanced security features, making them completely immune to physical hacking.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren’t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space. Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course dYdX Order-based DEXs did not match up to the challenge of achieving better solutions to issues of centralized exchanges. However, dYdX still enjoys popularity amidst AMM-based DEXs. It offers many features like shirt selling, leveraged trading, and lending. Therefore, it is a better alternative than simple AMMs. dYdX is a promising addition to the most popular decentralized exchanges, and it combines multiple features in one package. It offers a user-friendly interface, deep liquidity, and advantages of low fees. Uniswap Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in the market, with a wide user base. It offers liquidity for the most popular crypto tokens and leverages AMMs for self-regulation. The DAO governance makes Uniswap one of the best-decentralized exchanges with better efficiency and transparency. On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience. Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX. Curve Finance The next top name among the biggest decentralized exchanges is Curve Finance. As a matter of fact, Curve Finance is the second biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum in terms of TVL. Initially, it offered the facility for stablecoin swaps only. However, it has evolved and offers many trading pairs now. On the other hand, the optimization of Curve Finance for stablecoin trading makes it the best pick for low-slippage rates. Another impressive feature of Curve Finance is the support for multiple blockchains alongside better efficiency for larger transactions. Balancer Balancer is another popular choice among decentralized exchanges for its unique features. It is a prominent answer to questions such as “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” because of its capability to help users manage a diverse portfolio. The DEX offers the flexibility for creating and joining pools with a combination of eight different crypto tokens. Balancer is the ideal decentralized exchange for anyone who wants to manage a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns. SushiSwap Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards. However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol. Orca The goals of Orca also focus on overcoming the pitfalls of centralized crypto exchanges, such as ensuring faster and more secure transactions. It is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges with the flexibility for trading cryptocurrencies on Solana blockchain. The most prominent feature of Orca is the innovative UI that helps users change their language settings directly from the DEX and view token balances. On top of that, Orca has proved to be the best pick for traders who prefer anonymity. Users can also capitalize on the advantage of trading directly from wallets and reducing the risk of losing funds to hacking or third-party mismanagement. Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens. Vertex The most interesting origin story among decentralized exchanges probably belongs to Vertex. It is the perfect example of how the best-decentralized exchanges can brave any odds. Vertex was created on the Terra blockchain, which suffered a massive breakdown. However, the decentralized exchange did not stop there, and all its operations were transitioned to the Arbitrum blockchain. Vertex went through major changes in its overall structure and goals. One of the most interesting features of Vertex is the option for bridging to 8 different blockchains, which ensures interoperability. In addition, it also offers faster order-matching mechanisms that can improve efficiency of crypto transactions. Apex Protocol The collection of the best DEXs would be incomplete without adding the Apex protocol. It has gained popularity for offering an elastic AMM. Apex protocol is also one of the top decentralized exchanges, with the facility for order book trading. Beginners can also leverage the flexibility for spot trading on the platform. Another unique highlight of the Apex protocol is the Starkware layer 2 scalability mechanism that also addresses security concerns. As a matter of fact, Apex protocol has gained popularity for offering improved privacy and security features. How Can You Choose the Right DEXs? As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs. First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage. You must also evaluate a decentralized exchange on the basis of whether it is open or permissioned. For example, certain DEXs only allow the community members to add new liquidity pools. Most importantly, you can compare the best DEXs on the basis of their security features.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is evolving at an impressive pace with the integration of new utilities in cryptocurrencies. Everyone who wants to begin trading in cryptocurrencies is likely to choose third-party wallets or crypto wallets. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has attracted cybercriminals’ attention. The evolution of cryptocurrency sector and introduction of new security measures cannot adapt to the tactics of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers. Therefore, crypto wallet security has emerged as a top priority for crypto users. It is important to reflect on the threat of security risks for crypto wallets and how to ensure effective safeguards against the risks. Let us learn more about the best practices to protect your crypto wallets from prominent security threats. Fundamentals of Crypto Wallets The best way to understand the implications of security for crypto wallets involves learning about the fundamentals of crypto wallets. It can help you understand the potential risks for security of cryptocurrency wallets with knowledge of their working mechanisms. Crypto wallets are digital tools for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The working mechanism of crypto wallets revolves around the use of a public key and private key. Public key is the public address of the cryptocurrency wallet. It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security. The important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key. Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course How Many Types of Crypto Wallets Can You Use? The concerns regarding security of crypto wallets round-up on the selection of an ideal crypto wallet. You can find answers to “How secure is a crypto wallet?” by checking the type of the wallet. Some of the most popular crypto wallet variants include hardware wallets, software wallets, paper wallets, and web wallets. Hardware Wallets Hardware wallets are USB-shaped devices that offer storage of private keys in an offline environment. Therefore, they are the most trusted picks for secure crypto storage. Hardware wallets are the best choice to avoid messages like “crypto wallet hacked” as they are immune to malware. However, hardware wallets have setbacks, such as complex setup processes and limited accessibility. Software Wallets Software wallets are programs that you can use on mobile devices or computers to store and trade cryptocurrencies. While software wallets guarantee convenient and quick transactions, they are vulnerable to malware and hacking attacks. Paper Wallets Paper wallets are physical documents on which you can write your private and public keys. You can trust paper wallets for security against hacking and malware, as you can store paper wallets in secure locations. On the other hand, crypto wallet security for paper wallets is restricted to physical vulnerabilities and a lack of recovery mechanisms. On top of it, retrieving and using your cryptocurrencies can be a challenging task with paper wallets. Web Wallets Web wallets or hosted wallets are offered by online platforms and third-party websites. Such types of wallets offer better convenience for faster access to cryptocurrencies and completion of transactions. However, they are limited in terms of security due to the storage of private keys on remote servers.

You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet. If you don’t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the ‘wallet.dat’ file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions. Restore Your Bitcoin Hardware Wallet You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it. Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet. At the same time, it is also important to remember that top hardware wallet devices offer advanced security features, making them completely immune to physical hacking.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren’t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space. Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course dYdX Order-based DEXs did not match up to the challenge of achieving better solutions to issues of centralized exchanges. However, dYdX still enjoys popularity amidst AMM-based DEXs. It offers many features like shirt selling, leveraged trading, and lending. Therefore, it is a better alternative than simple AMMs. dYdX is a promising addition to the most popular decentralized exchanges, and it combines multiple features in one package. It offers a user-friendly interface, deep liquidity, and advantages of low fees. Uniswap Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in the market, with a wide user base. It offers liquidity for the most popular crypto tokens and leverages AMMs for self-regulation. The DAO governance makes Uniswap one of the best-decentralized exchanges with better efficiency and transparency. On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience. Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX. Curve Finance The next top name among the biggest decentralized exchanges is Curve Finance. As a matter of fact, Curve Finance is the second biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum in terms of TVL. Initially, it offered the facility for stablecoin swaps only. However, it has evolved and offers many trading pairs now. On the other hand, the optimization of Curve Finance for stablecoin trading makes it the best pick for low-slippage rates. Another impressive feature of Curve Finance is the support for multiple blockchains alongside better efficiency for larger transactions. Balancer Balancer is another popular choice among decentralized exchanges for its unique features. It is a prominent answer to questions such as “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” because of its capability to help users manage a diverse portfolio. The DEX offers the flexibility for creating and joining pools with a combination of eight different crypto tokens. Balancer is the ideal decentralized exchange for anyone who wants to manage a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns. SushiSwap Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards. However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol. Orca The goals of Orca also focus on overcoming the pitfalls of centralized crypto exchanges, such as ensuring faster and more secure transactions. It is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges with the flexibility for trading cryptocurrencies on Solana blockchain. The most prominent feature of Orca is the innovative UI that helps users change their language settings directly from the DEX and view token balances. On top of that, Orca has proved to be the best pick for traders who prefer anonymity. Users can also capitalize on the advantage of trading directly from wallets and reducing the risk of losing funds to hacking or third-party mismanagement. Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens. Vertex The most interesting origin story among decentralized exchanges probably belongs to Vertex. It is the perfect example of how the best-decentralized exchanges can brave any odds. Vertex was created on the Terra blockchain, which suffered a massive breakdown. However, the decentralized exchange did not stop there, and all its operations were transitioned to the Arbitrum blockchain. Vertex went through major changes in its overall structure and goals. One of the most interesting features of Vertex is the option for bridging to 8 different blockchains, which ensures interoperability. In addition, it also offers faster order-matching mechanisms that can improve efficiency of crypto transactions. Apex Protocol The collection of the best DEXs would be incomplete without adding the Apex protocol. It has gained popularity for offering an elastic AMM. Apex protocol is also one of the top decentralized exchanges, with the facility for order book trading. Beginners can also leverage the flexibility for spot trading on the platform. Another unique highlight of the Apex protocol is the Starkware layer 2 scalability mechanism that also addresses security concerns. As a matter of fact, Apex protocol has gained popularity for offering improved privacy and security features. How Can You Choose the Right DEXs? As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs. First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage. You must also evaluate a decentralized exchange on the basis of whether it is open or permissioned. For example, certain DEXs only allow the community members to add new liquidity pools. Most importantly, you can compare the best DEXs on the basis of their security features.

Final Words The growing popularity of decentralized exchanges has become a major highlight in the crypto space. They are more efficient, secure, and faster than centralized exchanges. Most important of all, the continuously expanding list of decentralized exchanges brings new options for staking and yield farming.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren’t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space.

As a result, they could focus more on tasks such as interacting with customers and providing advice. Automation also helps reduce paperwork, which is a major goal for different financial firms. According to Reuters, banks would spend billions of dollars every year on compliance activities and paperwork. Financial advisors can also use machine learning to avoid mistakes in manual data entry tasks. Data Management The applications of ML in finance also involve data management. Data management is a crucial requirement in the financial services sector as it helps collect, store, and segment data for better analysis. The use of machine learning in finance can help in enhancing data management to ensure effective monitoring of volatility in financial markets. For example, ML systems can monitor data about all transactions by a firm to recognize patterns or trends that may indicate malicious activities. Trading Assistance Trading strategies used commonly by firms have a major effect on efficiency and costs. The applications of machine learning systems can offer new prospects for creating trading strategies based on algorithms. You can find examples of ‘How is machine learning used in finance?’ in the algorithmic trading tools. The algorithms can automatically purchase and sell on your behalf according to market conditions. As a result, trading firms can prevent placing trades that cannot offer the desired profits. Algorithmic trading strategies have emerged as a popular alternative to ensure efficient management of risk alongside generating more returns. Loan Approval Financial institutions have to deal with a lot of paperwork in the process of loan approval. The manual process involves a review of loan applications to make decisions for approval. It can be a costly and time-consuming process. However, loan approvals provide the scope for a popular machine learning use case in finance with new ML systems. The new systems can ensure automatic review of loan applications. On top of it, machine learning can also make recommendations rather than just provide approval or deny loan applications. It helps save time and ensures approval of loans for people who would pay back the loans. As a result, ML algorithms can help in lowering the risks for lenders. Fraud Detection Machine learning systems can also help financial service firms detect fraud. The traditional methods involved rule-based systems that used predefined criteria to point out malicious transactions. However, the uses of machine learning in finance industry have been evolving. As a result, ML systems can offer faster data analysis with better accuracy. On top of it, machine learning systems can also identify anomalies and patterns that indicate potentially malicious activities. For instance, Amazon Fraud Detector by AWS uses ML algorithms to comprehensively analyze transaction data and predict the possibility of fraud risk in real-time. Therefore, machine learning can help financial institutions reduce operational, reputational, and financial risks. Regulatory Compliance Compliance is an integral aspect of the financial services sector. However, it is difficult for financial institutions to stay updated with new changes in regulations across different countries and jurisdictions within a country. Failure to comply with regulations can lead to penalties and loss of reputation. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms can help identify potential violations in regulatory compliance. ML systems can also create reports for regulatory agencies to prove that financial institutions follow all the required regulations. Churn Prediction Another prominent case of ML being used in finance is churn prediction. It helps in checking out which customers would leave a financial services firm or platform. Such applications of machine learning in finance involve churn tracking, which helps identify potential areas for improvement. For example, financial services firms can offer better training to their advisors and improve their customer experiences. On top of it, churn prediction also helps develop a better understanding of customers and figure out potential ways to prevent churn. With the right ML tools, advisors can also identify the clients who are likely to leave and offer useful advice to them.

    "summary": "Discover three ways to increase transparency and mitigate risk around token bridges to help protect end users.\n\n",
    "content": "Driven by the demand for a more holistic Web3 user experience, cross-chain bridges are used to transfer digital assets from one blockchain network to another through wrapped tokens—one-to-one digital representations of tokens from another blockchain. They’re needed because blockchains are generally not interoperable by default. Wrapped tokens unlock cross-chain liquidity, but often require additional trust assumptions compared to assets native to a single blockchain. How cross-chain token bridges operate. The Complexities of Cross-Chain Bridge Security Cross-chain token bridges face an array of security challenges, from securing private keys to ensuring airtight smart contract code. Developers must take a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach to cross-chain bridge architecture, with independent layers of security at every step, from technical to social. Though cross-chain bridges are an integral part of Web3, they’ve historically been a target for malicious actors. Cross-chain bridge security shouldn’t just be reactive; it should proactively account for the possibilities of an attack or exploit and protect against the potential outcomes. The key question is: What do you do when a carefully laid security plan goes awry? Exploit and Attack Risks Regardless of how a bridge is compromised, there are often two immediate risks that come from bridge attacks and exploits. 1. Collateral on the source chain is withdrawn without correct ownership. User funds on the source blockchain are stolen and corresponding wrapped tokens are no longer fully backed. Because wrapped assets only hold value due to their cross-chain backing, stealing locked assets on the source blockchain effectively makes corresponding wrapped assets worthless. Digital assets locked on the source blockchain are stolen. 2. Cross-chain tokens on the destination chain are minted without sufficient collateral. Known as an “infinite mint” exploit, this is when an excess of wrapped tokens without sufficient reserves are minted, meaning they are no longer sufficiently collateralized. Infinite mint exploits lead to fractional reserve practices, and malicious actors can take advantage of this by either selling the wrapped token assets on a decentralized exchange or using the tokens as collateral on a lending market. How an infinite mint hack works. Ecosystem Risk A compromised cross-chain token bridge poses an immediate risk not only to bridge users but also to any project that directly integrates support for the wrapped token. Wrapped tokens are often used within DeFi protocols, and an exploit or hack can significantly impact operations and sometimes lead to protocol insolvency. For example, using wrapped tokens as collateral within a pooled DeFi lending market can put users at risk, even if they only lend or borrow network-native assets. If a wrapped token used as collateral is exploited, it can result in the loss of lender (or protocol) funds, leading to insolvencies that can not only impact users, but cause ripple effects across the wider ecosystem. How an exploiter can use an “infinite mint” attack to exploit a pooled DeFi lending market. As cross-chain token bridges and their wrapped tokens gain adoption, the ecosystem risk, if a bridge’s security is compromised, grows. How Chainlink Proof of Reserve Helps Supercharge Wrapped Token Transparency and Security Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) provides smart contracts with the information needed to calculate the true collateralization of any cross-chain reserves backing wrapped tokens. Operated by a decentralized network of oracles, Chainlink Proof of Reserve verifies cross-chain collateral—acting as a data layer for a wrapped token bridge. Chainlink Proof of Reserve is a data layer for cross-chain bridges, enabling any user to independently verify collateral balances on the destination chain. Note: Chainlink PoR increases transparency into the reserves backing wrapped tokens, and can be used for additional safeguard features, but doesn’t prevent a cross-chain bridge from being drained due to an exploit. Rather, PoR can be used by bridges and dApps to help mitigate the impact of such events. There are 3 main benefits to using Chainlink Proof of Reserve for wrapped tokens. 1. Safeguard Smart Contract Functions A robust and decentralized reserve data feed gives bridge developers the tools to build automatic fail-safe measures that can halt the minting, redeeming, and burning of a wrapped token. For example, one way to help protect against infinite mint attacks is to use Chainlink Proof of Reserve data feeds to check if there is an equal or greater amount of reserves than wrapped tokens. If there aren’t, the minting of additional wrapped tokens is reverted. Because on-chain reserve data from Chainlink Proof of Reserve can help serve as a critical fail-safe in case of a bridge exploit or hack, it’s important that data feeds are secure, reliable, and accurate even in outlier circumstances. By leveraging a decentralized, Sybil-resistant network of nodes run by proven node operators, Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides best-in-class cross-chain reserve verification services, with updates reliably posted on-chain regardless of market or network conditions. By integrating Chainlink Proof of Reserve directly into a wrapped token smart contract, wrapped asset issuers can build in contingencies in case of an exploit or hack. 2. Enable Automatic DeFi Responses Robust on-chain proof of reserves surrounding wrapped tokens through Chainlink PoR enables DeFi developers to build in protections against potential bridge hacks or exploits. This helps mitigate DeFi contagion risk, and as more DeFi protocols implement these failsafe measures, ecosystem resiliency and anti-reflexivity will grow. For example, DeFi lending protocols could add circuit breakers that automatically pause lending pools using wrapped assets as collateral by reading data from Chainlink PoR data feeds. If there aren’t enough reserves locked on the source blockchain, the DeFi lending protocol can then automatically halt operations to reduce the severity of the event. A good proof of reserves solution for wrapped token assets makes it easy for DeFi developers to leverage the data for this exact reason. To lower the bar for implementations, reserve data feeds should be simple to implement, use a standardized solution, and be posted natively on-chain. As the industry-standard oracle solution for DeFi protocols, with over five billion data points delivered to blockchains, Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables DeFi developers to easily integrate reserve data into their dApp in just three steps. DeFi protocols integrating wrapped tokens can use Proof of Reserve to help protect against a cross-chain bridge hack or exploit at the protocol level. 3. Provide Users With Transparency Around Cross-Chain Collateral Automating data delivery on cross-chain reserves enables users to seamlessly verify the collateral backing of a wrapped token and quickly make informed decisions during outlier events—a key competitive edge for wrapped asset issuers looking to gain user adoption. Without proof of reserves, it can be difficult for users to verify on-chain that wrapped assets correspond on a one-to-one basis with assets on the source blockchain. One key consideration is that exploits or hacks can happen quickly. Reserve data feeds should be designed to update on-chain in near real-time to give users maximum transparency into the state of the cross-chain bridge, particularly when it’s most needed. That’s why Chainlink Proof of Reserve checks token reserves off-chain at regular intervals and updates the reserve data on-chain when it reaches a deviation threshold or heartbeat trigger, helping ensure real-time updates during unexpected events while saving on gas costs when reserves remain stable. Chainlink Proof of Reserve simplifies the reserve verification process by reliably delivering reserve data on the destination chain. Conclusion Bringing reserve data to blockchains provides crucial protection for cross-chain token bridges by enabling anyone to independently verify the collateral backing a wrapped token and projects to integrate automate failsafes in the event of a hack or exploit.

    "summary": "Learn how to automate your smart contracts using Chainlink Automation with this step-by-step guide and open up a huge range of use cases.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are not self-executing, meaning they require an externally owned account, oracle, or contract to trigger their own functions. This creates a problem for many dApps that require their smart contracts to execute at regular time intervals (e.g. every 24 hours), when predefined conditions are met (e.g. Ethereum hitting a specific price), or following a computation (e.g. a loan is calculated to be undercollateralized). In the past, developers would solve this problem by creating and maintaining their own centralized scripts to trigger their smart contracts, or trigger them manually. However, this effectively undermines the purpose of building a decentralized blockchain application, and opens up the possibility of downtime if the centralized script or manual triggering process fails. In this tutorial you will learn how to use Chainlink Automation to trigger smart contract execution in a reliable, automatic, and decentralized manner. Why Use Decentralized Automation To Trigger a Smart Contract? Chainlink Automation unlocks a new way to trigger smart contract execution in a decentralized manner, enabling developers to transform the way they build and maintain dApps. There are three main benefits to decentralized smart contact automation. Firstly, it is essential to remove any centralized points of failure in your operations. Chainlink Automation is powered by a decentralized network of nodes—the same hyper-reliable nodes that currently secure tens of billions in value across DeFi via Chainlink Data Feeds—removing centralized points of failure. Secondly, rather than investing time and resources in creating scripts for on-chain monitoring and triggering smart contract execution, developers can plug into Chainlink Automation’s optimized infrastructure by simply creating an Automation-compatible contract and registering it. This saves time, reduces the DevOps workload, and allows developers to focus on writing more great code. Lastly, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can enhance the security of their protocol. Developers no longer have to risk exposing their own private key when initiating transactions from centralized servers—the nodes on the Chainlink Automation Network will sign on-chain transactions. Get Started With Chainlink Automation You can automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation in two steps: Create and deploy an Automation-compatible contract Register the contract on the Chainlink Automation app to create an Upkeep After these steps have been completed, Chainlink Automation will perform the Upkeep job as specified without any further input. If you are new to Solidity, we recommend following some of the beginner tutorials before continuing. This tutorial is particularly comprehensive and useful. We will now show you how to make your contract Automation-compatible. If you prefer watching a video on the topic please watch our video tutorial. How To Create Automated Triggers for Smart Contracts To create an automated trigger for smart contract execution, you need to write an Automation-compatible smart contract. Automation-compatible contracts have a checkUpkeep function and a performUpkeep function with the required inputs and outputs expected by Chainlink Automation. To help prevent errors we will use the Automation-compatible interface before we specify what our check and perform functions should do. Importing the Automation-Compatible Interface Start by importing the KeeperCompatibleInterface into your contract. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\n// KeeperCompatible.sol imports the functions from both ./KeeperBase.sol and\r\n// ./interfaces/KeeperCompatibleInterface.sol\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/KeeperCompatible.sol\"; There are two functions to this interface: The checkUpkeep Function Chainlink Automation uses a decentralized network to monitor the checkUpkeep function securely and cost-efficiently off-chain during every block and then initiates an on-chain transaction to execute the smart contract function when predefined conditions are met. function checkUpkeep(\r\n  bytes calldata checkData\r\n)\r\n  external\r\n  returns (\r\n    bool upkeepNeeded,\r\n    bytes memory performData\r\n  ); The checkUpkeep function takes a bytes parameter named checkData that is set when you register your Upkeep on the Automation app. This value is optional and can be used in your logic to determine if checkUpkeep returns true. checkUpkeep returns a bool called upkeepNeeded. When true, this will call performUpkeep. It also returns performData in Bytes format (optional additional data) that the Automation Node should call performUpkeep with if Upkeep is needed. For more information, see the Developer Documentation. The performUpkeep Function If the off-chain simulation of your checkUpkeep confirms your predefined conditions are met (upkeepNeeded \u003d\u003d true from checkUpkeep), the Automation Node will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain executing the performUpkeep with performData as an input. function performUpkeep(\r\n  bytes calldata performData\r\n) external; A rotating node selection process prevents gas price auction wars between nodes and stabilizes costs of automating your contracts. Here is an example contract snippet from Chainlink Automation user Entropyfi where checkUpkeep checks whether the Entropyfi prediction game is due for settlement. /**\r\n* @dev chainlink keeper checkUpkeep function to constantly check whether we need function call\r\n**/\r\nfunction checkUpkeep(bytes calldata checkData) external override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {\r\n     PoolStatus currState \u003d status.currState;\r\n     uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp \u003d status.lastUpdateTimestamp;\r\n     uint256 durationOfGame \u003d status.durationOfGame;\r\n     uint256 durationOfBidding \u003d status.durationOfBidding;\r\n\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Accepting \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfBidding)) {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d true;\r\n     } else if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Locked \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfGame)) {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d true;\r\n     } else {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d false;\r\n     }\r\n     performData \u003d checkData;\r\n} Chainlink Automation Nodes will constantly call the checkUpkeep function, and if the upkeepNeeded is evaluated to true, then the nodes will execute the performUpkeep function. /**\r\n* @dev once checkUpKeep been triggered, keeper will call performUpKeep\r\n**/\r\nfunction performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {\r\n     PoolStatus currState \u003d status.currState;\r\n     uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp \u003d status.lastUpdateTimestamp;\r\n     uint256 durationOfGame \u003d status.durationOfGame;\r\n     uint256 durationOfBidding \u003d status.durationOfBidding;\r\n\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Accepting \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfBidding)) {\r\n          startGame();\r\n     }\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Locked \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfGame)) {\r\n          endGame();\r\n     }\r\n     performData;\r\n} Start With Some Sample Code Whether you are creating a new contract or already have a contract deployed that contains a function that needs to be automated there are guides to help you get started in the Chainlink Automation Developer Documentation. Start with the example contract here. The example below represents a simple counter contract. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.7.0;\r\n\r\n// KeeperCompatible.sol imports the functions from both ./KeeperBase.sol and\r\n// ./interfaces/KeeperCompatibleInterface.sol\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.7/KeeperCompatible.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Counter is KeeperCompatibleInterface {\r\n    /**\r\n    * Public counter variable\r\n    */\r\n    uint public counter;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n    * Use an interval in seconds and a timestamp to slow execution of Upkeep\r\n    */\r\n    uint public immutable interval;\r\n    uint public lastTimeStamp;\r\n\r\n    constructor(uint updateInterval) {\r\n      interval \u003d updateInterval;\r\n      lastTimeStamp \u003d block.timestamp;\r\n\r\n      counter \u003d 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata /* checkData */) external override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory /* performData */) {\r\n        upkeepNeeded \u003d (block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) \u003e interval;\r\n        // We don\u0027t use the checkData in this example. The checkData is defined when the Upkeep was registered.\r\n    }\r\n    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external override {\r\n        //We highly recommend revalidating the upkeep in the performUpkeep function\r\n        if ((block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) \u003e interval ) {\r\n            lastTimeStamp \u003d block.timestamp;\r\n            counter \u003d counter + 1;\r\n        }\r\n        // We don\u0027t use the performData in this example. The performData is generated by the Keeper\u0027s call to your checkUpkeep function\r\n    }\r\n} There are a huge range of possible triggers for smart contract automation. Chainlink Automation can monitor the state of any on-chain or off-chain condition, such as the passage of time (e.g. did 24 hours pass?) or a computation (e.g. is the loan calculated to be undercollateralized?). Once a condition is met, Automation nodes submit a transaction on-chain to trigger the smart contract to execute. You can also start with a Chainlink Automation utility contract such as the EthBalanceMonitor contract or these examples. How to Register Your Contract as an Upkeep on the Network Once you have your Automation-compatible contract, head over to the Chainlink Automation app and click “Register new Upkeep”. For a detailed step-by-step guide on how to register, see the Chainlink Developer Documentation. Important note (for non-ETH chains): your Upkeep must be funded with ERC-677 LINK (not ERC-20, which is common across many token bridges). Use PegSwap to make your LINK tokens ERC-677 compatible. Once registered and approved, you can add additional funds and see all the details for your Upkeep on the Chainlink Automation app. Get Started Today Now that you know how easy it is to automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation, you can get started with integrating Chainlink Automation and unlock a huge range of use cases, such as DEX limit orders, cross-chain NFT minting, rebasing and rebalancing tokens, and much more.

    "content": "Blockchains are a radical new computing model where data and applications are secured not by centralized intermediaries but by a decentralized network of computers. Due to their permissionless nature, blockchains enable anyone to opt-in and begin independently verifying the integrity of computations, resulting in a checks and balances system between users and network operators. From the creation of new digital currencies with programmatic monetary policies (e.g. Bitcoin) to the execution of programmable trust-minimized applications (e.g. Ethereum), blockchains are rapidly entering the public consciousness as a new form of digital infrastructure, often referred to as Web3. However, while the overarching value proposition of blockchains is recognized by many, the nuances regarding the underlying trust model of blockchains are often misunderstood. This article will serve to explain how the trust model of blockchains differs from traditional computing by looking at the role of self-verifying full nodes, with particular reference to how they keep block producers (e.g. miners/validators) accountable and how decreasing the cost of verification is at the heart of blockchain scalability. The Limitations of Traditional Computing Models The computing model used by most applications today involves a client-server model where requests are sent to a centralized database server. The participants within the traditional computing model can be broken down into the following: Clients: End-users who generate requests, often via a personal device, which are sent to a centralized database server over the Internet via TCP/IP and await a response. Clients trust the database server to faithfully respond to requests. Database Servers: A remote computer, often in the form of a centralized cloud provider, that provides information or access to particular services. The backend database server is often a collection of computers which a traditional institution centrally manages. In the traditional computing model, users must trust an opaque centralized database. Often referred to as “Web2,” this computing model empowers developers to quickly launch and scale applications on-demand. Users are also provided with a seamless user experience due to low-latency and high-throughput computation facilitated by data centers. While applications hosted on centralized databases provide immense value to billions of users around the world, they carry certain limitations. Most notably, end-users have no way to verify that the computation involved in producing a response to a request is legitimate or that the database entries have not been manipulated over time. Such applications effectively operate in a black box, meaning users must fully trust that third-party intermediates will act in their best interests. The trust assumptions associated with centrally hosted applications can negatively impact users, who can experience financial censorship, social media deplatforming, leaks of their personal data, manipulative content selection algorithms, increased reconciliation costs, corrupted data and data loss, and an overall lack of accountability. The end result is a breakdown in societal trust and an increase in the cost of economic coordination. The Blockchain Computing Model Rather than trusting the good faith of centralized intermediaries, blockchains introduce trust-minimization and credible neutrality by using: Cryptography to authenticate data/asset ownership and validate transaction integrity; Decentralized consensus to establish the ordering of transactions and enforce the protocol’s rules; Financial incentives to ensure the immutability of the network’s ledger and its ongoing operation. Importantly, blockchains are open networks—anyone in the world can join as either an active contributor or a passive listener. This allows end-users to verify for themselves that any output produced by the network is valid and that ledger entries have not been tampered with. The transparency of blockchains also mitigates risks around opacity, eliminating information asymmetry and ensuring information regarding risk exposure is available to all participants. In the blockchain computing model, end-users can opt-in to join the network and verify the computations being performed. The Different Roles of Blockchain Participants To ensure the proper operation of a blockchain, there are various (often overlapping) categories of network participants that each play a crucial role. Block Producers (BPs): Entities responsible for ordering and packaging transactions into discrete data structures called blocks which are then proposed to the network to validate. If two valid blocks are produced at the same block height, BPs are responsible for determining which version of the chain is canonical (e.g. longest chain rule). A consensus algorithm is used to determine which BP is responsible for generating the next block in the chain of blocks, with Proof of Work (miners) and Proof of Stake (validators) being the two most popular models. Full Nodes: The heart of a blockchain network. Full nodes download and self-verify each block proposed by BPs. If the block is found to be valid (i.e. protocol rules have been followed), then the block is added to the full node’s personal copy of the ledger and state changes are applied. Any invalid blocks not in line with the protocol’s rules are ignored and consequently discarded without any state changes occurring. Archive Nodes: Entities that store all of the same information as full nodes but also compute and store previous states of a blockchain. Archive nodes are useful for querying arbitrary historical data, such as a user’s account balance at a specific block height in the past. Note that a full node can be converted into an archive node at any time without having to download any extra information from the network. Archive nodes typically have high hardware requirements and are commonly run by service providers (e.g. block explorers). Light Clients: A limited form of a full node where only the headers (i.e. small unique cryptographic fingerprints) of blocks are downloaded. Light clients can verify a transaction was included within a block, but because they do not download or execute all transactions within blocks, they implicitly trust that the majority of block producers are honest. Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, were first described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. RPC Providers: Full nodes that facilitate read/write access to a blockchain that other network participants connect to. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are often used by those who do not or cannot run their own full node or light client, significantly reducing the friction of accessing a blockchain. Any user connected to an RPC provider implicitly trusts the honesty of the provider as no self-verification work is done. End-users: The average user who wants to make transactions on a blockchain network. This category can include participants who run a full node or light client, as well as those connected to an RPC provider. Blockchains exist to serve the end-users, otherwise there is no other reason for the network to exist. While each of these network participants plays a key role in blockchain ecosystems, full nodes operate at the heart of a blockchain network as they are the entities responsible for maintaining full replicas of the network’s ledger. Other network participants, such as block producers and light clients, connect to full nodes to stay informed on the state of the network. The resulting network topography is illustrated below. The topography of a blockchain network, where light clients and BPs are connected to full nodes. The Limited Powers of Block Producers A common misconception about blockchains is that since block producers are responsible for generating new blocks containing transactions, then they must unilaterally control a blockchain. Put another way, the belief is that if a majority of BPs are corrupted/colluding (commonly known as a 51% attack), then the network is wholly compromised and everything of value can be irrevocably destroyed. In reality, BPs have a limited scope of power, where only specific types of malicious activity can take place. What block producers can do: Censor Transactions: Individual BPs determine which transactions are included in blocks they create, allowing them to selectively ignore specific transactions. While colluding BPs can prevent transactions from being included in blocks they create, there only needs to be one honest BP in order for a transaction to be included within a valid block. Rewrite the Chain: If the majority of BPs collude (e.g. a 51% attack), then previously created valid blocks can be forked out of the network through a process called block reorganization (reorg), where a new chain of blocks becomes the canonical chain. Note that some blockchains have a notion of “economic finality” via a checkpoint system, with reorgs of blocks older than the checkpoint resulting in a chain halt which requires resolution via social consensus. A block reorg reverts previously accepted valid blocks with a new set of valid blocks. What block producers cannot do: Change the Protocol’s Rules: BPs cannot arbitrarily change the protocol’s rules such as adding/removing functionalities (e.g. opcodes), increasing/decreasing the maximum allowed block size or block time interval, or increasing/decreasing the block rewards issued for producing blocks. Steal User Funds: BPs cannot spend coins/tokens from addresses for which they do not have the private key, as the cryptographic signatures of such transactions would be invalid. Note that while chain reorgs can lead to double-spend attacks, this involves simply removing a transaction from the chain’s ledger that was signed by the private key holder, not falsifying a transaction signature. To understand why the power of BPs is inherently limited, it is important to understand the relationship between BPs and self-verifying full nodes. How Full Nodes Keep Block Producers Accountable While BPs ensure the liveness of a blockchain by proposing new blocks, they do not determine the validity of blocks on behalf of the network. Rather, it is the role of full nodes—which store a personal copy of the blockchain’s ledger—to independently validate each block and execute all the transactions contained within to determine whether the protocol’s rules are being followed. The result is a checks and balances system where full nodes hold BPs accountable by only accepting valid blocks and ignoring blocks that do not conform to the protocol rules. As such, BPs are economically incentivized to only produce valid blocks, as otherwise they would waste economic resources by producing invalid blocks and forfeit any block reward and transaction fees they could have earned. Even if other BPs build valid blocks on top of an invalid block, these blocks will all be ignored by full nodes, resulting in such BPs effectively forking themselves off the network. Full nodes are operated by key economic actors within a blockchain’s ecosystem, including cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoin issuers, oracles, layer-2 validators, RPC providers, custody wallet providers, large crypto asset holders, and average users alike. By self-verifying a blockchain’s ledger, these key economic actors cannot be tricked into accepting invalid blocks. Full nodes do not need to coordinate/communicate with each other to determine if a block is valid either. Rather, by following the protocol’s rules when checking blocks, they will all arrive at the same conclusion regarding block validity. Invalid blocks are rejected by full nodes which continue to follow the valid chain of blocks. With many blockchains, the protocol rules are determined by the community off-chain in a process known as social consensus. This typically involves a formalized process (e.g. Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs), where the community debates the merits of any protocol rule change on various social channels. Once rough off-chain consensus is achieved, blockchain core developers write a new version of the blockchain software client, which implements these changes. Full nodes and BPs can then choose whether or not to run this new software to upgrade the network via a hard fork (non-backward-compatible change) or a soft fork (backward-compatible change). If a hard fork upgrade is contentious, then the network may experience a chain split where two different versions of a blockchain are created and individually maintained. Once a split occurs, each blockchain will have a shared history from the genesis block up to the specific block height at which the split occurred. This was seen with the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, when differences arose on how to scale transaction throughput. It was also seen in the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic hard fork in 2016, when differences arose on how to handle The DAO hack. Bitcoin Cash was a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that arose around differences in how to scale transaction throughput. (source) In contrast to off-chain consensus, other blockchains have chosen to handle upgrades via on-chain governance, with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by token-holders determining protocol rule changes. Either method of facilitating protocol upgrades presents its own unique benefits and challenges, and the method used depends on the needs of the community. Low Hardware Requirements for Full Nodes If the hardware requirements for operating a full node are too high (e.g. non-consumer hardware is required), then fewer entities will be capable of or willing to run a full node, instead, relying on centralized solutions to read/write to the blockchain. This can result in a blockchain network becoming more vulnerable to exploitation from BPs. To support a healthy network of full nodes, many blockchains purposely limit the transaction throughput of the network to that of the lowest spec computer that the community desires to self-verify the ledger. Low hardware requirements not only help those who wish to run a full node during normal operations, but also make it easier to spin up a new self-verifying full node if the blockchain is actively being attacked by a colluding group of BPs. The exact hardware requirements necessary to stay fully synchronized to the network vary from blockchain to blockchain, however, a common target goal is average consumer hardware. An example of a Bitcoin full node running on a Raspberry Pi, a low-spec microcomputer. (source) The following logic describes how low hardware requirements lead to the core value proposition of blockchains: Low hardware requirements → low cost to verify blocks → more entities can run full nodes → stronger resistance to BP attacks → increased network security → superior credible neutrality → increased adoption While the minimum hardware requirements capable of running a full node are not explicitly defined in the rules of a blockchain protocol (improvements in hardware/software efficiency is perpetually occurring), the transaction throughput rules of a blockchain (commonly determined by the size and frequency of blocks) are tuned to target a specific range of device specifications. Although targeting average consumer hardware is a common approach, some blockchains opt to target beefier server-grade hardware as the minimum hardware requirements for verification in order to increase transaction throughput. This comes with the acknowledgment that while fewer entities may be able to self-verify the ledger using self-hosted equipment, a sufficient number of key economic actors may still have the resources necessary to run a full node. Reducing the Costs of Blockchain Verification Everyone in the world running their own full node to self-verify a blockchain is an idealistic goal. However, in practice, the time and resources required to spin up a full node may introduce too much friction for many end-users. As blockchains become more widely adopted, users familiar with trusting centralized service providers may find the process of setting up a full node too cumbersome, and would rather be able to immediately start interacting with on-chain applications. As a result, most end-users of widely used blockchains today do not run their own full node, but rather connect to and implicitly trust RPC providers to relay transactions to the network and inform them on the current state of a blockchain. Such users may not enjoy the full self-verification benefits of blockchains and the security of the network is not as strong as it could be, however, it is still an order of magnitude improvement in trust-minimization over traditional computing models. Many end-users today do not run a full node but rather connect to and trust an RPC provider. (source) A middle-ground solution to this problem could entail the integration of light clients into blockchain wallets. While this would be an improvement over the status quo by reducing trust in RPC providers, light clients still implicitly trust that the majority of BPs are producing valid blocks and that all of the transaction data within a block has been made publicly available. In order for light clients to verify the work of BPs without simply downloading and executing the entire block (i.e. running a full node), technical improvements in light client implementations can increase their trust-minimization properties, resulting in what can be considered “trust-minimized light clients”. These technical improvements can include: Fraud Proofs: A cryptographic proof generated by full nodes that can be sent to light clients to prove that a block is invalid and violates the protocol’s rules without the light client needing to re-execute the entire block. Validity Proofs: An alternative to fraud proofs where a zero-knowledge proof is generated, allowing block producers to directly prove to light clients that blocks are valid and follow the protocol’s rules. Data Availability Sampling (DAS): A probabilistic sampling technique that verifies that all of the data in a block has been made available to the network without light clients needing to download the entire block. Trust-minimized light clients verify the work of block producers without downloading or executing an entire block. (source) As additional trust-minimization techniques are created and deployed successfully in production, the cost and friction of verifying the work of block producers without downloading and executing entire blocks improve, leading to more secure blockchain networks. Notably, the methods of creating trust-minimized light clients can even enable more scalable blockchain networks to emerge. Scaling Blockchains While Retaining Self-Verification Scaling a blockchain is commonly thought of as being equivalent to increasing transaction throughput. However, a more holistic interpretation would be increasing transaction throughput while maintaining a low verification cost. Thanks to the properties of trust-minimized light clients, the throughput of a blockchain network can be increased (e.g. increasing block size and/or block interval time) yet still retain the low verification costs required to keep BPs accountable. Furthermore, layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups leverage similar techniques as trust-minimized light clients by using cryptographic proofs to prove transaction validity without the blockchain network needing to execute every transaction. In this case, the blockchain operates an enshrined trust-minimized light client for the layer-2 rollup. Combined with transaction batching and storage of transaction data on-chain for data availability, transaction throughput can be increased by multiple orders of magnitude with minimal to no additional verification costs imposed on the underlying blockchain. Layer-2 rollups use a blockchain as an enshrined trust-minimized light client to increase transaction throughput. (source) Conclusion Blockchain are highly secure, credibly neutral, and transparent append-only ledgers that offer a new paradigm for computing. By incorporating a checks and balances system between block producers and full nodes, a blockchain can serve the needs of its community and evolve over time while also remaining resistant to manipulation. While more work needs to be done to lower verification costs, blockchains in their current state still offer an order of magnitude increase in trust-minimization over traditional computing models. — The opinions expressed within this post are solely the author’s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.

    "content": "Fundamentally, contracts define the terms and obligations for an exchange of value between two or more independent parties. Historically, a centralized arbitrator is usually required to verify if those terms and conditions are met. However, thanks to the advent of blockchain technology and smart contract applications, we can now replace centralized arbitrators with decentralized infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving operational efficiency. However, due to the consensus mechanisms of blockchains, smart contracts have no built-in capabilities for interacting with external resources like data providers and API services as a means of verifying the outcome of real-world events happening outside the blockchain. This creates what is known as the blockchain oracle problem and represents one of the greatest limitations to representing everyday contracts on the blockchain. To overcome this lack of connectivity, hybrid smart contracts use oracles as middleware to retrieve external data inputs, push data outputs to external systems, and perform scalable off-chain computations. Not only do oracles serve as a two-way bridge between smart contracts and the outside world, but they also provide a security framework for protecting against any single point of failure such as data manipulation and downtime. The Chainlink Network connects smart contracts to off-chain data and events Chainlink is the most widely used decentralized oracle network, currently securing tens of billions in USD value for live applications across numerous blockchains and use cases. Chainlink is not a single oracle network but an ecosystem consisting of numerous decentralized oracle networks running in parallel. Each oracle network can provide a multitude of oracle services without cross dependencies on other oracle networks, some of which include: Decentralized Price Feeds that can be integrated in any DeFi application to obtain access to a high-quality, tamper-resistant, and fresh source of financial market data on a wide range of assets with full market coverage. A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) providing NFTs and on-chain gaming applications a provably fair and secure Random Number Generator (RNG) purpose-built for smart contract applications. Proof of Reserve (PoR) enabling smart contracts to audit the true collateralization of any on-chain asset backed by off-chain reserves such as fiat-backed stablecoins, cross-chain tokens, tokenized assets, and more. Automation providing dApp developers a reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient transaction execution service for triggering smart contract functions and performing contract maintenance by leveraging off-chain computation. Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard for the multi-chain ecosystem, enabling cross-chain applications that can send messages and transfer tokens with commands across multiple blockchains. Modular External Adapters for connecting to any off-chain resource including premium data providers, authenticated web APIs, IoT sensors, bank payments, enterprise backends, other blockchain networks, and more. Off-Chain Computation such as Fair Sequencing Services for transaction ordering, DECO for privacy-preserving attestations of TLS web session data, Arbitrum Rollups for scalable off-chain Solidity computation, and more. Chainlink is a heterogeneous oracle network consisting of many oracle network models Ultimately, Chainlink provides the necessary developer tools required to construct any type of oracle network, such as using multiple data sources, multiple oracle nodes, various aggregation methods, payment penalties, reputation services, and visualization tools. This allows for a wide range of use cases to be developed, tested, and pushed into production. Access to external data opens up a whole new wave of functionality for smart contracts. To inspire you with the limitless potential of universally connected smart contracts, we put together a list of 77+ ways to use the Chainlink Network. If any of these ideas resonate with you or if you want to learn more, find us on Discord or Github, and check out our documentation to begin building universally connected smart contracts today. Decentralized Finance Money is the common medium used today to value and exchange assets. Financial products provide different vehicles in which people can maximize the value of their money via different strategies like hedging, speculating, earning interest, collateralizing loans, and more. However, traditional finance is often gated, wherein well-capitalized entities have disproportionate control over the issuance of money and the creation/offering and settlement of financial products. The result is a lack of universal accessibility to certain financial products and the introduction of counterparty risk, where the larger entity has more influence on whether the financial product is fairly honored according to the pre-agreed upon terms. Blockchains and smart contracts bring deterministic execution to financial products, eliminate moats around financial product creation, and provide tamper-proof monetary policy for on-chain assets. Chainlink oracles play a critical role in creating advanced smart contracts representing financial products and monetary instruments, particularly those that execute based on market data like FX rates, interest rates, asset prices, indices, and more. Money Markets Blockchain-based money markets are crucial financial infrastructure that use smart contracts to connect lenders, who wish to earn yield on their assets, with borrowers, who wish to gain access to working capital. They allow users to increase the utility of their crypto holdings and participate in both the supply side and the demand side. However, to ensure the solvency of the platform, price feeds are required to track the valuation of assets used on the platform as a means of ensuring loans are issued at fair market prices and liquidations automatically occur on undercollateralized loans. Aave, Compound, and Liquity are examples of on-chain money markets protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch market data for dozens of different on-chain cryptocurrencies. With this real-time pricing data, these lending/borrowing protocols can calculate the valuation of each user’s collateral and debt in order to determine when liquidations should be initiated. This ensures the money market protocols are always sufficiently collateralized, protecting tens of billions of USD value in user deposits. Aave uses Chainlink Price Feeds to ensure proper collateralization Decentralized Stablecoins Stablecoins are on-chain tokens that are pegged 1:1 to fiat currency, commonly the US dollar. They provide users with the ability to hold a non-volatile cryptocurrency. While centralized stablecoins are backed by fiat in an off-chain bank account, decentralized stablecoins are commonly overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrencies and require price data to maintain full collateralization (e.g. a user’s collateral is worth over 150% the value of their loan). DeFiDollar is an example of a decentralized meta-stablecoin (a stablecoin backed by multiple stablecoins) that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of the underlying assets including sUSD, USDT, DAI, and USDC. In the event that one or multiple of these tokens deviate from their 1:1 USD peg, thus causing DUSD to also lose its peg, a rebalance is triggered between the four reserves in order to preserve the dollar parity of DUSD. DeFiDollar uses Chainlink Price Feeds for valuation data on the stablecoins backing DUSD Algorithmic Stablecoins Similar to centralized stablecoins collateralized by dollars in a bank account or decentralized stablecoins overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrency, algorithmic stablecoins aim to maintain a peg equivalent to another currency like USD. However, unlike other implementations, algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg using automated rewards and penalties to drive the price towards the peg, often by burning the stablecoin when under its peg (deflation) and minting more stablecoins when over its peg (inflation). Fei Protocol is an example of an algorithmic stablecoin that uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the reference to set the protocol-controlled value bonding curve for the FEI/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap to stabilize the peg of the FEI token. Through the market-wide pricing provided by the ETH/USD Price Feed, Fei Protocol can ensure the proper exchange rate is offered by the bonding curve. How the Fei Protocol uses Chainlink Price Feeds to stabilize the peg of its algorithmic stablecoin FEI Futures Futures are financial instruments that “obligate” traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Commonly used for hedging and leveraged exposure, futures smart contracts require users to collateralize their long or short position. Price feeds are used to determine whether or not liquidations should occur, ensuring each contract is fully collateralized at all times. Lyra and MCDEX are examples of on-chain financial applications that utilize Chainlink Price Feeds in order to power Perpetual Contracts, which is a Futures contract without expiry. By using Chainlink oracles, these protocols are able to ensure the solvency of their platform by having access to real-time price data for both determining when liquidations should occur and dynamically setting the funding rate to maintain net neutral exposure. Lyra uses the LINK/USD Price Feed to power the on-chain LINK-USD Perpetual Contract Options Similar to futures contracts, options are a type of financial derivative that grant traders the “option” to buy or sell a certain amount of a particular asset by a future date if they so choose. In the off-chain world, centralized entities most frequently underwrite the contracts, but on the blockchain, decentralized peer-to-peer options are possible. Opyn and Thales are examples of options protocols that use Chainlink Price Feeds to calculate the valuation of crypto assets, enabling users to mint, trade, and settle options contracts. Additionally, Chainlink oracle nodes like dxFeed provide Implied Volatility (IV) data on various crypto assets, granting contract creators the ability to calculate an option’s contract premium in a reliable and tamper-resistant manner. Opyn uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle options contracts Synthetic Assets Synthetic assets are a category of financial instruments that provide traders price exposure to specific assets, such as indices or commodities, without requiring ownership of the physical asset itself. Smart contract-based synthetic assets allow traders to create advanced non-custodial trading strategies and gain exposure to traditional assets that do not exist on the blockchain. Synthetix is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the minting of various “synths” that allow traders to gain on-chain exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, indices, equities, and more. Through a peer-to-contract trading model, users are able to swap between these synthetic tokens with zero slippage using Chainlink Price Feeds to access the current value of the underlying assets. Synthetix uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the target peg for numerous synthetic assets Credit Default Swaps Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial agreements that allow lenders to hedge against the possible occurrence of a default (lack of payment) from a borrower. If the borrower goes into default, the party who issued and sold the Credit Default Swap reimburses the lender for the outstanding funds not paid by the borrower. Opium.Exchange is an example of an on-chain protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle various financial instrument products. One of these products includes a Credit Default Swap on the centralized stablecoin USDT Tether, allowing traders to hedge against Tether deviating and falling below its $1 peg. Bonds Bonds are a financial agreement that enables the raising of short-term capital by issuing debt to be paid back at a later date. Traditional bond contracts can be replicated as an automated smart contract through the use of Chainlink oracles, which provide the data required for settlement such as interest rates, debt scores, fiat payments, and more. Chainlink has already demonstrated such capability with a POC with SWIFT, where oracles were used to aggregate interest rates from five major banks, fetch debt score data from S\u0026P, and generate an interest payment in the form of an ISO20022 SWIFT payment message. As a multi-trillion dollar industry, bringing bonds onto the blockchain can greatly reduce counterparty risk and lower operational costs across the board. A smart contract bond using Chainlink oracles and SWIFT’s ISO20022 standard Tokenized Portfolio Management A unique use case for smart contracts is non-custodial “smart portfolios” that automatically rebalance user portfolios by executing trades on their behalf based on preset conditions. This provides users with advanced financial products that programmatically manage investments based on the current market-wide price of specific assets and tokens. These trading strategies can be tokenized, allowing users to transfer and use these tokens within other smart contract applications. Tokensets is one such example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to generate various “Sets,” tokenized positions that execute trades on the behalf of users. These Sets are based on Technical Analysis (TA) metrics such as the RSI or moving averages, designed to catch key price action trends. Additionally, users can use their Set tokens as collateral within other protocols, such as the Aave money market, to gain additional capital efficiency. Proof of On-Chain Reserve Wrapped cross-chain assets—cryptocurrencies/tokens native to one blockchain that are locked into a contract and then “unlocked” on another blockchain—are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to increase the collateral types available within the DeFi ecosystem. However, in order to ensure the integrity of DeFi applications supporting wrapped asset deposits, Proof of Reserve reference contracts can be used to supply data regarding the true collateralization of these on-chain assets. Two protocols using Chainlink to power Proof of Reserve reference feeds include BitGo’s WBTC and Ren Protocol’s renBTC, representing a large majority of the wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and representing billions in USD value. These Proof of Reserve reference feeds provide DeFi protocols with the data they need to autonomously verify collateral reserves and swiftly protect user funds during an undercollateralization event. Proof of Reserve reference feeds can also be used to track the collateralization of assets beyond cross-chain tokens including stablecoins and real-world commodities, further increasing the collateral available within DeFi. Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides smart contracts proof of the Bitcoin collateral backing BitGo’s Wrapped BTC (WBTC) Proof of Off-Chain Reserve Bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain provides a large potential to expand the economic activity of DeFi, as seen with the adoption of fiat-backed stablecoins. However, this requires the underlying collateral to be held by a central custodian, disconnecting the on-chain tokenized representation from the actual off-chain asset itself. Through Chainlink Proof of Reserve, smart contacts are able to autonomously audit the collateralization of real-world asset-backed tokens, protecting users during black swan events. Examples of this are the Paxos Proof of Reserve for PAX and PAXG as well as the TrustToken Proof of Reserve for TUSD. The latter provides DeFi applications with data regarding the true amount of US dollars backing the stablecoin TUSD held by TrustToken’s off-chain escrowed bank accounts as reviewed by Armanino, an independent top-25 auditing firm in the United States. This collateralization data can be checked against the total amount of circulating TUSD tokens on various blockchains, as reported by the complementary TUSD Proof of Supply feed, to determine the collateralization of TrustToken’s tokenized USD. TrustToken uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to provide smart contracts proof of the off-chain fiat reserves backing the TUSD stablecoin Automated Asset Management Smart contracts can be used to automatically execute trading strategies at predetermined intervals. However, a range of variables can influence the profitability of those strategies, specifically network gas costs. Thus, traders using automated systems need reliable data from oracles in order to ensure that their trades will be consistently profitable. Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation in its Pickle Jars product to help automatically manage capital-efficient LP positions across Uniswap v3. By automatically rebalancing users’ LP positions, Chainlink Automation helps ensure the positions remain in range and collect maximum LP fees—helping maximize returns for users. Revenue Sharing As an increasing number of DeFi products launch with DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, there becomes more of a need for developers and community members to distribute the revenue generated by a DeFi protocol in a decentralized and real-time manner. Through the usage of Chainlink oracles, DAOs can distribute crypto revenues proportionally according to various metrics, such as staked coins, governance participation, developer activity, or any customized set of requirements. Synthetix is one example of a DeFi protocol that will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards each week to users. Chainlink Automation will monitor the smart contract’s state off-chain and autonomously call the fee distribution function in the protocol’s feePools smart contract after the fee period duration has ended. Synthetix will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards to users Yield Farming Yield Farming is a new financial primitive within the DeFi ecosystem that is used to bootstrap liquidity and facilitate the fair distribution of a protocol’s governance tokens. In most yield farming applications, users who provide liquidity to a protocol are granted a reward in the form of its native governance token, serving as a growth subsidy. Two protocols using Chainlink oracles in their yield farming mechanisms are Plasm and StrongBlock. Plasm uses Chainlink price oracles to help determine the amount of value users have locked into the protocol and then distributes rewards accordingly, while StrongBlock calculates the USD value locked in Community pools once every 24 hours. StrongBlock uses Chainlink oracles to calculate staking rewards based on miner reliability Yield optimizing protocols automatically harvest and compound yield for their users. Users deposit tokens into a vault that automatically harvests yield at critical points to maximize compounding returns. However, as smart contracts cannot execute their own functions, yield optimizers need an external entity to trigger an on-chain transaction. Instead of depending on unreliable public bounties or centralized bots with a single point of failure to automate transactions, many yield optimizers use a trust-minimized solution. Chainlink Automation enables developers to trigger smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner, and has already powered tens of thousands of automated transactions across Web3. Developers can set them to autocompound yield at regular periods or build advanced optimization strategies that only execute when it’s profitable to do so. For example, the yield optimizer Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation to help yield aggregators build more advanced, fully automated vault strategies. With Chainlink Automation, Pickle Finance is able to increase rewards for depositors without relying on manual intervention or introducing a single point of failure would make its platform vulnerable to manipulation and technical failures. See how you can get started with Chainlink Automation or explore the docs. Leveraged Yield Farming Users can increase their yield and capital efficiency by using leveraged yield farming protocols that lend depositors capital through protocol-controlled undercollateralized loans. With these positions, borrowers can maximize the value of their assets through various yield farming strategies while lenders earn a passive income from borrowers who want to amplify their farming positions. This results in an application-specific money market specially focused around the activity of yield farming. Alpaca Finance is one example of a protocol using Chainlink Price Feeds to enable users to leverage up their positions on PancakeSwap and WaultSwap by borrowing capital to increase their positions. Financial market data from Price Feeds is used to calculate proper collateralization ratios during loan issuance and liquidate positions to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol, even during market volatility in the valuation of the collateral deposited by borrowers. Alpaca Finance uses Chainlink Price Feeds during the loan issuance and liquidation processes Cross-Chain Yield Farming As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand across a number of blockchain networks, the opportunity for generating yield from existing protocols like Aave will fractionalize across disconnected environments. In order to overcome this issue, a cross-chain token bridge is required to facilitate the transfer of user funds across networks. However, existing cross-chain solutions are vulnerable to exploitation, with hundreds of millions of dollars already having been siphoned from such protocols. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a secure open-source standard for transferring messages and tokens across blockchain networks, overcomes these issues and will provide developers with the tamper-resistant infrastructure required to create multi-chain yield earning platforms. Self-Paying Loans As a new DeFi-enabled financial primitive, self-paying loan protocols enable users to deposit assets as collateral and borrow/mint synthetic assets to provide working capital. The deposited collateral is routed to a yield-generating protocol, where the yield is used to automatically pay down the debt over time, creating a highly capital-efficient borrowing position. One implementation of this new financial primitive is Alchemix, a self-paying loan protocol that uses Chainlink Automation to provide users an advance on their future yield over time for deposits of DAI and ETH. Automation is used to trigger vault harvesting and vault flushing each day, automating debt repayment and reallocating new depositing into Yearn Finance to generate yield. Circuit Breaker In certain instances of exceptionally high volatility, the prices for assets on a cryptocurrency exchange may cease to reflect the prices seen on the wider market. This can lead to a loss of funds to arbitrageurs, or to users getting wrongly liquidated due to leveraged positions they had open. Such occurrences can reduce user trust in an exchange. Exchanges can benefit from using a circuit breaker that trips should certain deviations occur. Digitex is an example of a traditional exchange that protects users from market manipulation by monitoring for deviation between their internal price feeds and Chainlink Price Feeds as an additional layer of security for users trading on the platform. If the exchange’s price deviates beyond a certain percentage from the wider market price reported by Chainlink oracles, a “circuit breaker” can be triggered to temporarily halt trading and liquidations. Decentralized Exchange Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are on-chain trading venues that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without taking custody of those assets or giving out personal information to a centralized institution. As DEXs grow in popularity, the desire for traditional trading strategies and advanced features currently available on traditional centralized exchanges grows in importance. 0x Relayer Bamboo Relay is an example of a decentralized exchange that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss order functionalities—conditional trading functions based on the price action of an asset. With aggregated market data from Chainlink, each trader’s stop-loss order will only be executed when the market-wide price of the asset surpasses a certain predefined threshold, preventing market manipulation attacks from falsely executing trades. Bamboo Relay uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss orders on top of the 0x protocol Automated Market Makers Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are an increasingly popular category of decentralized exchanges. Instead of traditional order books, AMMs are on-chain liquidity pools that facilitate asset swaps based on a predetermined price formula. By pooling capital, liquidity providers are able to earn passive yield and traders gain access to on-demand liquidity. DODO is an example of an AMM protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power a new AMM design known as a Proactive Market Maker. DODO’s PMM mimics human market-making behaviors and gathers more capital near the market price reported by Chainlink in order to facilitate more efficient and frequent trading. Staking Many protocols rely on some form of staking—the locking of cryptocurrency collateral into a smart contract—in order to secure their crypto-economic networks. Staked collateral might help signal where rewards should be proportionally distributed, or it can be “slashed”—programmatically taken under certain conditions as a means of disincentivizing malicious behaviors. For instance, AdEx requires its validator nodes to stake collateral and maintain high availability. AdEx uses Chainlink oracles to monitor node uptime and trigger the slashing of collateral should any node fall below the uptime requirements. This ensures that only high-quality node operators participate in the network, which in turn enhances the security of the entire platform. Rebasing Rebasing is a new financial primitive within DeFi that involves the act of adjusting the supply of a token as a means to maintain its peg to a specific reference asset, such as the US dollar. If the price of the token is above its peg during the rebase, then more tokens are minted and given proportionally to all token holders with the goal of lowering the per token price. Conversely, if the price of the token is below the peg, then a certain percentage of each holder’s tokens are burned to raise the per token price. Ampleforth is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power its native rebasing functionality. The total supply of AMPL is rebased on a daily basis to track the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate, an index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the current value of the inflation-adjusted 2019 US dollar. Both the volume-weighted average price of AMPL and the CPI index are provided to the Ampleforth protocol by Chainlink oracles. Ampleforth uses Chainlink oracles to rebase the AMPL token supply every 24 hours Real-World Assets As discussed in our recent education piece, tokenized real-world assets are among the most promising use cases for blockchain and smart contract technology. They take real-world assets and represent them on the blockchain as a token. Compared to traditional assets, tokenized assets benefit from global accessibility, permissionless liquidity, on-chain transparency, and reduced transactional friction. Liquidations Blockchain money markets are commonly overcollateralized to ensure user loans can be properly liquidated when the collateral drops in value and/or the debt rises in value, thereby keeping user funds in the market safe. However, because smart contracts are “asleep” by default, liquidations need to be performed by an external party to “wake up” the contract to close a position by paying down the debt. The process needs to be highly reliable to ensure no toxic loan positions on created and left open. Aave is one example of a money market protocol with tens of billions of dollars in user deposits that will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of user positions. Chainlink Automation will monitor the collateralization ratio of user positions, and if any position falls below the predefined threshold of the collateral (e.g. 150%), the decentralized Chainlink Automation Network will call the liquidation function and close the position, even during heavy market volatility and blockchain network congestion. Aave will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of undercollateralized loans. External Payments It’s easy for smart contracts to issue payments in the cryptocurrency of their native blockchain, such as Ethereum smart contracts issuing payments in ETH, for example. However, many businesses can’t afford the risk of holding volatile cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheet. They also don’t want the additional friction of trading out cryptocurrency for their preferred fiat currency. Given the wide variety of payment preferences around the world, smart contracts need access to many types of payment options to adequately service global demand. Chainlink can facilitate a wide variety of payment services thanks to its ability to push outputs from smart contracts to external APIs. Chainlink connects blockchains to external payment solutions Bank Payments Chainlink enables smart contracts to connect to existing banking systems, allowing smart contract developers to seamlessly integrate information and services such as consumer bank accounts, direct deposit, and other processes from leading global banks. Retail Payments Many consumer applications such as Uber and AirBnB offer popular retail payments to users. Chainlink can bring the same ease of use to smart contracts by giving them access to leading credit card providers and established payment networks, like PayPal and Stripe. Developers can start building applications that take advantage of the most in-demand payment outputs, both domestically and internationally, used on a daily basis in the retail economy. Chainlink already has pre-built modular external adapters for popular retail payment rails such as PayPal and Mistertango. Cryptocurrency Payments Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular, but some of the popular choices are often disconnected from the leading smart contract platforms. Chainlink bridges the gap by allowing any smart contract platform to make payments on any other distributed ledger, such as Bitcoin payments triggered from the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to provide exchange rates at the time of transfer or point of sale, ensuring users get fair market rates in a tamper-proof manner. Alchemy and Paycoin are examples of hybrid crypto/fiat payment platforms that will use Chainlink Price Feeds to determine exchange rates, allowing users to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies while the merchant still receives their preferred form of payment. Employee Salaries One significant source of inefficiency across nearly all industries in the legacy world is the delay in payments for services rendered to employees and contractors. Chainlink-powered smart contracts can be used to programmatically distribute payments to workers in real-time, which would reduce accounting overhead costs for employers, as well as providing access to earned wages for workers on a more immediate basis. Fiat on/off-ramp aggregator Transak laid out how this could work by using a work tracking API like WakaTime to trigger payments to developers on a regular basis. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to calculate the exact amount of crypto revenue to distribute, maintaining a certain USD value per payout. Remittances Remittances are quite common in an increasingly globalized world. However, despite advancements in technology, it’s a slow and expensive industry. Many DLT projects are aiming to disrupt the remittance industry and Chainlink oracles can provide reliable data on foreign exchange rates to smart contracts as well as enable direct deposit upon transfer. Onchain Finance Blockchain technology can replace backend processes across the financial system with modern digitized solutions. Through the automation of backend processes and syncing multiple ledgers of record, financial service providers can substantially reduce risk and enhance capital efficiency. Asset Tokenization Bringing real-world assets onchain—from currencies to stocks to bonds to real estate to gold—unlocks opportunities to increase investor access, enhance transparency, and strengthen market liquidity. Santander has reported that blockchain technology could help reduce banks’ infrastructure costs by $15-20B annually through the automation of backend office operations. Having high-quality, reliable data about the market price delivered onchain by Chainlink Price Feeds is essential for the creation of high-integrity markets for tokenized assets. For example, the PAXG Chainlink Price Feed—a tokenized gold token redeemable for one fine troy ounce of gold—enables secure markets to be built around physical gold. Additionally, Paxos uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to enable onchain verifications that their tokenized gold products are fully backed by gold reserves custodied offchain. To help bring capital markets onchain, Chainlink is working with The Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system processing $2+ quadrillion annually. DTCC is exploring how Chainlink CCIP can unlock tokenized asset interoperability. Additionally, as part of a previous collaboration with Swift and Chainlink, DTCC minted and issued “BondTokens” compatible with CCIP and distributed them onchain to Swift’s designated test wallets. Cross-Chain Transfers CCIP enables the secure transfer of arbitrary data, tokens, and instructions between public and private blockchains. As the financial system increasingly moves assets onchain, CCIP can help securely transfer tokenized assets cross-chain, increasing access to the financial system for developing countries, enabling the creation of innovative new financial instruments, and enhancing liquidity for global markets. Swift and Chainlink, along with 12+ world-leading financial institutions, including DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream, ANZ Bank, Citi, BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Lloyds Banking Group, and SDX, successfully demonstrated a secure and scalable way to transfer tokenized assets cross-chain using CCIP and financial institutions’ existing backend infrastructure. “The collaboration between Swift, Chainlink, and the financial community represents significant progress towards enabling interoperability between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain networks […] By leveraging existing Swift infrastructure and Chainlink CCIP, the collaboration demonstrated the ability to transfer tokenised value efficiently and securely across public and private blockchains, using standardised messaging formats and proven business processes.”—Swift Chainlink CCIP enables secure transfers between public and private chains. Corporate Actions Corporate action errors cost 70% of market participants more than $2M in 2020, of which 56% were due to data issues. Blockchains create a shared source of truth or “golden record” that aligns various stakeholders around an immutable source of hyper-reliable corporate action data. This helps mitigate costly errors and removes the need for downstream stakeholders in corporate processes, such as the custodian, to recheck the accuracy of key data from multiple sources. Having this golden record onchain along with high-quality data and computation delivered onchain by Chainlink enables various corporate actions to be automated with smart contracts, reducing operational costs and shortening processing times. For example, a tokenized bond could have predetermined coupon payments embedded within the digital asset at the point of issuance. Examples of corporate actions that can benefit from blockchain technology include: Dividend distribution—A shared source of truth makes it seamless for owners to be identified and the distribution sent to the correct person. Further efficiency gains could be achieved by distributing dividends via an onchain payments system. Distributing fund performance data—Publishing fund data onchain provides a reliable source of truth and makes it instantly available to all market participants, who can automatically pull that data into their own systems. Capturing proxy votes—Web3 systems make it easier to identify which investors have voting rights and enable them to cast or delegate their vote, reducing reconciliation costs and time, enhancing voting transparency, and removing operation risks around over- or under-voting. Ultimately, more seamless onchain voting systems could help raise voting participation among retail investors, which currently sits at just 28%. Cross-Chain Settlement Chainlink CCIP provides financial institutions with the ability to trade and settle tokenized assets across public and private blockchains, unlocking onchain DvP and atomic settlement for capital markets. For example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), the largest institutional bank in Australia with over $1 trillion in assets under management, worked with Chainlink to demonstrate cross-chain tokenized asset settlement transactions using CCIP and ANZ-issued stablecoins and tokenized assets. “The value and the message moving together is revolutionary. That’s a real breakthrough.”—Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead at ANZ, at Sibos 2023 ANZ’s Digital Asset Services Portal integrated with CCIP to showcase how clients could transact tokenized assets across any blockchain through an existing web app. NFTs, Gaming, and Randomness While DeFi is currently the largest smart contract market, developers are increasingly building fraudproof, crypto-economically incentivized gaming applications. One of the unique characteristics of blockchain games is their ability to generate rare tokenized in-game items (mostly as NFTs), as the blockchain provides definite proof of the item’s rarity. Minting these rare items in a manner that the external entities or the game’s developers can manipulate to their own advantage is key to ensuring their value, which is why Chainlink developed a Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF is a secure and provably fair source of Random Number Generation (RNG), which generates on-chain cryptographic proofs to prove to users that the randomness was not tampered with. Their provably fair form of randomness brings reliability to the rarity of items, opening up things like virtual metaverses, where tokenized items can be reliably used across different games. Verifiable randomness is also critical to creating unquestioned fairness to regulated gambling applications, removing the need to trust that the house is telling the truth about their odds. Additionally, Chainlink VRF can order participants for in-demand giveaways and events or fairly select participants for low-demand events like jury duty in an unbiased manner. Beyond randomness, gaming can benefit from numerous data sets, such as real-world event data to augment in-game functions/ratings, exchange rates to facilitate NFT markets, IoT data to connect the physical world on-chain, and much more. Random Rewards and NFTs In-game items are a critical component of most games, as they provide users with special powers or unique attributes. Many in-game items are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a token that is unique and not interchangeable. Chainlink VRF is already playing an important role in generating provably random NFTs and creating NFT attributes as rewards for different predefined in-game achievements, such as earning a rare skin for finishing in the top 10. Aavegotchi is an example of an on-chain gaming project on the Polygon sidechain that used Chainlink VRF to quickly and efficiently mint provably rare Aavegotchi NFTs with randomly selected attributes when players opened Portals. Another example is Ether Legends, a digital collectible trading card game that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFT prizes to top-tier players at the end of a season. Popular gaming dApp Axie Infinity also recently announced that it is using Chainlink VRF to generate provably random traits for Origin Axies within the game’s digital pet universe. Ether Legends uses Chainlink VRF to mint and randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFTs Dynamic NFTs Dynamic NFTs expand upon the concept of NFTs by enabling such tokens to evolve and change over time as determined by real-world events or verifiable randomness delivered by Chainlink oracles. Compared to static NFTs, which do not change after minting, dynamic NFTs can change in rarity and utility over time, providing a gamified experience to collecting NFTs. MLB star Trey Mancini and NBA Rookie of the Year LaMelo Ball are two examples of athletes who have minted Dynamic NFTs powered by Chainlink oracles on the Ethereum blockchain. With the former, the NFTs are represented as limited-edition digital baseball cards that use Chainlink VRF to assign special utility to NFTs in a verifiably fair and unbiased manner, with all NFT sale proceeds going to cancer research. For the latter, the NFTs upgrade over time according to the player’s performance in the real world, where the EVOLVE tokens were activated when LaMelo Ball was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year. Trey Mancini’s NFTs use Chainlink VRF to randomly assign additional utility. Random Gameplay Unpredictability is one of the hallmarks of fun games. The excitement of not knowing the next stage or what will happen around the corner creates suspense, intrigue, and challenge. Developers can leverage Chainlink VRF to ensure the integrity of unpredictable events. Some of these gameplay scenarios may include map generation, critical hits (battling games), matchmaking (multiplayer games), card draw order, and random encounters/events. Chainlink VRF enables smart contracts to use randomness for both inputs and outputs Prediction Markets Blockchain prediction markets enable individuals to bet on the outcome of specific real-world events. Due to their very nature, blockchain-based prediction markets, are reliant on external data to settle outcomes. Chainlink Data Feeds provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant source of external data that can be used to trigger the settlement of prediction markets as well as payment to the winners. Prediction markets have been created around sporting events results, political election outcomes, and cryptocurrency roadmap completions and price predictions, but ultimately prediction markets can encompass any type of wager as long as there are takers on the other side. Along with Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Automation is increasingly playing a key role in enhancing the security and decentralization of prediction markets. Instead of relying on DevOps teams, centralized automation bots like cron jobs, or incentive bounties to start and stop each prediction round and select the winner, Chainlink Automation can automate smart contract functions by triggering smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. Learn more in the Chainlink Automation developer documentation. Not only does Chainlink Automation save developers hundreds of hours, it also significantly enhances the security of prediction markets. By integrating Chainlink Automation into their prediction games to help start and stop prediction rounds and distribute rewards to winners, Entropyfi eliminated a single point of failure and was able to save 20 engineering hours per week. Everipedia, a blockchain-based encyclopedia, recently used Chainlink to relay election results on-chain to help settle prediction markets. Everipedia operates a Chainlink oracle node and delivered cryptographically signed data from The Associated Press regarding the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election onto the Ethereum blockchain, where Chainlink Data Feeds were then used by on-chain prediction markets such as YieldWars. Everipedia’s Chainlink node recently delivered the results of the 2020 US Presidential Election on-chain using data cryptographically signed by The Associated Press GameFi GameFi is a subsection of blockchain-based gaming. GameFi games enable players to earn in-game rewards. As its name suggests, GameFi lies at the intersection of blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance. By offering economic incentives, developers can create an engaging gaming experience that encourages players to participate in the game’s ecosystem. On GameFi platforms, players can earn rewards by progressing through the game, battling other players, and completing special tasks. Rewards include in-game tokens and NFTs representing weapons, skins, avatars, and virtual land, which can then be traded or sold on secondary markets, such as decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces. Non-custodial ownership gives players full control over their in-game assets, potentially enabling users to take their NFTs to other games and metaverses in the future. Automation is essential for developing advanced GameFi experiences. Developers need to automate smart contract functions to start and end game rounds on time, distribute rewards to players based on particular game outcomes, and much more. While developers could automate these processes using scripts on a centralized server, this would consume valuable time and create a single point of failure that could lead to exploits and reliability issues. In contrast, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can trigger smart contract functions in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. For example, the gamified NFT platform Nifty Royale is using Chainlink Automation to help trigger its NFT-based battle royale games. Specifically, Nifty Royale is using Automation to trigger the smart contract functions that start and end each round of its battle royale. By using Automation, Nifty Royale is increasing the security and reliability guarantees of its game, which is especially important as players can win in-game assets that have real-world value. If you want to take advantage of Chainlink Automation in your own GameFi project, explore the docs now. No-Loss Savings Games Advancements in DeFi composability have led to innovative applications such as no-loss savings games—dApps which pool user deposits and lend them out on a decentralized money market in order to accrue interest. After a specified time frame, a winner is selected, earning all the accumulated interest from the pool. After the winner is chosen, all users are able to withdraw their original deposit without any loss. An example of this is PoolTogether, an on-chain no-loss savings game that uses Chainlink VRF to select the winner of each prize. By utilizing a transparent and verifiable source of on-chain randomness, users are provided a higher degree of trust in the overall reliability and fairness of the no-loss prize pool platform. PoolTogether uses Chainlink VRF to randomly choose winners in their no-loss savings game Sports and Esports Smart contracts provide integrity to the execution of an online sports bet, while Chainlink decentralized oracle networks can verify sporting outcomes by aggregating data from reliable web APIs. These smart contracts (usually in the form of prediction markets) can be based on a match’s result, individual performances, or even something as seemingly inconsequential as a game’s opening coin toss. On top of that, it’s possible for eSports prediction markets to retrieve gaming data and broadcast it on-chain to determine the winners. One example of a blockchain-based sports betting market is Augur, which uses Chainlink oracles on the high-throughput Polygon sidechain to power its Turbo prediction markets. Users can speculate on the outcome of a wide range of topics including different sports events in the NBA, MLB, MMA, and Olympics that are rapidly settled after a market closes using decentralized oracle networks that provide premium real-world data. Augur uses Chainlink Data Feeds to power their Turbo prediction markets. Insurance The insurance industry today operates in a low-trust business environment. Policyholders have an incentive to falsely report positive metrics in insurance applications to reduce their monthly deductibles and insurers have an incentive to delay payments and raise rates to account for misrepresented risk profiles. Since insurance companies are responsible for processing claims and are much more capitalized than policyholders, they wield substantially more power in terms of when and how claims are settled. Chainlink-powered smart contracts shift insurance contracts towards a more objective, equal-standing model where data directly determines the outcomes and execution is deterministic, without tampering by either party. Parametric Insurance Traditional insurance firms can leverage the benefits of blockchain technology by creating advanced smart contract-based parametric insurance agreements that automatically trigger payouts based on real-world data as delivered by decentralized oracle networks. By reducing reliance on manual arbitration and mitigating delayed payments as a result, coverage can be provided to a broader range of businesses to hedge a wide range of risks that exist in the real world. Crop Insurance Crop insurance has long been considered an especially promising use case for smart contracts as it provides farmers in developing nations with insurance which they otherwise could not get access to or don’t trust due to underdeveloped local insurance markets. By providing anyone with an Internet connection the ability to hedge against unforeseen weather conditions, farmers all over the world are able to maintain their livelihood without the concern that one bad weather season could cause financial ruin. One example of this is Arbol, a smart contract-based weather coverage solution that uses Chainlink oracles to fetch rainfall datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data is used to settle parametric crop insurance contracts that provide coverage based on the amount of rainfall in the region. Arbol uses Chainlink oracles to fetch weather data used to execute parametric crop insurance contracts Flight Insurance One of the earliest forms of smart contract insurance to reach production is flight insurance. Due to a range of uncontrollable variables such as weather and maintenance, flights are often delayed, leading to inconveniences for business travelers. Flight insurance policies allow travelers to mitigate these opportunity costs, as they pay out compensation in the event of a delay. One example is Etherisc, a decentralized insurance protocol that leverages Chainlink oracles to retrieve flight data in order to confirm whether or not it’s been delayed. By removing the need for dispute periods, insurees are guaranteed that they will immediately receive a payment if their flight was delayed and insurers are able to reduce costs by removing manual claims processing. Car Insurance Modern vehicles come with a wide range of internal sensors, internet connectivity, and even native APIs. The winner of Chainlink’s 2020 Virtual Hackathon, Link My Ride, made use of some of these data points, allowing the smart contract to specify a rental period, unlock the vehicle doors for the renter, record the length of time rented, calculate mileage driven, determine the remaining battery charge, and automate rental payments. These functionalities came together to create a complex car rental contract for a Tesla vehicle using a custom external adapter. As vehicle-based APIs grow more sophisticated, new forms of insurance will become available including parametric car insurance that triggers based on numerous impact sensors in the vehicle or insurance discounts based on metrics like mileage driven per year. Home Insurance The growing “smart home” phenomenon is leading to sensors and advanced security systems that automatically inform homeowners and emergency services of unusual events. These sensors can be connected to smart contracts through Chainlink oracles in order to create new parametric home insurance products. Especially useful for vacation homes and other residences that are not used year-round, insurance products can be wired to detect broken pipes, malfunctioning solar panels, or even home intrusions as a means of a more direct skin-in-the-game alarm system protection from companies. Life Insurance Smart contracts with sound data are ideal for reducing the costs and occurrence of disputes, as well as speeding up the time of settlement. Numerous web APIs and external databases host sufficient data for determining if and when a death occurred, such as death certificates, obituaries, cremation records, and police reports. Chainlink can use that data to autonomously issue out payments and distribute assets amongst several parties listed in a life insurance policy, eliminating unnecessary overhead and accelerating payments to policyholders. Health Insurance Due to countless advancements in biotech and IoT wearables (e.g. Smartwatches), insurance companies can create smart contracts that offer health insurance discounts or trigger penalties based on a patient’s health data. Useful data points can include distance traveled (exercise), body weight, heart rate, and possibly more advanced biometrics as they are made available into the future. Chainlink oracles can also spot data anomalies that can trigger mandatory consultations in order to keep favorable policy rates. Gran Fondo, an ETHDenver 2019 Hackathon entry, used Chainlink oracles to bring GPS time-stamped data from IoT wearable devices on-chain to enable the creation of on-chain athletic competitions that payout in ETH. This same exact data can also be used to create health insurance contracts that determine premium rates based on the amount of physical activity within a certain time frame as recorded by the Chainlink-connected IoT wearable device. Marine Insurance Climate-related uncertainty is leading to increasingly unpredictable seaway conditions such as low or high water levels. This can result in hundreds of millions of dollars lost due to the temporary closing of major shipping seaway channels. Smart contracts can use Chainlink oracles to connect to an array of real-world sensors to issue parametric insurance coverage for a wide range of coverage protections, such as the thawing of frozen goods during transit, damages to shipping vessels, or late shipments due to unforeseen weather conditions. One example of this is a hackathon project aimed to insure cargo carriers in the event of the climate change-related closure of major shipping routes. Chainlink oracles connected to water level sensors that trigger insurance payouts in the event of water dropping or rising above present levels determined to lead to waterway closures. Reinsurance Insurance is a difficult industry for potential entrepreneurs to enter because of the risks associated with underwriting large numbers of policies. In a catastrophic event, an insurance company may be unable to cover all obligations, leading to default. As such, many companies “reinsure” their underwritten portfolio—offloading a portion of their risk in case they cannot cover all claims. One possible solution would be to tokenize reinsurance policies as smart contracts. This would allow individual investors to back insurance policies by buying fractions of a policy. Chainlink oracles can be used within this process to denominate the current value of an insurance policy, route insurance payments to token holders, and autonomously trigger insurance payouts. Enterprise Systems Smart contracts provide ample opportunities for enterprises to cut costs and improve efficiency in multi-party business processes thanks to reductions in counterparty risk, intermediary overhead, and external disputes. However, in order to leverage smart contracts, enterprises require additional considerations around privacy, scalability, and connectivity in order to meet certain business and legal requirements. Chainlink provides a gateway for enterprises to both sell their data and API services to blockchain environments and satisfy certain technical requirements like on-chain access to private data, off-chain computation of contract logic, on-chain privacy of transactions, and much more. Blockchain Abstraction Layer Just as the Internet acts as a single gateway for connecting computers, Chainlink provides enterprises with a single middleware for connecting their APIs to every blockchain environment. Chainlink is blockchain agnostic and can be integrated onto any current and future blockchain, with many leading chains already supporting Chainlink, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more. By having Chainlink operate across all the major chains, enterprises can leverage it as a “blockchain abstraction layer” used to get their existing systems “blockchain-enabled” across any/all chains efficiently. This reduces integration work to a minimum so enterprises don’t have to rebuild existing infrastructure, but instead can focus on their core blockchain strategy. Vendor lock-in is limited by removing the burden of enterprises to choose which blockchain is the most likely to become the industry standard. Additionally, Chainlink nodes provide key advantages such as secure private key management, secure off-chain computation, trust-minimized hardware, permission controls, and more. Enterprises can use Chainlink oracles as a blockchain abstraction layer to connect their backend systems to smart contracts across any DLT networks Monetization of Data and APIs Chainlink’s built-in flexibility ensures it’s fully compatible with existing legacy data and API infrastructure. Thus, data providers can also use Chainlink’s blockchain abstraction layer to sell their data to smart contracts on any blockchain. This can be done in two ways: selling data to the Chainlink Network or the data provider running their own Chainlink oracle node to sell data directly to blockchains. By selling data to the Chainlink Network, data providers don’t need to change anything about their current business model, meaning back-end modifications aren’t necessary and they can accept payments in fiat currency. Alternatively, data providers who see the value in the smart contract economy can run a Chainlink Node to provide signed data (using digital signatures) directly to smart contracts, allowing them to earn more revenue and build a reputation as a reliable data provider. Data providers can sell their data to the Chainlink Network using their existing API interfaces without modifications and/or can operate a Chainlink node to provide smart contracts with origin-signed data Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) Operating a Chainlink node enables data providers to begin selling their API connections to smart contracts applications. To simplify the experience of launching a Chainlink oracle node, infrastructure providers can offer Node-as-Service (NaaS) solutions in order to quickly spin up new Chainlink nodes and connect a data provider’s existing APIs to blockchain networks in a backward-compatible manner. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a leading cloud provider that has collaborated with Chainlink Labs to launch the AWS Chainlink Quickstart—a one-click workflow for data providers and DevOps teams to easily launch a Chainlink oracle node on AWS Cloud and sell real-world data to smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks. The future-proof framework enables data providers to seamlessly launch a Chainlink node on AWS, allowing them to cryptographically sign their data and broadcast it onto blockchains where it can be sold to smart contract applications. The AWS Chainlink Quickstart gives data providers a single gateway to all blockchains Hybrid Cloud/Blockchain Applications As smart contracts evolve, there becomes an increasing demand for more advanced decentralized applications that require expensive or complex computations which are not feasible on-chain. One solution is using oracles to attest to off-chain computations processed within more scalable cloud computing environments. Leveraging Chainlink’s bidirectional communication capabilities, hybrid cloud/blockchain applications can be created that route computational instructions and/or data off-chain for processing, as well as bridge the results back on-chain for smart contract use. One example is NOAA weather hosted on Google Cloud which is being brought onto the Etheruem blockchain using Chainlink oracles. Through this integration, smart contracts can access high-quality weather data (temperature, precipitation, hail, etc) to power parametric crop insurance agreements such as those offered by Arbol. NOAA weather data hosted on Google Cloud being brought on-chain using Chainlink oracles Privacy-Preserving Data Queries and Credential Management For many enterprises and institutions, data privacy is not an optional bonus but instead a strict requirement necessary to meet regulatory mandates such as GDPR. Chainlink is developing a cutting-edge solution to this challenge through the recent acquisition of DECO—a privacy-preserving oracle technology created by an Ari Juels-led team at Cornell University. DECO allows all data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS, which is most of the world’s data, to be confidentially attested to by oracles without the data ever being revealed on-chain (it never leaves the off-chain database) and without any modifications to the servers hosting the off-chain data. For example, Alice is able to use DECO to prove her bank account balance is above a certain threshold without revealing her exact account balance or her identity on-chain or to the oracle itself. This opens up nearly all of the world’s data to be leveraged on-chain while still retaining confidentiality and data licensing agreements. Chainlink’s DECO uses zero knowledge proofs to enable the use of confidential data within smart contracts without revealing the data on-chain or to the oracles On-Chain Transaction Privacy In addition to privacy of data inputs, many enterprises want privacy of contract logic and outputs. Chainlink has developed a way of using oracles to provide on-chain transaction privacy for DeFi smart contracts via a solution called Mixicles. Mixicles separate the on-chain data inputs from on-chain payment outputs, using an oracle as the bridge between the two components and a transaction mixer. Instead of delivering the raw data input on-chain, Chainlink oracles post an integer representation that only has meaning to the contract participants (e.g. a 1 or 2 as seen in the example below). A mixer can then take that integer input to execute a payout to a party that is concealed, yet still produces an on-chain audit report for users as a means of meeting regulatory requirements. The Mixicles protocol is able to achieve multiple layers of privacy, such as concealing the terms of the contract, the data source used, the true value of funds within the contract, and who received the payment (in terms of correlation to the input). Private Off-Chain Computation Chainlink practices a defense-in-depth approach to security, where users leverage multiple layers of security to get a variety of guarantees. Another solution being developed by Chainlink is Town Crier, an oracle protocol that uses additional hardware in the form of a trusted execution environment (TEE) to achieve private, generalized off-chain computation. Town Crier uses TEE-based oracles (specifically Intel SGX) to enable Chainlink oracle nodes to perform advanced computations on data within a black box environment where data cannot be leaked, even to the node operator. Town Crier provides both data confidentiality and computation integrity, opening up new oracle use cases like handling private keys for cryptocurrency payments or user login credentials for identity verifications. Chainlink’s Town Crier uses Intel SGX to enable off-chain data confidentiality and computational integrity Solidity Computation As smart contracts continue to accelerate in adoption, there is an increasing demand for practical scaling solutions that can boost the throughput and lower the latency of decentralized applications, while retaining base-layer security of user funds. Commonly these layer-2 scalability solutions require the existence of one or more off-chain validator nodes that are responsible for batching transactions and delivering a succinct response onto the base-layer chain as needed. Chainlink oracle nodes are compute-enabled and can serve as validators for layer-2 solutions, such as for Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum Rollups. Chainlink nodes can perform Arbitrum computation of Solidity functions, generate fraud proofs, and stake LINK collateral to back their services without any modifications. The end result is using oracles not just for data inputs, but for performing scalable off-chain Solidity computation too. Layer 2 Arbitrum Rollup chains can be operated and validated by Chainlink oracles, creating highly scalable smart contract applications secured by fraud proofs and cryptoeconomics. Infrastructure Provider Oracle Nodes Blockchains require a decentralized network of infrastructure providers such as validators, sequencers, transcoders, and oracles. Traditional infrastructure providers, such as telecommunications firms or internet service providers, can support the Chainlink Network and earn additional revenue by directly operating a Chainlink oracle node. By leveraging their existing in-house infrastructure, such providers can provide highly reliable oracle services and monetize the growth of the hybrid smart contract ecosystem. Deutsche Telekom MMS, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (Europe’s largest telecommunications provider) operates a Chainlink oracle node and provides financial market data to numerous leading DeFi applications. As the demand for universally connected smart contracts continues to grow, the revenue opportunities can increase, leading to additional infrastructure providers launching Chainlink nodes. “By operating a Chainlink node, Deutsche Telekom MMS will provide reliable real-world data to Chainlink network users and decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, further supporting the vision of public blockchains as a foundation for numerous use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).” –Deutsche Telekom MMS Deutsche Telekom subsidiary Deutsche Telekom MMS operates Chainlink oracle infrastructure and provides smart contracts with real-world data and events Abstract Cryptocurrency Payments Through Invoicing Given the novelty, volatility, and regulatory uncertainties around cryptocurrencies/tokens, some enterprises are currently hesitant to personally hold and handle cryptocurrencies. With most blockchain infrastructure requiring cryptocurrency to operate, enterprise adoption still remains limited or even completely blocked off. Instead of waiting on the often slow legal system to resolve the issue or for enterprises to warm up to the idea, Chainlink oracles can be used as a workaround to the problem using common invoicing techniques widely used today to allow them to pay third service providers in fiat, which then handle cryptocurrency payments in the background. Hackathon project LINK Gas Station takes the concept of Meta-Transactions—where blockchain transaction fees are abstracted away and paid by a relayer—and applies it to Chainlink. It uses third-party relayers to manage ownership of the utility tokens LINK and ETH, both of which are needed to pay for Ethereum computation and obtain Chainlink oracle data services. By doing so, the liability and complexity of cryptocurrency ownership shifts away from the enterprise and onto the chosen relayer, resulting in a process where an enterprise can simply pay an invoice in fiat and gain access to the entire decentralized ecosystem. Importantly, enterprises still have full control over the cryptographic private key required to sign-off on transactions. External Data for Baseline Protocol Baseline Protocol is a framework for syncing enterprise systems of record using the Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference. Baseline uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure disparate enterprise databases are kept in a state of consistency (same set of records) with their counterparties without revealing any confidential data on-chain. Chainlink oracles are a key piece of infrastructure for ensuring Baseline events are using the same external data inputs. For example, dynamic purchase orders can leverage Chainlink oracles to fetch aggregated weather data (from multiple sources) regarding the temperature of the goods being shipped. The price per item in the purchase order can be autonomously updated depending on the temperature, such as bananas with dynamic pricing based on weather conditions. Chainlink’s ability to create consistency around external data inputs creates consistency among business partners, reducing disagreements and reconciliation. Multi-party agreements using the Baseline Protocol can use Chainlink oracles to fetch redundantly validated real-world data and events Bootstrap Legacy System Security As outlined in the whitepaper, Chainlink will use service level agreements (SLAs) and staking to create additional security and crypto-economic guarantees for oracle services. The SLA, which exists on-chain and is signed by both parties, defines the terms of the oracle service and the penalties/rewards issued based on the oracle’s performance. The results of the SLAs can be fed into reputation systems where future users can assess the reliability of a node. Enterprises running their own Chainlink Node can use staking-backed SLAs to bootstrap the reliability and security of their data and off-chain services, forcing them to have real economic stakes and reputation on the line for failing to meet their stated requirements. This allows enterprises and data providers to provide deterministic guarantees to automated processes like smart contracts without rebuilding their entire backend systems. Supply Chain A supply chain starts from the sourcing of materials and ends with delivering goods to the end customer. Along the route there are payments transferred, changes in ownership, customs clearances, regulatory oversights, and documents shared between parties. Smart contracts offer a way to automate these processes as a means of reducing friction and counterparty risks in global trade. Chainlink oracles can connect supply chain smart contracts to web APIs, cloud networks, and various real-world sensors, such as GPS, temperature, velocity, acceleration, humidity, luminosity, and more. This data can be used to trigger payments and transfers of data between parties in a manner that can’t be manipulated by any single party in the supply chain. Such a framework generates a golden source of truth for all involved parties with substantially less overhead. RFID Tracking Supply chains are increasingly making use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to track goods. RFID systems connect inventory items with tags that can be detected at distance via a radio frequency. This allows for simplified and highly efficient tracking of store merchandise, shipping pallets, and many other common inventory methods. With Chainlink oracles, RFID data from the real world can be used to trigger a wide range of on-chain contracts, including the initiation of payment upon receipt of inventory at a warehouse, or autonomous insurance payouts for delayed shipments. The Open Library Project, a project created during the Chainlink Virtual Hackathon 2020, used Chainlink oracles to build an RFID blockchain integration that enables users to check RFID-tagged books in and out and record this activity on-chain, creating a decentralized and borderless book rental platform. RFID devices can be connected to smart contracts using Chainlink oracles. IoT Sensors IoT sensors can be used to ensure that products in transit are properly maintained throughout the supply chain journey. Examples include keeping food at certain temperatures and sealing containers against tampering. Chainlink can be used to create blockchain IoT integrations by connecting IoT sensors to smart contracts that trigger onchain events, such as payouts and issuing fines depending on whether or not the IoT data confirms quality control standards were adhered to as defined in the predefined purchase order. Chainlink and Vodafone’s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) have successfully demonstrated the seamless exchange of trade documents across diverse platforms and blockchains using CCIP. This collaboration has the potential to enable applications in a supply chain to securely exchange data and tokens across public and private blockchains, and access data from IoT devices via the DAB platform. “Vodafone DAB and Chainlink are showing how their platforms can be combined to cut through this sea of incompatibility by bridging traditional markets with advanced decentralised platforms. This ensures seamless and secure exchanges of data and services across the global trade ecosystem, estimated to be worth over $30 trillion last year.”—Jorge Bento, CEO of Vodafone DAB Another example of this is PingNET, a decentralized transmission network for IoT devices that uses Chainlink to help enable automated payments between stakeholders based on data from IoT-enabled pallets on PingNET. PingNet also aims to bring other IoT event data onchain, like Humidity, Altitude, UV index, Radiation, and more. Customs Clearance When cargo is shipped across borders to countries with varying regulations, most often it requires clearance from the receiving nation’s customs agency to prevent the shipment of illegal or dangerous goods. Many trade finance contracts will require access to this data to determine the status of a shipment in real-time. As smart contracts begin to automate such agreements, they will still require information regarding customs clearance. Chainlink oracles can directly provide this data in a privacy-preserving manner, allowing for end-to-end automation of a cross-border trade finance contract. Bill of Lading, Invoice, and Policy of Insurance International trade paperwork largely consists of three main documents: a Bill of Lading, issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment; an Invoice, issued by a seller to a buyer regarding the details of a sales transaction; and a Policy of Insurance—a contract between the insurer and the policyholder stating the claims the insurer is legally required to pay. Each of these documents can benefit from oracles; it would be possible to use oracles to generate a Bill of Lading directly from data, provide foreign exchange rates to Payment Invoices, and provide IoT quality control data to an on-chain Policy of Insurance contract to trigger settlement. Utilities Utilities like water, energy, and the Internet are foundational pillars of modern society. The efficient functioning and management of these utilities is vital to social and physical health, yet they often rely on poorly incentivized business dynamics and outdated infrastructure. Smart contracts bring modernization to utilities infrastructure by moving them towards fairer, automated, real-time systems that use decentralized networks, data, and crypto-economic incentives to enforce such conditions. This ensures that utility providers are held to a higher standard and users have better access to objective data showcasing the quality and status of key utility services. Chainlink oracles can connect blockchain networks to utilities Internet, Telecommunications, and Cloud Hosting Many utilities like the Internet, cable TV, and cloud hosting charge customers based on set pricing structures. However, when their services go down, sometimes causing large financial losses due to opportunity costs (e.g. exchanges experiencing downtime due to a cloud outage), no one is held accountable. IoT sensors can monitor the uptime of utilities and Chainlink can feed their performance data into a smart contract to calculate monthly payments or issue reimbursements based on downtime. ETHNewYork 2019 hackathon entry Blocksolid explored a use case where NGOs could hold Internet Service Providers (ISPs) accountable for faulty internet services in developing regions. They did so by tracking Internet Service Provider (ISP) uptime and using Chainlink oracles to relay this data on-chain. If downtime is detected, the on-chain smart contract holding donated funds is updated to prevent withdrawals from the ISP. Energy Energy providers are responsible for ensuring all the world’s infrastructure receives the energy required to power the global economy. To increase the efficiency of energy delivery, Chainlink oracles can be used to feed consumption rates into a smart contract to trigger over-consumption penalties, levy CO2 taxes, and provide current energy prices to fairly generate electricity bills and allow payments in different currencies. Smart contracts can take readings from smart meters to monetize someone’s output, track consumption, and facilitate payouts between the two. Dipole, a blockchain-based distributed energy trading market, plans to use Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the on-chain trading and valuation of energy assets. Users can then purchase energy resources using fiat or cryptocurrency with exchange rates determined by Chainlink-powered decentralized price feeds. Water While often taken for granted, the infrastructure that ensures your tap at home can provide you with water is heavily monitored for quality control and reliability. IoT sensors can monitor water tables, track corporate consumption, and identify illegal siphoning of public bodies. Chainlink can feed data from this IoT data to smart contracts in order to issue regulatory fines, generate consumption invoices, trigger autopayments, update supply tracking databases, or even trigger emergency funding to cities at risk of floods. Emissions and Waste Management The emissions and waste disposal industries can be transformed by IoT-enabled smart contracts that can accurately measure output and efficiency. Through Chainlink oracles, this data can be used to automatically trigger payments to the proper regulating body for overconsumption, monetize the garbage used in recycling or waste-to-fuel technologies, or generate incentivized payment structures that lower garbage bills when someone consumes less or uses more biodegradable items. Authorization and Identity While smart contract-enabled blockchain networks are inherently pseudonymous, there is strong demand for users to be able to prove their real-life identity as means of ensuring Sybil-resistance and/or granting clearance. Through Chainlink oracles, traditional data infrastructure containing user identities (such as governmental databases, social media, etc.) can be connected to smart contract applications, either by tying a user’s identity to their on-chain address or attesting to data in an off-chain server. This ensures institutions are able to maintain full regulatory compliance and provide an additional layer of security via dealing with known identities. E-signatures E-signatures have become an increasingly popular way to obtain signatures on documents. They have modernized the signature process and helped companies avoid the costly overhead of obtaining a hand-written physical signature. With signatures being the most common way to authorize contracts, it’s a necessity that Chainlink oracles give smart contracts access to leading e-signature companies like DocuSign. Chainlink can benefit the e-signature industry in two ways: attesting to the e-signature and relaying it on-chain, or providing existing e-signature solutions with access to external data as a means of making their contract solutions more dynamic. FirmaChain, a blockchain-based digital signature and contracting solution, is using Chainlink oracles to allow its digital contracts to execute according to real-world data and events, like checking the authenticity of a driver’s license before approving a car rental. Another example is EthSign, an automated contract settlement framework where users can define off-chain data sources through Chainlink oracles as well as their respective trigger conditions. Biometrics Another verifiable way to authorize a smart contract is through biometric data, such as a fingerprint or a retinal eye scan. Since biometrics are uniquely identifiable to a specific person, they can be an effective way to verify someone’s identity as long as there is a reliable database or source to cross-reference it against. Chainlink oracles can both deliver the biometric data to the smart contract and connect it to different off-chain databases to verify authenticity. Chainlink oracles can connect smart contracts to biometric data. Credentials Using trusted hardware and/or advanced cryptography, Chainlink oracles securely handle the private account information of external systems and applications. This enables smart contracts to directly verify credentials, such as whether someone has the proper amount of funds or possesses a specific security key. Once Chainlink oracles relay the confirmation on-chain, the smart contract can trigger execution and settlement of funds. Bringing credentials on-chain can also be especially effective for verifying inputs before exchanging valuable assets. KYC/AML Institutions leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology often require additional infrastructure to ensure full regulatory compliance in regards to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. This requires the use of an external oracle to provide the data regarding the identity and full history of funds being transferred. Coinfirm is one example of a blockchain analytics firm that is using Chainlink oracles to bring data from its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution on-chain. This provides a plug-and-play solution for users wanting to add compliance to any on-chain application through real-time verification by an oracle network. Additionally, CipherTrace launched DeFi compliance oracle service on Chainlink to enable DEXs and other DeFi applications to abide by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions requirements by providing source-signed compliance data on-chain. CipherTrace launched a Chainlink oracle node to bring AML data on-chain. Social Media Identity and Domain Names Blockchains still have a steep learning curve for many people, particularly around dealing with long hexadecimal addresses. In order to improve user experience, oracles are being used to help transform hexadecimal addresses into human-readable names like “chad.crypto”. One example is Unstoppable Domains, an on-chain domain name repository using Chainlink oracles to tie a user’s Twitter social media account to their human-readable on-chain address in a verifiable and transparent manner. This allows anyone to verify that a blockchain domain is tied to a user’s social media account before sending them funds. Unstoppable Domains uses Chainlink oracles to enable users to tie their off-chain Twitter identity to their on-chain Ethereum domain name Smart Contract Audit Results To ensure the integrity and proper functioning of smart contract applications, developers may want to verify whether or not a protocol has undergone one or multiple security audits before sending it funds. Using an oracle, users can get on-demand verification of audit results directly on-chain, opening up use cases like automatic checks before certain transactions, such as high-value ones, or when acting as a trusted custodian for other users funds. Cybersecurity firm Hacken will use Chainlink oracles to bring their security data on-chain regarding smart contract audits, penetration tests on centralized exchanges, bug bounties, and more. This data can then be utilized by smart contracts to prevent interactions with dangerous and/or unaudited smart contracts. Hacken uses Chainlink oracles to bring security audit reports on-chain to be used by smart contract applications Account Security Two-factor authentication (2FA) is another method a user can leverage to secure their online accounts, requiring an additional layer of verification beyond a username and password. This increase of security prevents unauthorized access to confidential information, as well as preventing the transferring of funds without multiple verifications. With Chainlink oracles, smart contracts are able to be enhanced with 2FA functionalities, directly protecting a user’s cryptocurrency holdings. Digital Bridge is an example of a project using Chainlink oracles to bring 2FA security to smart contracts on the Matic Network. By connecting to a high-availability 2FA API authentication service, Chainlink enables users to create a defense-in-depth strategy for their on-chain funds, preventing unauthorized transfers even in the event that their private key is stolen. Digital Bridge uses Chainlink oracles to enable smart contracts secured by 2 Factor Authentication services Intellectual Property All types of intellectual property, from royalties like copyrights and trademarks to license fees for patents, can be turned into smart contracts. Chainlink can be used to check IP databases for ownership verification, verify off-chain credentials before IP access, and facilitate payments from the user to the IP owner. Smart contracts could even tokenize partial ownership of IP and divvy out payments according to a person’s share percentage. Large enterprises such as Microsoft and EY have shown this to be a practical solution that significantly reduces operational inefficiencies in the rights and royalties management process. Contribution Bounties Open-source technology is growing in popularity, and can benefit from more expansive bounty programs to incentivize contributions. However, verification of a contributor’s work and payments to them are often manual processes, raising costs and delaying payout timelines. Chainlink oracles can be used to track contributions on public code repositories such as GitHub and unlock a payment escrow once predefined test cases for a bounty have passed without errors. Government While society may not agree on various issues, an initiative most people can get behind is creating more transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government institutions. Blockchains provide society with new infrastructure for tracking and executing government processes, smart contracts offer tamperproof guardrails on how governments are allowed to take action, and oracles allow for the use of objective data to trigger the execution of those actions as opposed to always leaving it up to centralized interpretation. Oracles are one of the most important ingredients to realizing the value of smart contracts within government processes, as they both provide a bridge to connect legacy infrastructure to blockchains and serve as the final triggers for executing the contract. Regulation Enterprise use of smart contracts will require new forms of automated regulatory compliance. While some restrictions can be hardcoded into the smart contract’s programmatic code, governments can also make use of oracles as a way of extracting metadata from the smart contract or requiring external approval from a government-run oracle before broadcasting a transaction. An example of a Compliance Oracle was outlined in the Project Whitney Case Study initiated by the Depository and Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the post-trade financial services company that settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States. As stated in the case study, a compliance oracle is a “Dynamic rules engine that enables issuers and investors to maintain compliance throughout a securities lifecycle by approving/rejecting transactions. When a transaction is approved, the stock record is updated, and the movement of tokens on-chain occurs.” Voting Given the recent polarization around election results, there is increasing demand for secure, tamper-proof voting solutions that establish integrity in the election process. While it may take time to overhaul government voting systems, one can envision a simplified scenario where a vote can be cast on-chain using a private key, an oracle can verify the ID of the person from multiple approved sources in a privacy-preserving manner via DECO, and, if they match, then a confirmation is published on-chain where it is stored as an immutable record that can be cryptographically verified by anyone. This leads to the creation of a more sustainable democracy through tamper-proof voting, aligning with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Deeds/Permits/Certificates Smart contracts can be used to bring more efficiency and integrity to the issuance of government certificates, permits, and deeds. Oracles can be used to generate certificates more autonomously, such as through using DECO to verify a person’s credentials before sending them a tokenized document such as a permit. Using a system like DECO allows the smart contract to query a set of authoritative sources in a privacy-preserving manner. Such an automated process could save billions of dollars in government spending. Sustainability Regenerative Agriculture Hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain code and real-world data from IoT sensors and satellite data can be leveraged to create fully traceable, transparent, and automated incentivization systems that directly reward individuals, companies, and governments for taking part in sustainable practices and fighting against both climate change and mitigating its harmful effects. This can include the creation of tokenized carbon offsets, regenerative agriculture, and even the monitoring of consumption to reward those who stay within their means. The Green World Campaign is an example of one project that aims to use hybrid smart contracts to incentivize regenerative agriculture in a reforestation program created in collaboration with IC3 and funded by a Chainlink Community Grant. This program uses satellite remote sensing data that is fed on-chain by Chainlink oracles to reward stewards of regenerative agriculture who help reforest degraded land. By incentivizing carbon drawdown, their plan is to eventually plant billions of trees and help raise the living and health standards of those in developing regions. How AIRS incentivizes regenerative agriculture using satellite data, Chainlink oracles, and hybrid smart contracts. Satellite Imagery and Drones While slightly more advanced, it’s not hard to imagine a future where satellite imagery is used in combination with IoT networks and drones to gather data on external activities like a construction project. Through artificial intelligence, the data could then be analyzed and cross-referenced with past projects to determine the completion percentage of a project. Chainlink oracles could relay that data to an on-chain smart contract to issue completion-based payouts to construction companies, solving a major problem in delayed cash flows for companies performing large, time-consuming projects. During a fireside chat between Chainlink Labs Chief Scientist Ari Juels and Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Ari discussed his early work with PhD student Sishan Long on a project called AIRS: Automated Incentives for Reforestation Stewardship. AIRS aims to incentivize stewardship of the environment by consistently taking in satellite data (carbon capture capacity, the ability to sequester carbon, carbon sync capability, etc.) and monitoring its state over time using trusted execution environments. The idea is for entities like governments and NGOs to pour money into the smart contract, which then gets dispensed to the people who are responsible for maintaining and expanding this very important carbon sink, incentivizing sustainable practices. Off-Chain Computation Verifiable Randomness (VRF) On-chain applications do not have access to a secure Random Number Generator (RNG) due to the deterministic nature of blockchain networks. Using the on-chain blockhash can result in manipulation from blockchain miners/validators who discard blocks with unfavorable hashes and can “re-roll the dice”, ultimately changing the RNG value. Naive off-chain solutions are opaque and provide no proof that the RNG value produced is legitimate and has not been manipulated by either the data source or oracle node. Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) overcomes these issues by providing smart contracts with a secure source of randomness backed by a cryptographic proof that cannot be manipulated by oracle nodes, users, or development teams. Chainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node’s pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. Consuming smart contracts will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof. This provides users with automated and publicly verifiable assurances directly on-chain that each smart contract application using Chainlink VRF for randomness is provably fair. Verifiable randomness can be used across a wide of use cases including dynamic NFTs, on-chain gaming applications, off-chain systems, and beyond. Chainlink VRF provides smart contracts a secure source of randomness Automation Smart contracts are pieces of code that run deterministically on the blockchain. However, they are “asleep” by default and must be “awoken” by some external entity to perform on-chain functions and change contract states. Chainlink Automation provides smart contract developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a solution to this problem through a highly reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient decentralized network of nodes that can automate any smart contract function and perform regular contract maintenance. Chainlink Automation can be used for a wide range of smart contract functions including executing limit orders on a DEX, minting new tokens when a reserve increases in value, harvesting yield from a vault, rebasing elastic supply tokens, triggering automated trading strategies, liquidating undercollateralized loans, releasing vesting tokens, topping up token balances falling below a threshold, and much more. Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) It’s unlikely that one blockchain will come to dominate the entire smart contract market, especially when considering throughput limitations, jurisdictional differences, and specialization of chains. Such a multi-blockchain universe means that blockchains must cross-communicate with one another. However, due to their inherent security properties, blockchains cannot natively access data on other blockchain networks, a very similar issue to the oracle problem. Chainlink oracles can be used to bridge this gap by reading data on one blockchain and writing the results on another as a means of triggering some type of cross-chain interactions and/or simply an on-chain transaction on the chain requesting the information. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard that will provide a secure, decentralized, and expandable cross-chain messaging solution that will enable smart contracts on any blockchain network to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across any other blockchain network. In addition to generalized message passing between chains, CCIP enables the creation of cross-chain bridges such as the Programmable Token Bridge reference implementation, allowing for the transfers of tokens along with commands to any other blockchain network. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enables the creation of cross-chain applications. Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) While Chainlink oracles are commonly recognized for their ability to fetch and deliver data from the real world on-chain in a reliable and secure manner, they can also perform various off-chain computations including the ordering of transactions. Chainlink’s development of Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) will allow decentralized applications to mitigate Miner Extractable Value (MEV) by ensuring transaction ordering cannot be manipulated by miners as a means of siphoning value from users. Additionally, by preventing front-running attacks, gas costs can be drastically reduced and DEXs can become more trustworthy (e.g. trades are honored according to fairer rules like their arrival in the mempool). Chainlink Fair Sequencing Services enables the fair ordering of transactions to mitigate issues caused by miner extractable value (MEV) Blockchain Gas Price In order to prevent spam attacks, transactions on smart contract-enabled blockchains require the gas fees in the native token to pay for the cost miners expend to validate a transaction. However, the market that determines gas prices happens off-chain and thus smart contracts require an oracle to fetch the current cost per unit of gas. An example of this in action is ETHA Lend, an on-chain yield optimizer that uses the Chainlink gas price oracle to help build and execute algorithmically optimized yield strategies for LPs. Smart contracts can also use this gas price oracle to create gas price financial products and other financial products designed for hedging against blockchain network congestion and high transaction costs. Fair Participant Selection With the advent of blockchain-based public sales, many projects are looking for ways to fairly choose the order of sale participants beyond the common “first come, first serve”’ model, which can be easily manipulated. Initially popularized by centralized exchanges, there is an increasing shift towards a randomized-based selection of sale participants within smart contracts. One example is Centaur, a DeFi platform that uses Chainlink VRF to determine the participants in an on-chain public sale. Based on a list of addresses accumulated before the sale, Chainlink VRF determines in a verifiable and fair manner which addresses from that list are allowed to participate in the on-chain public sale. Centaur uses Chainlink VRF to select participants in an on-chain public sale, ensuring equal opportunity of access Another example is Get Protocol, a blockchain-based event ticketing solution that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly determine a digital waiting line for in-demand concerts and events. This provides users with an equal opportunity to obtain tickets, in a manner they can independently verify on-chain as unbiased. Random Node Selection Some protocols use unpredictability as a form of security, for example by randomly choosing validators for block production. An insecure source of randomness would allow malicious actors to overly insert themselves into the process and manipulate the production of blocks, possibly even bringing the network to a halt. Chainlink VRF can be used as a tamper-proof source of randomness to fairly choose validators each time a block of transactions needs to be produced, protecting blockchain networks from a large category of key attack vectors. Conclusion As a generalized framework for building decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink provides developers the tools they need to connect their smart contract applications to any real-world data or events required for their use case. While the use cases listed above are not an exhaustive list, as there is an infinite number of smart contract use cases made possible by Chainlink, we believe they provide a starting point for developers who are interested in building new innovative decentralized applications.

    "content": "NFTs are fast becoming a vital type of digital asset. The rise in their popularity signals that blockchains are moving beyond cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, governance tokens, and utility tokens to break into today’s cultural zeitgeist—with these unique digital collectibles seeing growing adoption across media, entertainment, music, sports, and more. Whether you’re a creator looking for new ways to monetize your creativity using cutting-edge technology or a pioneering collector breaking into Web3 for the first time, this simple, step-by-step tutorial teaches you how to mint (create) your first NFT. To follow along with this tutorial, you should already be familiar with the MetaMask (or any other OpenSea-compatible) wallet. What Is an NFT? Before looking into how to create an NFT, it’s essential to understand exactly what an NFT is. NFTs are non-fungible, or unique, tokens, which means that no two NFTs are ever the same, even if they might look the same. This is because each NFT has a unique identifier. You can think of this like a barcode. Even if the same image is attached to two different NFTs, you’ll be able to tell the difference by their barcodes. This is also what makes NFT extremely powerful for creators. In the past, you could copy digital art endlessly, and there was no way to tell one file from the other. Now there is—and that’s just scratching the surface of what makes NFTs a paradigm-shifting technology. To dive deeper into the technical aspects of NFTs and what they can do, check out What Is an NFT? What Does It Mean To “Mint” an NFT? Minting an NFT means creating a unique token on a blockchain. Only after minting an NFT is the digital collectible stored on the blockchain. It’s important to know what is being stored during the minting process. It could be an entire work of art, in which case the entirety of the NFT and its metadata is stored “on-chain,” or it could be a reference to information stored off-chain using a tool like IPFS. Regardless of the data being stored, the simplest way to think about minting is as the process of creating an NFT. Minting Your NFT So you’ve decided you’d like to mint your first NFT. How do you get started? You could use an NFT marketplace like OpenSea or mint directly onto the blockchain via a smart contract. Let’s take a look at both methods. Minting an NFT on OpenSea Minting an NFT on OpenSea is straightforward. It consists of two steps. Connect your wallet to OpenSea. Click “create” and fill in the relevant information. Note, if you don’t have a collection, you may need to create that first. There are instructions in the “Collection” section to help. If you want a more programmatic approach to minting NFTs, deploying a smart contract to a blockchain like Ethereum could be a better option. Minting Directly From Smart Contracts Check if the contract has been verified. If you come across a contract for an NFT project and want to mint directly from a tool like Etherscan, you can do that if the contract has been verified. The checkmark next to “Contract” is the first thing to look for. This means the contract is verified. If the contract has been verified, you should be able to interact with it from Etherscan directly. 2. Follow the GIF tutorial below. You’ll need to select “Contract” then “Write Contract.” Once there, you should see the functions you can interact with. You’ll be looking for the mint function; it might be named safeMint. After you connect your wallet and provide your address, you should be able to mint the NFT to your wallet. Follow along with the GIF below to get started. Minting NFTs by Creating a Smart Contract Building smart contracts to mint NFTs is a more in-depth topic. The tutorials below will walk you through the various processes. How To Create an NFT Game How To Create an NFT How To Build an NFT Marketplace With Solidity and Hardhat How To Create Generative Art NFTs How To Create NFT Domain Names Build, Deploy, and Sell Your Own Dynamic NFT How to Build Dynamic NFTs on Polygon Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How much will it cost to mint an NFT? The cost of minting an NFT depends on the method you use and the state of the network at the time you’re minting. If cost is a concern, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea have a “lazy minting” function, which enables you to sell an NFT before it’s minted—with the buyer paying the cost. How can I sell my NFT? Selling an NFT is simple if you use an NFT marketplace. For example, OpenSea, Nifty GateWay, Rarible, SuperRare, and X2Y2 are all prominent NFT marketplaces many NFT creators use to sell NFTs. How do I mint an NFT on another blockchain? The NFT minting process is very similar for other blockchains if you mint an NFT through marketplaces like OpenSea. However, there may be blockchains that are not supported by a specific marketplace. A good place to find more information on which blockchains are supported is a marketplace’s help page.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this technical tutorial, learn how to deploy smart contracts on the Solana blockchain that use Chainlink Price Feeds to access secure market data.\n\n",
    "content": "If you want to learn how to develop Solana smart contracts and programs, then you’ve come to the right place. Solana is an emerging high-performance, permissionless blockchain that offers fast, cheap, and scalable transactions and supports smart contracts being built with the Rust, C++, and C programming languages. In this technical article, we’ll go through examples of writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Solana Devnet cluster, as well as how to use Chainlink Price Feeds in your Solana smart contracts. Solana’s Architecture and Programming Model Solana is a high-performance blockchain capable of thousands of transactions per second and sub-second block times. It achieves this via a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism that makes use of a new innovative cryptographic function called Proof of History. Proof of History Proof of History (PoH) establishes a cryptographically verifiable order of events (in this case transactions) over time via the use of a high-frequency verifiable delay function, or VDF. Essentially this means PoH is like a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes. Much like how an ancient water clock can record the passage of time by observing rising water levels, Proof of History’s sequential outputs of constant hashed blockchain state give a verifiable order of events over time. This helps the performance of the network by allowing the ordered events to then be processed in parallel, as opposed to a traditional blockchain scenario where a single process verifies and bundles up all the transactions to be included in the next block. A simple analogy would be to imagine a large 100-piece puzzle. In a normal scenario it would take one or more people a certain amount of time to complete the puzzle. But imagine if beforehand the puzzle pieces were all stamped with a number corresponding to their position, from top left to bottom right of the puzzle, and laid out in a line in sequential order. Because the exact order of puzzle pieces and their position in the puzzle is known beforehand, the puzzle can be solved quicker by having multiple people focus on a section each. This is the effect that having a verifiable sequence of events over time has on the consensus mechanism; it allows the processing to be broken up into multiple parallel processes. Smart Contract Architecture Solana offers a different smart contract model to traditional EVM-based blockchains. In traditional EVM-based chains, contract code/logic and state are combined into a single contract deployed on-chain. With Solana, a smart contract (or program) is read-only or stateless and contains just program logic. Once deployed, smart contracts can be interacted with by external accounts. The accounts that interact with the programs store data related to program interaction. This creates a logical separation of state (accounts) and contract logic (programs). This is the crucial difference between Solana and EVM-based smart contracts. Accounts on Ethereum are not the same as accounts on Solana. Solana accounts can store data (including wallet information) as opposed to Ethereum accounts, which are references to people’s wallets. In addition to this, Solana offers a CLI and JSON RPC API that can be used by decentralized applications to interact with the Solana blockchain. They can also use one of the existing SDKs, which allow clients to talk to the blockchain and Solana programs. High-level representation of the Solana development workflow. Source: Solana documentation Deploying Your First Solana Smart Contract In this section, you’ll create and deploy your first ‘hello world’ Solana program, written in Rust. Requirements The following should be installed before proceeding: NodeJS v14 or greater \u0026 NPM The latest stable Rust build Solana CLI v1.7.11 or later Git The HelloWorld Program The HelloWorld program is a smart contract that prints output to the console and counts the number of times the program has been called for a given account, storing the number on-chain. Let’s break down the code into separate sections. The first section defines some standard Solana program parameters and defines an entry point for the program (the ‘process_instruction’ function). In addition to this, it uses borsh for serializing and deserializing parameters being passed to and from the deployed program. use borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\r\nuse solana_program::{\r\n    account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},\r\n    entrypoint,\r\n    entrypoint::ProgramResult,\r\n    msg,\r\n    program_error::ProgramError,\r\n    pubkey::Pubkey,\r\n};\r\n\r\n/// Define the type of state stored in accounts\r\n#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]\r\npub struct GreetingAccount {\r\n    /// number of greetings\r\n    pub counter: u32,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Declare and export the program\u0027s entrypoint\r\nentrypoint!(process_instruction);\r\n The process_instruction function accepts the program_id, which is the public key where the program is deployed to, and accountInfo, which is the account to say hello to. pub fn process_instruction(\r\n    program_id: \u0026Pubkey, // Public key of the account the hello world program was loaded into\r\n    accounts: \u0026[AccountInfo], // The account to say hello to\r\n    _instruction_data: \u0026[u8], // Ignored, all helloworld instructions are hellos\r\n The ProgramResult is where the main logic of the program resides. In this case, it simply prints a message, then selects the accounts by looping through ‘accounts’. However, in our example there will only be one account.     ) -\u003e ProgramResult {\r\n    msg!(\"Hello World Rust program entrypoint\");\r\n\r\n    // Iterating accounts is safer then indexing\r\n    let accounts_iter \u003d \u0026mut accounts.iter();\r\n\r\n    // Get the account to say hello to\r\n    let account \u003d next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;\r\n Next, the program checks to see if the account has permission to modify the data for the specified account.     // The account must be owned by the program in order to modify its data\r\n    if account.owner !\u003d program_id {\r\n        msg!(\"Greeted account does not have the correct program id\");\r\n        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);\r\n    }\r\n Finally, the function takes the existing account’s stored number, increases the value by one, writes the result back, and displays a message.     // Increment and store the number of times the account has been greeted\r\n    let mut greeting_account \u003d GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(\u0026account.data.borrow())?;\r\n    greeting_account.counter +\u003d 1;\r\n    greeting_account.serialize(\u0026mut \u0026mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;\r\n\r\n    msg!(\"Greeted {} time(s)!\", greeting_account.counter);\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n Deploying the Program The first step is to clone the repository. git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld\r\ncd example-helloworld\r\n Once this is done, you can then set your current environment to devnet. This is the test network for Solana developers writing and testing smart contracts.  solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com\r\n Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet. Take note: this is an insecure method for storing keys and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter in a passphrase for security reasons.  solana-keygen new --force\r\n Now that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your smart contract. This command requests SOL tokens into your newly generated account:  solana airdrop 2 \r\n You’re now ready to build the hello world program. You can build it by running the following command npm run build:program-rust\r\n Compiling the program Once the program has been built, you can then deploy it to devnet. The previous command’s output will give you the command that you need to run, but it should look something similar to the following:  solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so\r\n The end result is that you have successfully deployed the hello world program to devnet with an assigned program Id. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer. Deploying the program Viewing the deployed program on the Devnet explorer Interacting With the Deployed Program To interact with the deployed program, the hello-world repository contains a simple client. This client is written in Typescript using the Solana web3.js SDK and the Solana RPC API. The Client The client entry point is the main.ts file, which performs a number of tasks in a specific order, most of which are contained within the hello_world.ts file. First, the client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling the ‘establishConnection’ function export async function establishConnection(): Promise {\r\n  const rpcUrl \u003d await getRpcUrl();\r\n  connection \u003d new Connection(rpcUrl, \u0027confirmed\u0027);\r\n  const version \u003d await connection.getVersion();\r\n  console.log(\u0027Connection to cluster established:\u0027, rpcUrl, version);\r\n}\r\n It then calls the ‘establishPayer’ function to ensure there is an account available to pay for transactions, and creates one if required. export async function establishPayer(): Promise {\r\n  let fees \u003d 0;\r\n  if (!payer) {\r\n    const {feeCalculator} \u003d await connection.getRecentBlockhash();\r\n\r\n    // Calculate the cost to fund the greeter account\r\n    fees +\u003d await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(GREETING_SIZE);\r\n\r\n    // Calculate the cost of sending transactions\r\n    fees +\u003d feeCalculator.lamportsPerSignature * 100; // wag\r\n\r\n    payer \u003d await getPayer();\r\n  }\r\n The client then calls the ‘checkProgram’ function, which loads the keypair of the deployed program from ./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json and uses the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn’t exist, the client stops with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner to store the program state, which in this case is the number of times the program has been executed.  export async function checkProgram(): Promise {\r\n  // Read program id from keypair file\r\n  try {\r\n    const programKeypair \u003d await createKeypairFromFile(PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_PATH);\r\n    programId \u003d programKeypair.publicKey;\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    const errMsg \u003d (err as Error).message;\r\n    throw new Error(\r\n      `Failed to read program keypair at \u0027${PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_PATH}\u0027 due to error: ${errMsg}. Program may need to be deployed with \\`solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so\\``,\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Check if the program has been deployed\r\n  const programInfo \u003d await connection.getAccountInfo(programId);\r\n  if (programInfo \u003d\u003d\u003d null) {\r\n    if (fs.existsSync(PROGRAM_SO_PATH)) {\r\n      throw new Error(\r\n        \u0027Program needs to be deployed with `solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so`\u0027,\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      throw new Error(\u0027Program needs to be built and deployed\u0027);\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (!programInfo.executable) {\r\n    throw new Error(`Program is not executable`);\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(`Using program ${programId.toBase58()}`);\r\n\r\n  // Derive the address (public key) of a greeting account from the program so that it\u0027s easy to find later.\r\n  const GREETING_SEED \u003d \u0027hello\u0027;\r\n  greetedPubkey \u003d await PublicKey.createWithSeed(\r\n    payer.publicKey,\r\n    GREETING_SEED,\r\n    programId,\r\n  );\r\n The client then builds up and sends a ‘hello’ transaction to the program by calling the ‘sayHello’ function. The transaction contains an instruction that holds the public key of the helloworld program account to call, and the account to which the client wishes to say hello to. Each time the client performs this transaction to an account, the program increments a count in the destination account’s data storage.  \r\n  export async function sayHello(): Promise {\r\n  console.log(\u0027Saying hello to\u0027, greetedPubkey.toBase58());\r\n  const instruction \u003d new TransactionInstruction({\r\n    keys: [{pubkey: greetedPubkey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true}],\r\n    programId,\r\n    data: Buffer.alloc(0), // All instructions are hellos\r\n  });\r\n  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(\r\n    connection,\r\n    new Transaction().add(instruction),\r\n    [payer],\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n Finally, the client queries the account’s data to retrieve the current number of times the account has had the sayHello transaction called, by calling ‘reportGreetings’  export async function reportGreetings(): Promise {\r\n  const accountInfo \u003d await connection.getAccountInfo(greetedPubkey);\r\n  if (accountInfo \u003d\u003d\u003d null) {\r\n    throw \u0027Error: cannot find the greeted account\u0027;\r\n  }\r\n  const greeting \u003d borsh.deserialize(\r\n    GreetingSchema,\r\n    GreetingAccount,\r\n    accountInfo.data,\r\n  );\r\n  console.log(\r\n    greetedPubkey.toBase58(),\r\n    \u0027has been greeted\u0027,\r\n    greeting.counter,\r\n    \u0027time(s)\u0027,\r\n  );\r\n Running the Client Before you can run the client to read data from your deployed program, you need to install the client dependencies. npm install\r\n Once this is done, you can start the client. npm run start\r\n You should see output showing your program successfully being executed, and it should display the number of times the account has been greeted. Subsequent runs should increase this number. Starting the Hello World client to interact with the deployed program Congratulations, you’ve deployed and interacted with a Solana smart contract on the devnet network! Now we’ll dive into another example Solana program and client, except this time we’ll make use of Chainlink Price Feeds. Chainlink Price Feeds on Solana The ecosystem of DeFi apps on Solana is growing at an accelerating rate. In order to power basic DeFi mechanisms and execute key on-chain functions, such as issuing loans at fair market prices or liquidating undercollateralized positions, these dApps need access to highly reliable and high-quality market data. Solana has integrated Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana Devnet, offering developers highly decentralized, high-quality, high-speed price reference data updates for building hybrid smart contracts. When combined with Solana’s ability to support up to 65,000 transactions per second and its extremely low transaction fees, Chainlink Price Feeds have the potential to empower DeFi protocol infrastructure that can compete with traditional financial systems in terms of trade execution and risk management quality. In this next code example, we’ll deploy and interact with a Solana program that makes use of Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana devnet cluster. Requirements NodeJS v14 or greater \u0026 NPM The latest stable Rust build Solana CLI v1.7.11 or later Git The Chainlink Solana Starter Kit The Solana Starter Kit is a pre-packaged repository that contains a smart contract that simply connects to a Chainlink Price Feed account on devnet, and retrieves and stores the latest price of the specified price pair into an account, which is then read by an off-chain client. The starter kit uses the Anchor framework, a framework that helps abstract some of the complexities with building smart contracts on Solana. Chainlink Price Feeds on Solana all utilize a single program, with each individual price feed being a separate account that stores price updates using the program. The way this demo works is an off-chain client passes in an account to the on-chain program, the on-chain program then obtains the latest price for the specified price feed, and stores the value in the passed in account. Finally, the off-chain client then reads the price data from the account. The first section of the the smart contract consists of normal includes and declaring using the Anchor framework. It also declares the program ID as required by Anchor. In addition to this, a struct is defined for storing price feed answers into the passed in account, as well as a `fmt` function for formatting the price data retrieved. use anchor_lang::prelude::*;\r\nuse anchor_lang::solana_program::system_program;\r\n\r\nuse chainlink_solana as chainlink;\r\n\r\ndeclare_id!(\"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\");\r\n\r\n#[account]\r\npub struct Decimal {\r\n    pub value: i128,\r\n    pub decimals: u32,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Decimal {\r\n    pub fn new(value: i128, decimals: u32) -\u003e Self {\r\n        Decimal { value, decimals }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl std::fmt::Display for Decimal {\r\n    fn fmt(\u0026self, f: \u0026mut std::fmt::Formatter\u003c\u0027_\u003e) -\u003e std::fmt::Result {\r\n        let mut scaled_val \u003d self.value.to_string();\r\n        if scaled_val.len() \u003c\u003d self.decimals as usize {\r\n            scaled_val.insert_str(\r\n                0,\r\n                \u0026vec![\"0\"; self.decimals as usize - scaled_val.len()].join(\"\"),\r\n            );\r\n            scaled_val.insert_str(0, \"0.\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            scaled_val.insert(scaled_val.len() - self.decimals as usize, \u0027.\u0027);\r\n        }\r\n        f.write_str(\u0026scaled_val)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n Next, the program declares a `chainlink_solana_demo` module to be used for obtaining price data, which contains the `execute` function. The `execute` function is the part of the program that contains the main logic for the smart contract. It retrieves the latest round data from the specified feed address by calling the `latest_round_data` function from the chainlink-solana package, which gets imported from GitHub via the Cargo.toml file. The function finishes by formatting and storing the price against the specified account passed into the program, and writing the result out to the program output. #[program]\r\npub mod chainlink_solana_demo {\r\n    use super::*;\r\n        pub fn execute(ctx: Context) -\u003e ProgramResult  {\r\n        let round \u003d chainlink::latest_round_data(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        let description \u003d chainlink::description(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        let decimals \u003d chainlink::decimals(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        // Set the account value\r\n        let decimal: \u0026mut Account \u003d \u0026mut ctx.accounts.decimal;\r\n        decimal.value\u003dround.answer;\r\n        decimal.decimals\u003du32::from(decimals);\r\n\r\n        // Also print the value to the program output\r\n        let decimal_print \u003d Decimal::new(round.answer, u32::from(decimals));\r\n        msg!(\"{} price is {}\", description, decimal_print);\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n Deploying the Program The first step is to clone the repository. git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit\r\ncd solana-starter-kit\r\n Once this is done, you can install the required dependencies, including the Anchor framework. npm install\r\n Note for Apple M1 chipsets: You will need to perform an extra step to get the Anchor framework installed manually from source, as the NPM package only support x86_64 chipsets currently, please run the following command to install it manually: cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.20.1 anchor-cli --locked Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet cluster. Again, this is an insecure method for storing keys, and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for security reasons. solana-keygen new -o id.json\r\n Now that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your program. This command requests SOL tokens for your newly generated account. We will need to call this twice, because the Devnet faucet is limited to 2 SOL, and we need approximately 4 SOL. solana airdrop 2 $(solana-keygen pubkey ./id.json) --url https://api.devnet.solana.com \u0026\u0026 solana airdrop 2 $(solana-keygen pubkey ./id.json) --url https://api.devnet.solana.com\r\n You’re now ready to build the Chainlink Solana Demo program using the Anchor framework! anchor build\r\n Building the program with Anchor The build process generates the keypair for your program’s account. Before you deploy your program, you must add this public key to your lib.rs file, as it’s it’s required by programs that make use of Anchor. To do this, you need to get the keypair from the ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json file that Anchor generated using the following command: solana address -k ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json\r\n The next step is to edit the lib.rs file and replace the keypair in the declare_id!() definition with the value you obtained from the previous step: declare_id!(\"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\"); Next, you also need to insert the obtained Program ID value into the Anchor.toml file in the chainlink_solana_demo devnet definition [programs.devnet]\r\nchainlink_solana_demo \u003d \"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\"\r\n Finally, because you updated the source code with the generated program ID, you need to rebuild the program again, and then it can be deployed to devnet anchor build\r\nanchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet\r\n Deploying the program with Anchor Once you have successfully deployed the program, the terminal output will specify the program ID of the program, it should match the value you inserted into the lib.rs file and the Anchor.toml file. Once again, take note of this Program ID, as it will be required when executing the client. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer. Viewing the deployed program on the Solana Devnet explorer Interacting With the Deployed Program To interact with the deployed program, the Chainlink Solana Demo repository contains a client written in JavaScript using the Anchor framework and the Solana web3 API. The Client The client is a JavaScript script that takes two parameters, a deployed program ID, and a Price Feed account address. It then creates a connection to the deployed program and passes in the specified price feed account and an account to store the retrieved price data. Once the on-chain program execution has completed, it simply reads the price data from the account that was passed into the program. First, the client establishes a connection with the cluster using Anchor and sets up some required parameters, such as pulling in command line arguments and setting of default values: const args \u003d require(\u0027minimist\u0027)(process.argv.slice(2));\r\n\r\n// Initialize Anchor and provider\r\nconst anchor \u003d require(\"@project-serum/anchor\");\r\nconst provider \u003d anchor.Provider.env();\r\n// Configure the cluster.\r\nanchor.setProvider(provider);\r\n\r\nconst CHAINLINK_PROGRAM_ID \u003d \"HEvSKofvBgfaexv23kMabbYqxasxU3mQ4ibBMEmJWHny\";\r\nconst DIVISOR \u003d 100000000;\r\n\r\n// Data feed account address\r\n// Default is SOL / USD\r\nconst default_feed \u003d \"HgTtcbcmp5BeThax5AU8vg4VwK79qAvAKKFMs8txMLW6\";\r\nconst CHAINLINK_FEED \u003d args[\u0027feed\u0027] || default_feed;\r\n After this, the main function of the client is defined. This is the function that does everything described above. First, it connects to our deployed program using the Anchor framework. It then generates a new account and calls the `execute` function in the deployed program, passing in the following details: The account created to store the price data The account of the user running the client (to pay transaction fees) The specified price feed account address The program ID of the Chainlink Price Feeds on devnet. This is a static value that doesn’t need to be modified The Solana system program account address. Once again, this value is static async function main() {\r\n  // Read the generated IDL.\r\n  const idl \u003d JSON.parse(\r\n    require(\"fs\").readFileSync(\"./target/idl/chainlink_solana_demo.json\", \"utf8\")\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // Address of the deployed program.\r\n  const programId \u003d new anchor.web3.PublicKey(args[\u0027program\u0027]);\r\n\r\n  // Generate the program client from IDL.\r\n  const program \u003d new anchor.Program(idl, programId);\r\n\r\n  //create an account to store the price data\r\n  const priceFeedAccount \u003d anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();\r\n\r\n  console.log(\u0027priceFeedAccount public key: \u0027 + priceFeedAccount.publicKey);\r\n  console.log(\u0027user public key: \u0027 + provider.wallet.publicKey);\r\n\r\n  // Execute the RPC.\r\n  let tx \u003d await program.rpc.execute({\r\n    accounts: {\r\n      decimal: priceFeedAccount.publicKey,\r\n      user: provider.wallet.publicKey,\r\n      chainlinkFeed: CHAINLINK_FEED,\r\n      chainlinkProgram: CHAINLINK_PROGRAM_ID,\r\n      systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId\r\n    },\r\n    options: { commitment: \"confirmed\" },\r\n    signers: [priceFeedAccount],\r\n  });\r\n The client then waits to get a confirmed transaction and then outputs the program output onto the console. This displays information about the transaction, including the printed output from the on-chain program. Finally, the program reads the price data from the priceFeed account that was passed into the program, and then outputs the value to the console. console.log(\"Fetching transaction logs...\");\r\n  let t \u003d await provider.connection.getConfirmedTransaction(tx, \"confirmed\");\r\n  console.log(t.meta.logMessages);\r\n  // #endregion main\r\n\r\n  // Fetch the account details of the account containing the price data\r\n  const latestPrice \u003d await program.account.decimal.fetch(priceFeedAccount.publicKey);\r\n  console.log(\u0027Price Is: \u0027 + latestPrice.value / DIVISOR)\r\n Running the Client The first step is to set the Anchor environment variables. These are required by the Anchor framework to determine which Provider to use, as well as which Wallet to use for interacting with the deployed program. In this case, we’re setting the value to the default devnet provider URL, and the wallet that we created earlier: export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL\u003d\u0027https://api.devnet.solana.com\u0027\r\nexport ANCHOR_WALLET\u003d\u0027./id.json\u0027\r\n Once this is done, we are ready to run the JavaScript client. Be sure to pass the program ID obtained from the previous steps by using the –program flag linking to the json file containing the account that owns the program. We also need to pass in the Chainlink feed address that we wish to query. This can be taken from the Chainlink Solana Feeds page, and the value will be defaulted to the devnet SOL/USD feed address if you don’t specify a value. In this example, we’re explicitly specifying the SOL/USD feed to show how the feed parameter works: node client.js --program $(solana address -k ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json) -–feed  HgTtcbcmp5BeThax5AU8vg4VwK79qAvAKKFMs8txMLW6\r\n You should see output showing the client successfully being executed, and it should display the latest price from the specified price feed, stored in the new account: Executing the client Summary Solana offers a high-speed, low-cost, scalable blockchain for building smart contracts and decentralized applications. By leveraging Solana smart contracts and Chainlink Price Feeds, developers can create fast, scalable DeFi applications, taking advantage of the high-quality data offered by Chainlink Price Feeds and the high-speed updates available on the Solana blockchain.

    "content": "Special thanks to Adrian Hetman, Alejandro Munoz-McDonald, Ivan Benavides, and Leon Spacewalker. Hunting for smart contract bugs can be a ludicrously well-paying job, and it’s also an integral part of protecting the ecosystem from hacks. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing a developer who found a $7 billion dollar bug—and was paid $2.2M for reporting it. In this blog, we’re going to go through the bug that this developer found and how it had the potential to compromise $7b in value before offering some strategies and tools that will help you find bugs. Let’s dive in. Polygon Smart Contract Bug Example Build Up On May 31, 2020, the Matic blockchain went live (Matic would later be rebranded as Polygon). Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain known for it’s low gas fees and short block time. The chain has recently begun exploring zk-rollup technology. If you take a look at block 0 of Polygon, the absolute first block of the blockchain, also known as its “genesis” block, you’ll see 10 transactions. One of these transactions created a contract called MRC20. Polygon genesis block. What is this contract? When we send a native blockchain token we have to spend gas to do so. So the Polygon team deployed a contract that allows you to sign a transaction to send someone ETH, with someone else able to pay the gas fee for this transaction. Known as a “meta transaction,” this capability was popularized with the introduction of EIP-712. You can see that this contract was given almost 10 billion MATIC tokens in order to help facilitate these gasless transactions. However, this clever contract contained a vulnerability that could have potentially been exploited to drain the entire balance! On December 3rd, 2021 the hero of the story, pseudo-anon developer Leon Spacewalker, submitted a report to the Immunefi bug bounty program laying out the details of this exact function. A second hero, who we will just call Whitehat2, also reported the vulnerability a day later. Around 800,000 MATIC tokens were stolen before the chain was finally forked, rolled back, and fixed December 5th, 2021. This leaves us with some more questions: What was the vulnerability? How did it stay undiscovered for so long? How was it found? The Exploit Below is the function that facilitates these gasless transactions.    function transferWithSig(\r\n       bytes calldata sig,\r\n       uint256 amount,\r\n       bytes32 data,\r\n       uint256 expiration,\r\n       address to\r\n   ) external returns (address from) {\r\n       require(amount \u003e 0);\r\n       require(\r\n           expiration \u003d\u003d 0 || block.number \u003c\u003d expiration,\r\n           \"Signature is expired\"\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       bytes32 dataHash \u003d getTokenTransferOrderHash(\r\n           msg.sender,\r\n           amount,\r\n           data,\r\n           expiration\r\n       );\r\n       require(disabledHashes[dataHash] \u003d\u003d false, \"Sig deactivated\");\r\n       disabledHashes[dataHash] \u003d true;\r\n\r\n       from \u003d ecrecovery(dataHash, sig);\r\n\r\n       _transferFrom(from, address(uint160(to)), amount);\r\n   } At first glance, it seems harmless: It takes the signature of the user, how many tokens and who they want to send them to, and any further data, along with an expiration date for the transaction. It runs some requires, gets the data hash in order to send the meta transaction, makes sure the data hash hasn’t been used, and does this ecrecovery function. This function is essentially a wrapper for the Solidity ecrecover function. Solidity ecrecover function wrapper. This function is how we can verify where signed transactions are coming from. You’ll notice, even in the Solidity documentation, it says it will “return zero on error”. The ecrecovery function copied this, and if it had an issue, it would return 0. Which, as many developers know, can be scary. If it returns zero on error, that means that we should check to make sure that the returned address isn’t zero, right? Here’s the actual code: Here’s what should probably be there: So we don’t perform a check on the address to make sure it didn’t result in an error. Not a problem. The last line of code in our transferWithSig function does the actual transfer, surely we will perform some sort of check there, right? function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\r\n   internal\r\n{\r\n   require(recipient !\u003d address(this), \"can\u0027t send to MRC20\");\r\n   address(uint160(recipient)).transfer(amount); // It just sends the money!\r\n   emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\r\n} The _transferFrom function just called our _transfer function, shown above. You’ll notice it doesn’t check to make sure the from address has enough money. This means that someone could send an invalid signature, which would result in a zero address returned from ecrecovery, but the MRC20 contract would still send the to address an amount of money. This is how that 9,999,993,000 MATIC could be drained, since the MRC20 contract sends the money directly from itself! A check to make sure that the from address has enough money for this signed transaction would have prevented this issue. How Did the Smart Contract Bug Elude Discovery for So Long? What’s odd to me is that, after the vulnerability laying dormant for almost a year and a half, it was discovered by Leon, another white hat, and a hacker within the span of a few days. Seems fishy. But the Immunefi team told me this can often happen. Some exploits can become popular based on an article, write-up, or challenge and people then start looking for that vulnerability, resulting in several people finding it at the same time. But more likely is that it turns out that polygon verified the contract on Polygonscan around this time – so that was when people really started to look at it. Maybe there is more to the story, but maybe not. In any case, let’s use this bug as a teachable moment and look at some of the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find bugs, helping protect the Web3 ecosystem. Top 7 Strategies Now, we are going to learn the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find these vulnerabilities and claim bug bounties. This list of tips assumes you already know the basics of smart contracts, so yes, learning Solidity is a prerequisite. Use these superpowers for ethical hacking, and please remember to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find. A lot of the work of finding vulnerabilities comes from looking at the code and running tools like slither. For this $2.2M payout, Leon said he was able to find the bug by looking line-by-line at the smart contract code, so remember, finding vulnerabilities is often a huge manual lift! In addition to the practical tips below, Leon’s biggest takeaway was for smart contract bug hunters to “find your edge,” but what does he mean by that? Typically, this means finding that thing that sets you apart from other hackers. We as a community need to cover every corner of the smart contract space, so find a section that you are specifically good at and excel. Here are the seven strategies and tips to help find your edge, to make you a successful smart contract bug hunter. 1. Find a Project and Search For Bugs The first way you can find bugs is to know every inch of how a protocol works. This is one of the first skills every smart contract bug hunter needs to be learn: the ability to understand a protocol end to end. Go through docs, try to reimplement a protocol yourself, and view transactions through that protocol on a block explorer. Leon said this strategy works for other hunters but not him. He focuses on the next three, but it’s important for every bug hunter to be able to do this. 2. Find a Bug and Search For Projects An easier approach to hunting for bugs is to find a bug that not a lot of people know about and try to see which protocols have implemented it. This strategy takes a lot of research, as there are a lot of people working on exposing bugs to the general public. You first need to understand all the basic smart contract exploits, and then their advanced versions. You need to be aware of best practices and see if there are protocols that have not followed them. Once you find a smart contract bug you think a lot of projects might not have protected against, start searching for that bug. Get really familiar with this new bug and how to find it. And be sure to write a blog or some kind of post to help other smart contract developers who run into this bug protect themselves. 3. Be Fast Projects that want bug hunters to look at their smart contracts need to sign up for bug bounty programs like Immunefi. And you’ll want to be one of the first developers to find the new bounties. If you start looking at a contract before other hunters, you’ll have more time to find a bug than other hunters. There are a few ways to be fast—one of the ways Leon was able to find the smart contract vulnerability before others was by having notifications on for the Immunifi updates Discord channel. He received a notification anytime a new project came in, or a project was updated. Tools like this can help you get to digging into code before anyone else does. 4. Be Creative Another way Leon was able to get an edge, was traversing community forums, and finding out they were thinking about submitting a bug. He’d then start looking at the smart contracts even before the bounty was approved. This gave him way more time to look at a contract than other developers, since they would wait for a bug bounty to be submitted. 5. Know Your Tooling Bug hunters use tools like the VSCode Solidity visual developer extension, Hardhat, Foundry, Brownie, Dune, Etherscan, plus a host of others. A typical bug hunting strategy might be loading up VSCode, adding the code to VSCode with the Solidity visual extension, and going line by line looking for common bugs or bad best practices. After finding a weakness, setting up a testing environment to run tests on the contract is a good next step. You can often reuse a lot of the tests the developers of the protocol originally used. 6. Don’t Be Afraid of Audited Projects Not much else to say here. Audit firms make mistakes. Many of the projects Leon found vulnerabilities for had been audited by top firms. Using the skills we talked about in this blog can be the difference for you to find these issues! 7. Industry-Specific Knowledge One of the biggest advantages in finding your edge is specializing in a specific niche. If you understand one area incredibly well, you’ll have the advantage of knowing how all the functions interact with each other. If you’re a phenomenal smart contract vulnerability expert but don’t know anything about DeFi, it’ll be hard to find vulnerabilities in DeFi contracts. For example, a lot of developers understand code, but don’t understand financial primitives. You could get incredibly good at understanding decentralized exchanges, borrowing protocols, or maybe just NFTs! If you can become a master of security and a master of a certain vertical within Web3, you’ll be well-positioned to have a massive leg up on everyone else looking for bugs. Summary I hope this piece is useful to you in your smart contract bug-hunting journey.

    "content": "Definition: The verifiable web uses blockchain technology, decentralized computing, and cryptography to enforce contractual obligations, provide greater transparency into how systems work, and give users more control over their data, identities, and assets. In early civilizations, truth was based on myth. Observations of worldly phenomena were wrapped in symbolic narratives, religious beliefs, and ancient wisdom. Over time, humanity began to value objective measurements and reasoning, birthing disciplines such as science, mathematics, and logic. After the invention of the written word and, later, the printing press, books and documents captured the world’s information in written form, from academic literature and legal contracts to statistics and opinionated analysis. Then, in the twentieth century, phones, computers, and the Internet started a digital revolution in how information was created, distributed, and verified, with supercomputers now performing large-scale computations on complex data sets and billions of users across the globe generating, sharing, and talking about content every day in real-time. Now, with a simple Internet connection, anyone in the world can instantly access a seemingly infinite flow of information. But while individuals are now empowered to consume and share more information than ever before, high-velocity, high-volume information scattered across a variety of applications poses extraordinary challenges: How can an everyday user make sense of such a vast, complex, and sometimes contradictory information landscape? Information warfare and advancements in AI are only compounding this problem. Information is the basis for sound decision-making by humans, institutions, and systems, and we need a better foundation for obtaining and evaluating it. This new foundation starts by increasing people’s ability to verify the source of information, the method used to calculate it and the integrity of the systems used to do so, and the historical reputation of these sources, methods, and systems. Doing so will require the creation of a more advanced informational and digital age powered by cryptographic truth. We call this the verifiable web. The evolution of truth. What Is the Verifiable Web? The Web Is Flawed In the established web model, the Internet is shared networking infrastructure that enables communication between computers via online applications. Each online application handles its own computing (executing code), storage (storing code and data used and produced), and management (updating code and maintaining a successful business) by either running it in-house or outsourcing it to a centralized company. Users of applications are then responsible for establishing a connection to the Internet in order to interact with the online application, generally by paying for a data or Internet plan. The problem with this model is it directly or indirectly gives centralized entities— whether it’s the application or Internet Service Provider (ISP)—extensive control over online data, computing, and/or networking. This means how the application works can be arbitrarily changed at any time—a social media company quietly changing its algorithm, for example. It also means that user data and connectivity can be arbitrarily censored, omitted, or monetized for personal gain, oftentimes with little user oversight or awareness of how it’s being done. As a result, the user has to trust the application and Internet infrastructure to act in a reliable and honest manner because they have no actual guarantees—just paper promises that take time and money to fight against in court if broken (assuming the user even has access to a high-integrity legal system). With the web extending far beyond information-sharing applications to span financial transactions, health management, election systems, supply chain tracking, and more, fixing it means fixing the nature of almost every digital interaction the modern user has. The stakes couldn’t be higher. A Verification Layer for the Internet The verifiable web is not a replacement for the established web but rather an extension of its capabilities. The verifiable web provides applications with a decentralized, cryptographically secure, and verifiably fair environment for running computations, storing data, governing operations, and facilitating networking across systems. With some or all of an application’s backend infrastructure run on the verifiable web, users are able to obtain proof and guarantees about the application and its data, such as that it’s manipulation-resistant (secure), always available (reliable), permissionlessly accessible (censorship-resistant), logically sound (accurate), authenticated (genuine), private (privacy), and traceable from inception (provenance). Instead of requiring users to trust that an online application will keep its commitments, the verifiable web provides technologically enforced guarantees that users can independently check. By knowing how an application works and that it cannot arbitrarily change, users can make more informed decisions about whether or not to engage with it and whether to disengage at any point in the future. This is because the user is able to know its state at all times with near-complete certainty, including how it makes decisions, how rules are enforced, how data is generated, and what updates will be made. The verifiable web provides verifiable guarantees instead of trust-based promises. The verifiable web is underpinned by game-theoretical design—using the science of strategy to produce desired outcomes. The verifiable web combines various technologies to create game-theoretical environments where rational participants are incentivized to produce fair outcomes (i.e., it’s deterministic), even in the presence of adversaries. Furthermore, users can inspect these environments to check if they meet their own standards of trust and fairness. In contrast, the established web relies on trust in probabilistic and unverifiable promises made by the centralized entity that owns the application or runs its backend infrastructure. For example, central banks manage monetary policy based on subjective assessments while banks manage payment ledgers with relative opaqueness. While there are various reasons for doing so, it is a less predictable process that can create systemic risk. Alternatively, Bitcoin uses a game-theoretical design to incentivize a decentralized network of nodes to manage monetary policy and maintain a payment ledger according to a publicly available set of rules enshrined in the software that nodes on the network run. This provides users with verifiable proof about how the ledger is managed and how difficult it is to tamper with the ledger and alter the monetary policy, ultimately creating more predictable risk management. The verifiable web moves society away from probabilistic promises and toward guaranteed contracts. Why Do We Need the Verifiable Web? The verifiable web is what crypto is really about—it starts with fixing money and financial markets, before expanding into other industries to bring greater proof and transparency to the digital interactions that determine our lives. If trust in institutions continues to decrease, demand for technologies that provide verifiable proof about the world will only increase. Some of the areas of growing distrust that the verifiable web can help to improve include: Cryptographic guarantees restore trust in systems. Financial Markets and Services Financial markets have historically been subject to boom and bust cycles as a result of mispriced asset valuations and resulting systemic risk due to their cross-dependencies. People want better guarantees that financial markets and assets are as healthy as the official reports state, and that financial services will be honored as agreed upon. The verifiable web can be an important tool in providing a golden record across market infrastructure or forcing timely and in-full financial payments, ultimately creating more stability and reducing systemic risk. Images and Videos With the acceleration of AI, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between real and fake images and videos. The spread of fake content is leading to the proliferation of false narratives in society, and, as a side effect, increased skepticism in legitimate sources. The verifiable web can play a key role in authenticating the source of images and videos, such as a camera cryptographically signing a photo/video with a unique private key from an HSM hardware module and then hashing a copy onchain as a tamperproof record of who took the photo/video and when it was taken. Information and Analysis The acceleration of AI and information warfare has also made it hard to filter misinformation and disinformation and decide who to turn to for unbiased analysis. The verifiable web can not only help create a single, globally accessible source of truth about the origin of information, but it can also help establish methods for verifying the track record of news sources and analysts over time and incentivize sound research and analysis. The public has lost trust in news and information sources. Food and Goods As society has become more educated, it has also become more interested in the source and quality of food and goods. However, it can be difficult to verify the true origin of a good or that it’s authentic, hasn’t been diluted, and is backed by a manufacturer with a reliable track record. The verifiable web can help users track and rate food and goods from inception to the storefront with more certainty. Contracts and Legal Systems Having verifiable proof that a contract will be honored is critical to running a reliable business or purchasing a product (e.g., warranties). Unfortunately, contracts are not always strictly enforced, especially when one side has a clear economic and political advantage over their counterparty. The verifiable web can level the playing field by replacing clauses in digital contracts with technologically enforced guarantees via smart contracts and oracle networks. This can help improve trust between people, businesses, and institutions globally, particularly by making the levers that can dictate the outcome of contracts impossible for any party to tamper with. Social Participation and Consensus Obtaining a realistic view of what the public thinks helps institutions and society at large make better decisions. AI, bot farms, and closed-source algorithms make it hard to know whether social consensus derived from online debates, surveys, elections, viewership, and more is real or manipulated. Thus, it’s important for the verifiable web to bring authentication and verifiability to how social consensus is created and gathered, such as by open-sourcing algorithms used in information collection and leveraging manipulation-resistant and privacy-preserving verification systems to prove someone is a unique human without revealing their identity. Technologies That Define How the Verifiable Web Works Below is a list of technologies/technological movements that combine to create the verifiable web. New technologies are also likely to emerge as consumers demand more and more verifiable proof and guarantees about their everyday lives. Open-Source Software Open-source software is software for which the code that defines how it runs is verifiable by anyone. This allows stakeholders using or affected by the software to inspect it before deciding to adopt or update it. As more people independently verify it, the software becomes more secure and trusted to consistently operate in a specific way. Examples: Linux Operating System, Mozilla Firefox, and Apache Web Server Cryptography Cryptography involves the use of verifiable mathematical techniques to secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. In a general sense, cryptography is used to conceal and authenticate information by scrambling it with a cipher, which cannot be cracked in any practical sense (e.g., it would require a prohibitive amount of time and investment), even with the most advanced computing technologies. Cryptography is already widely used across the modern Internet to ensure that users are able to interact with each other without worrying about imposters or middlemen intercepting their communications. Examples: One-Way Hash Functions, Public/Private Key Encryption, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs Blockchains and Smart Contracts Blockchains are distributed ledgers that provide verifiable proof that the tracking of asset ownership is accurate and tamperproof, and that the ability to move assets between users is permissionless and always available. Furthermore, the smart contract applications running on blockchains provide verifiable proof that their code will execute exactly as it is stored onchain. This enables businesses to transact and governance processes to be managed in a distributed manner that is transparent and resistant to manipulation by a single entity. Blockchains make use of a multitude of technological primitives, most notably cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives. As an overview, blockchains use financial rewards and penalties to incentivize a decentralized network of independent nodes to come to an honest consensus about the validity of submitted transactions and to keep the ledger updated and available. Blockchains also use cryptography to authenticate transactions, ensuring they are unique to a specific user. The combination of cryptography and decentralized consensus makes it very difficult to tamper with the network, resulting in a form of cryptographic truth. Examples: Bitcoin, Aave, and ENS Cryptographic truth enables deterministic computing—applications that execute exactly as their code dictates—and golden records—a single source of reliable truth outside of the direct control of any one stakeholder. Oracles Oracles leverage similar primitives of cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives, but for the purpose of creating cryptographic truth around any type of data, computation, or connection between systems. Whereas blockchains are only concerned with verifying the ownership and transfer of tokens or updating smart contracts, oracles can be applied to creating truth and guarantees about anything, such as calculating the fair price of an asset, generating a tamperproof and unbiased random number, or ensuring that an automated task will be completed at a specific time or that value will be securely transferred between systems when a specific event occurs. Oracles can expand cryptographic truth to the verification of almost anything. Examples: Chainlink Data Streams, Functions, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Trusted Hardware Trusted hardware is hardware where the software running inside cannot be tampered with or even observed by either a third party or the hardware operator. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) often generate cryptographic attestations, which give users verifiable proof that the software running inside executed exactly as expected. Although the area still requires more research and development, trusted hardware is an extension of other types of hardware like secure enclaves and hardware security modules (HSMs), which provide a protected environment for storing information or executing code. Examples: Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Keystone Biometrics Authenticating that information came from a specific person or company is critical proof for facilitating certain processes. Biometrics provide a way of authenticating that an action was taken by a specific person by verifying a physical feature unique to them. For example, phones use a person’s fingerprint as verifiable proof that they belong to the owner. Examples: Fingerprint, Iris Recognition, Facial Recognition Reputation Systems While truths or proofs may not always be obtainable in real-time, they can be demonstrated over time through the use of reputation systems. Reputation systems are methods of tracking the historical performance of an entity or process, such as a system’s uptime, the accuracy of a data provider, the correctness of an analyst’s predictions, or the reliability of a user in a help forum. The integrity of reputation systems is further verifiable when they cryptographically sign data that they’re tracking onchain, where it cannot be deleted or altered in the future. Examples: eBay, Stack Exchange, and Ethereum Beacon Chain Validator Rankings Artificial Intelligence As machine learning algorithms and data collection techniques become more advanced, so too does the ability to analyze complex datasets and come to conclusions with a statistically high degree of confidence. One example of this is a project in development by Green World called AIRS, which aims to use satellite remote sensing data with smart contracts to successfully reward stewards of targeted regenerative agriculture. Chainlink oracles are tasked with gathering ground-truthing and satellite data, analyzing it within trusted execution environments for high-trust quantitative metrics, and relaying it to a blockchain to trigger automated payments to stewards. AIRS rewards to stakeholders can take the form of cryptocurrency—readily convertible into local currency—or digital financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of local communities. A Trust Anchor for Society The verifiable web is a much-needed trust anchor for society, whereby vulnerable human decision-making is replaced by unbiased software that enforces honest outcomes and provides verifiable proof of how it arrived at such outcomes. This new superpower enables builders to create applications that are undeniably fair, provably accessible to anyone in the world, and verifiably secure against manipulation. The possibilities are endless, and this paradigm shift couldn’t come at a more pressing time, with society needing verifiable truth about how the world works more than ever. Chainlink is the decentralized computing platform helping power the verifiable web. From startups to leading financial institutions, builders worldwide use Chainlink to power verifiable applications and high-integrity markets.

We will come back to the VRF subscription in the next step. Step 4: Deploy the Dynamic NFT Smart Contract on Remix Remix is an online integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for developing and testing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface and a set of powerful tools for writing, compiling, deploying, and debugging Ethereum smart contracts. In this step, you will learn how to create a new Remix workspace and deploy a smart contract. Don’t worry: The smart contract is already written, so all you need to do is copy and paste. A) Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/ B) Click on the “+” icon in the top left corner of your screen to create a new workspace. C) Enter a name for your new workspace and click “OK”. D) Right-click on “contracts” in the left-hand sidebar and click “New file”. E) Name the file “demo.sol” or any other name you would like and hit enter. F) Copy this code. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n// This is for DEMO purposes only and should not be used in production!\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.10;\r\n\r\n// Importing other

Note: You might get a pop-up warning that you are pasting a large piece of code. Click “OK”. H) Click on the “Solidity Compiler” icon in the left-hand sidebar. I) Click on “Compile demo.sol”. J) Click on the “Deploy \u0026 run transactions” icon in the left sidebar. K) Click on the “Environment” dropdown and change it from “Remix VM (Shanghai)” to “Injected Provider – MetaMask” and follow the prompts in MetaMask to connect your wallet. L) Before deploying the smart contract to the Polygon Mumbai blockchain, we need the subscription ID from the VRF subscription we created in the previous step. Go back to https://vrf.chain.link/mumbai and take note of the ID of the VRF subscription we just created. Your ID will be different from the one in the example. You first have to let the contract know about the subscription. In a future step, you’ll let the subscription know about the contract. M) In Remix, enter the subscription ID in the input box next to the orange “Deploy” button. N) Click “Deploy” and then confirm the transaction in MetaMask. O) If you see a green checkmark in the console at the bottom of your screen, congratulations! You have successfully deployed the contract to the Polygon Mumbai blockchain! Step 5: Add a Consumer to Your VRF Subscription Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed your smart contract. Now, it’s time to add the smart contract as a consumer to the VRF subscription you created in step 3. A) In Remix, copy the address of your contract. B) Go to https://vrf.chain.link/mumbai and connect your wallet by clicking “Connect wallet” in the top right corner. If your wallet is already connected, you can skip this step. C) Click on the ID of the subscription you created in step 3. You can find your subscription under “My Subscriptions”. D) Click on “Add consumer” . E) Paste the contract address in the “Consumer address” input box. This will let the subscription know about the contract you deployed. F) Click “Add consumer” and follow the prompts in MetaMask. G) Click “Close” once the transaction is confirmed and refresh the page. You have successfully completed this step if you see a consumer added to your subscription like in the image below. Step 6: Automate Your NFT With Chainlink Automation In this step, you will create a time-based upkeep using Chainlink Automation to dynamically update the background color and the emoji of your NFT. A) Go to https://automation.chain.link/mumbai and connect your wallet by clicking “Connect wallet” in the top right corner. If your wallet is already connected, you can skip this step. B) Click on “Register new Upkeep”. C) Select “Time-based”. D) Paste in your contract address and click “Next” (refer to step 5A if you need help finding your contract address). E) You are going to receive an alert with the following text: “Couldn’t fetch ABI.” In a separate tab, head back to Remix and select the “Solidity compiler” tab in the left sidebar. F) Make sure your contract is selected in the “Contract” dropdown and click on the “Copy ABI” button. G) Go back to your upkeep registration and paste the ABI in the input box and click “Next”. H) Under “Target function,” select “requestRandomWords” and click “Next”. I) Under “Specify your time schedule,” enter the following CRON expression to generate a new background color for your NFT every 2 minutes: */2 * * * * . J) Click “Next”. K) Give your upkeep a name (e.g. Dynamic NFT Demo) and enter a starting balance of 2 LINK. L) Click on “Register Upkeep” and approve the transaction to deploy the CRON job contract in MetaMask. M) Once the transaction is approved, MetaMask will prompt you to confirm a second transaction to “Request time-based upkeep registration”. N) Wait for the transaction to be confirmed and click on “View Upkeep”. O) You have successfully completed this step if you see “Active” under the status of your newly created upkeep. Congratulations! Step 7: View Your NFT on OpenSea A) Go to https://testnets.opensea.io/ and select “Profile” from the drop-down menu in the top right corner. B) Connect your wallet as shown below. You may have to sign a transaction from OpenSea. C) On your profile, click on the NFT labeled “ETH Watching SVG”. D) Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select “Refresh metadata”. E) Wait 30 seconds and then refresh the page and you should see your newly created dNFT! Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial. Every two minutes, until your subscriptions run out of funds, your NFT will check the price of ETH and request a new background color. The next time you refresh the metadata, you should see something a little different. Conclusion If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You successfully deployed a dynamically updating NFT on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of Ethereum, Chainlink VRF to choose a random background color, and Chainlink Automation to update the image every two minutes.

    "content": "Testnets are designed to mimic the environment of mainnet to enable developers to test and troubleshoot applications without any value being at risk before mainnet deployment. It’s generally considered good practice to test any contract code on a testnet before deploying it on mainnet—most onchain applications have copies deployed to testnets to enable developers to troubleshoot. In this guide, we’ll show you how to get testnet ETH tokens on the Sepolia network to test your Chainlinked smart contract before deploying it on mainnet. What Is the Sepolia Testnet? Sepolia is the recommended default testnet by Ethereum core developers for smart contract application development. Sepolia was initially launched as a proof-of-authority testnet in October 2021 by Ethereum core developers. The network later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to mimic the operating environment of Ethereum mainnet. Sepolia uses a permissioned validator set. Since it’s a relatively new test network with a small state, the network is quick to sync to, and running a node on it requires less storage than on mainnet or other testnets. These features are useful for developers who quickly want to interact with the network directly and run a node. Compared to other Ethereum testnets, such as Goerli, Sepolia’s total supply of testnet ETH tokens is uncapped, making it more likely that developers using Sepolia will continue to be able to access testnet tokens in the future. How To Get Sepolia Testnet ETH Using the Chainlink Testnet Faucet, you can request testnet ETH tokens to test your Chainlinked smart contract on Sepolia. Go to https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia. Make sure you have selected the Ethereum Sepolia network since this is where you want to receive the testnet ETH. Click “Connect wallet” so the faucet app can detect the selected network and your wallet address. If you want to receive testnet funds at a different address than the one you connected, paste the address in the “Wallet address” section. This field defaults to your connected wallet address otherwise. Select whether you’d like to receive Sepolia testnet ETH and/or Sepolia testnet LINK. Verify you’re human by clicking on “Login via GitHub” and connecting your valid GitHub account. This step is necessary to protect against spam requests. Click on “Send request”. The tokens are then transferred from the faucet to the wallet address that you specified. If you’d like to learn more about testing your Chainlinked smart contract, visit the Chainlink Dev Hub.

    "content": "This is Part 1 of a two-part series on the future of trust. Read Part 2, Cryptographic Truth: The Future of Trust-Minimized Computing and Record-Keeping, for a walkthrough of the cryptographic fundamentals that underpin blockchain technology and how Chainlink oracles extend the reach of cryptographic guarantees to the off-chain world. The word “trust” is a heavily debated term in the blockchain industry, where engineers often refer to zero-trust interaction systems, trustless transactions, and other trust-minimized technologies. Though personal interpretations of its meaning in blockchain both vary and overlap, trust will always be at the center of understanding what crypto is really about. Deriving from the Old Norse word traust, meaning “confidence” and also “shelter,” trust has historically referred to the amount of belief one has that people and processes will stay true to their commitments. Trust is foundational to well-functioning societies: high-trust societies generally have increased economic activity and greater social harmony thanks to reduced counterparty risk and fairer dispute resolution. Unfortunately, trust in the institutions responsible for facilitating core social and economic activities is beginning to break down. For instance, Gallup polls indicate that the U.S. population’s confidence in many of the country’s major institutions has been declining over the past 45 years. While the scope of distrust varies across industries and nations, it’s clear from the current negative sentiment toward established systems that people are searching for more equitable solutions. Blockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees—what we often call cryptographic truth—in restoring users’ trust in everyday interactions. Note: We use the word “app” in a broad sense to refer to any interface for interacting with a company, government, or other users on the same platform, whether it be an application you download on your phone or a website. Additionally, when explaining blockchains, we focus on permissionless blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin) given their widespread adoption as opposed to permissioned blockchains. Problem: A Breakdown in Societal Trust The breakdown of trust in traditional institutions and processes is apparent in many aspects of modern societies. Listed below are four problems causing distrust, which directly impact quality of life and economic prosperity. Centralized Ownership of Data and Processes One outcome of the way the Internet was originally architected is that applications (apps) are mostly centralized. A centralized entity typically owns an app’s intellectual property (IP), controls its backend computing, makes key decisions on its future development, and profits from any data and revenue generated. This centralization creates an unequal relationship between users and apps that can easily be abused and fuel distrust. For example, apps can often unilaterally censor the actions of users. Though such actions may be justified as clear violations of terms of service agreements such as the removal of illicit activities, there are many instances where censorship is based on subjective interpretations of vague policies. This puts into question the platform’s credible neutrality—no discrimination for or against any specific people—particularly in situations when the platform’s own financial interests are at stake, external political or social pressure is applied, or users’ personal opinions don’t directly align with the platform’s own. Such forces have resulted in polarizing debates as to whether social media, financial services, content streaming, and various other platforms are justified in censoring or not censoring certain content. “A Pew Research Center survey conducted in June (2020) found that roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults think it is very (37%) or somewhat (36%) likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints that they find objectionable.” Centralization also leads to power structures where small groups of people largely control how platform revenue is distributed and the direction of development while users are left without much say. Though it’s true that owners generally start and manage apps and are to an extent responsible for their success, it’s also true that users often provide immense value to apps as content creators. For instance, users give social media platforms value through the material they generate, which is monetized directly by app developers via advertising. This undoubtedly makes users question whether or not they are getting fair compensation and representation. Users are also becoming more concerned about having to trust apps with their sensitive data. Since users often have to create accounts to interact with apps, the apps are responsible for storing users’ personal information. This centralized storage model opens up a single point of attack for hackers that has resulted in numerous data breaches, as was the case with Equifax, for example. It’s also why apps are able to monetize users’ data without sharing revenue with users. As many have suggested, “if it’s free, then you’re the product” is the basis for most Web2 economic models. Equifax, one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies, leaked the sensitive personal data of 148 million Americans, including names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, and driver’s license numbers. No Shared Sense of Truth A further reason for distrust is the fact that participants in a social or economic relationship don’t always operate with reference to the same source of truth. For instance, there are many business relationships where all participants maintain their own set of records. Not only can an honest mistake from a single participant lead to a lengthy reconciliation process, but it’s possible for parties to intentionally falsify their records in an attempt to delay the agreement, escape their obligations, or present a false sense of success to their counterparties. Look no further than the Wirecard scandal, which saw many financial services companies take losses when the German company Wirecard was found to be engaging in fraudulent accounting practices to cover up €1.9 billion in missing funds from its balance sheet. Similarly, the 2007-2008 financial crisis severely impacted the global financial industry, largely because of a poor shared understanding regarding its systemic overexposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and MBS-linked derivatives. Many people in the UK couldn’t access their cash when Wirecard filed for insolvency, as several prominent Fintech apps relied on Wirecard for payment processing. Underpinning this dynamic is the fact that users don’t always understand the legal relationship they have with an institution. Though the misunderstanding could be interpreted as the fault of users for not reading terms of service agreements, it’s fair to ask whether users should be expected to take time to read and understand long contracts with dense legal jargon that’s purposely vague in order to enable a range of interpretations. When things are going well, misunderstandings may never manifest. However, when unexpected events occur, users often learn that their relationship with an institution is not quite what they thought. Unclear legal relationships are why many traders were blindsided when they learned Robinhood could halt purchases of the GME stock during a period of high trade volume, or why Greek citizens were shocked in 2015 when their banks informed them that they were only allowed to withdraw €60 a day from ATMs. Despite its mission of “democratizing finance for all,” many retail investors were left wondering if Robinhood in fact favored Wall Street hedge funds after the platform paused GameStop trading. The same misunderstanding is often true regarding the relationship users think they have with social media apps, particularly with regard to how their data is collected and shared and how the app’s algorithm determines what they see in their news feeds. Algorithms in particular have fueled distrust because of their opaque nature, with users unable to understand why some material takes preference while other material is not shown at all. This lack of clarity naturally leads to users suggesting political bias or undisclosed influences around the news that’s deemed real and credible and the news that isn’t, further causing a breakdown of trust. Lack of Enforcement and Accountability Disputes are inevitable in certain circumstances, so when they arise it’s critical to resolve them in a manner that’s generally seen as fair. The challenge, however, is that larger institutions often have asymmetrical advantages in dispute resolution processes. This is particularly worrisome in contracts between established institutions and retail users, where the institution knows they have more leeway to renege on their stated commitments given that the user doesn’t have the time, capital, or influence to mount a successful lawsuit. In fact, in some developing countries, the legal system is so unreliable in the face of powerful influences and bribery that certain economic relationships are simply not practical. Mistrust in dispute resolution processes is also subject to a dynamic where an institution becomes so powerful and integrated within a society that it becomes “too big to fail”—a phrase used to describe institutions that governments will bail out after they make poor decisions because their failure presents too much systemic risk. The term was originally derived from the public bailout of large banking and financial services companies that went bankrupt due to overexposure to toxic MBS assets during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It could be argued that a similar dynamic can be seen today in a seeming lack of accountability from governments and central banks, as high inflation and increasing economic inequality takes hold despite their stated goals of controlling inflation and promoting economic stability. Verbal and paper-based promises have been routinely misused by governments and institutions throughout history given weak enforcement mechanisms and lack of accountability. Inefficient Multi-Step Processes Through the addition of trusted third parties and manual verification techniques, the risks of low-trust social and economic relationships can be somewhat offset. However, these processes involve increased costs, longer wait times, and additional trust assumptions. One industry subject to such inefficiencies is international remittances, where a $200 dollar transaction in 2020 incurred on average a 6.5% fee and sometimes took more than 24 hours to settle. Technically, remittances could be near-instant given advancements in digital technology, but not all banks trust each other. Thus, payments have to be routed through several correspondent banks to get to their final destination, incurring fees and extending the settlement time along the way. International remittances can be subject to high fees, long wait times, a lack of transparency, and complex relationship management between banks. Solution: Blockchain and Oracle-Based Trust Networks Instead of counterparties having to trust each other or a third party to follow through on their stated commitments, what if the infrastructure facilitating their interaction could guarantee fair outcomes? And what if that infrastructure had no central administrator or owner? In order to meet these goals, this infrastructure would have to embody two key design principles: minimally extractive coordination and trust-minimized execution. Minimally extractive coordination is when infrastructure facilitates interactions between users with minimal, non-value additive rent-seeking. Unlike a for-profit company, the facilitator here has no financial agenda besides connecting users. For example, a financial marketplace that enables users to buy and sell assets with minimal transaction fees. Trust-minimized execution refers to a process that’s facilitated in a manner where the probability of it operating correctly is so statistically high that it can almost be considered guaranteed. In a sense, the user doesn’t have to trust the infrastructure. Instead, the infrastructure is built to be deterministic, meaning all potential variables that could influence the process are removed or decreased to the point where it’s highly unlikely to not execute exactly as written/coded. Some have even referred to this type of infrastructure as trustless, although one can argue that nothing is truly trustless. Blockchains combine these two properties, serving as minimally extractive coordinators that execute code in a trust-minimized manner. Blockchains provide such properties because they do not have central administrators, but are decentralized computer networks that are financially incentivized to maintain an accurate ledger of who owns specific data and assets on the network. Every time someone creates a new asset, transfers an existing asset to another user, or stores data on the blockchain, a decentralized network of nodes must form a consensus around the validity of each interaction before it’s approved. For instance, if a user wants to send money from one account to another, the blockchain will verify that the user has enough money to fund the transaction before executing it. Decentralized consensus and cryptography are combined in blockchains to form the basis for cryptographic truth—validation of new transactions based on the verification of historical information already stored in the blockchain ledger and deemed true. In this sense, blockchains are deterministic, since approving new transactions doesn’t require new or external information. For a deeper understanding of blockchains, refer to these articles: What is Blockchain Technology? and Blockchains and Oracles: Similarities, Differences, and Synergies. Traditional bank payments have banks serve as trusted custodians in between users while blockchain payments have blockchains act as trust-minimized non-custodial intermediaries. While many recognize blockchains for supporting cryptocurrency-based payment systems, blockchains enable much greater utility through their support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are “if x, then y” programs that run on blockchains in a tamper-proof manner. Developers use one or more smart contracts to create decentralized applications (dApps), with the smart contracts essentially representing the terms and conditions that users must abide by when interacting with the dApp. For a deep dive on smart contracts, check out this article: What Is a Smart Contract? Oracles are critical to creating advanced dApps. Because of the way blockchains are secured, they are inherently disconnected from the outside world—akin to a computer without the Internet. Oracles are supporting infrastructure for blockchains that allow them to interact with external data and systems. In doing so, oracles enable smart contracts to use external data to trigger their execution (e.g. sports match results to settle a wager), send data to external systems for settlement (e.g. payment messages to execute a bank payment), interoperate with smart contracts on other blockchains, and perform computations not possible or practical to do on a blockchain. In this regard, oracles enable hybrid smart contracts—combining on-chain code with off-chain code to form a single application. Chainlink pioneered decentralized oracle networks (DONs) in order to bring trust-minimized properties to oracle services and enable competitive marketplaces that mitigate rent-seeking extraction from oracle providers. The result has been an explosion in new smart contract use cases enabled by Chainlink DONs, such as in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Play-to-Earn gaming (P2E), decentralized insurance, and more. To learn more about oracles and Chainlink, refer to these articles: What is a Blockchain Oracle? and What is Chainlink? A Beginners Guide. Chainlink decentralized oracle networks provide smart contracts on any blockchain with the ability to bidirectionally interact with any external system or resource in a secure, reliable, and accurate manner. The combination of blockchains and oracles provides an end-to-end trust network for coordinating economic and social activities. Blockchains act as tamper-proof backends for codifying, tracking, and enforcing digital contracts while oracles enable smart contracts to accurately verify real-world events, seamlessly interact with legacy systems, and securely interoperate across blockchains. This model shifts applications and digital contracts from probabilistic and human-mediated to deterministic and verified through decentralized consensus. Future: Societal Trust Restored by the Power of Cryptographic Truth By applying blockchain and oracle-powered trust networks to the original problems outlined above, it becomes possible to build a world based on truth, where processes and people stick to their agreements and records are highly reliable. Self-Ownership of Data and Decentralized Ownership of Processes One of the biggest benefits of blockchain technology is the decentralization of the apps/institutions responsible for facilitating social or economic activity. Blockchain technology can create credibly neutral platforms where the ability for platforms to arbitrarily censor users because of financial, political, or social pressures is largely removed. Once the terms and conditions are coded into smart contracts and stored on the blockchain, the relationship between the users and dApps is transparent to all and cannot be overridden by either party or a central administrator. Decentralized system design also removes intermediaries as custodians. Instead, the blockchain is akin to a non-custodial facilitator, where all the data produced by dApps is publicly viewable and immutable, and the users have direct control of their data/assets via private keys that only they possess. For instance, anyone can view the entire transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger and anyone can custody and send their Bitcoin to other users on the network without a bank. Additionally, privacy-preserving oracle solutions are emerging, such as Chainlink’s DECO, which is being built to allow users to prove sensitive information to dApps without revealing it publicly. For example, a user could prove they live in a certain jurisdiction or that their bank balance is above a certain amount without revealing their address or exact balance to the dApp—ultimately removing the responsibility from dApps to store credentials while still making use of them. Chainlink DECO uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable the use of confidential data within smart contracts without revealing the data on-chain. Blockchains and the dApps they support are also democratizing access to their cash flows. The Ethereum blockchain, for example, is moving to a proof-of-stake consensus model where anyone in the world can stake (i.e. lock up in a non-custodial manner) its native ETH cryptocurrency in a specific smart contract in order to become a validator on the network. In becoming a validator, the user can earn a portion of the value generated by the Ethereum blockchain as a reward for validating user transactions. Similar dynamics exist in DeFi applications like Curve, a decentralized exchange designed for low-slippage trades. Within Curve, users can choose to lock the native CRV token in a staking smart contract for up to four years, which provides them with governance rights over the dApp and a proportional percentage of 50% of all trading fee revenue generated by the dApp. Shared Truth Blockchains and dApps are generally open-source technologies where all users have a shared understanding of the code powering the dApp and the data generated from its operations. Essentially, the blockchain is a single, public repository of records that are made equally available to all participants, removing reconciliation disputes and making transparent any systemic risk. Transactions are also verified through a decentralized consensus mechanism as opposed to the opinion of a single user or administrator, meaning the relationship between users and dApps will follow the codified terms. When extended to verifying external connections, oracles often use a decentralized network of nodes and numerous data sources to prevent any single point of failure in verification and execution. For example, Chainlink Price Feeds are DONs that supply real-time asset prices on blockchains to support Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a collection of dApps that provide financial services to users such as lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and more. Chainlink Price Feeds, which currently help secure tens of billions of dollars in value across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), are oracle networks that provide real-time asset prices to dApps via decentralization at the data source, individual node, and oracle network levels. Other oracle solutions for generating shared truth include the Ledger of Record proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, former Coinbase CTO and A16Z General Partner. The Ledger of Record is a concept that uses oracles to cryptographically sign data on blockchains to prove its origin, helping establish a verifiable provenance of information. Not only would it help prevent fake news, deep fakes, and hidden news retractions, but it can be the basis for reputation systems that track the historical credibility of data sources and analysts. Consensus-Based and Cryptographically Enforced Commitments Because blockchains validate transactions on their networks through decentralized consensus, the asymmetrical advantages held by larger counterparties during disputes are generally removed. There is no blockchain administrator to bail dApps out or hit redo after a mistake is made. Instead, blockchains replace human administrators with decentralized networks secured by cryptography and financial incentives to make it extremely difficult to tamper with the consensus mechanism or alter previously stored data. While blockchains and dApps can be built in a manner that enables changes, they generally require social consensus amongst many independent users as opposed to the unilateral decision-making seen in centralized Apps. This is why many dApps are governed through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where users vote on changes. In fact, many dApps have their own native token, which is used by their DAOs to decide on proposals via token-weighted votes. A highly tamper-proof and globally accessible blockchain platform for enforcing digital contracts vastly reduces counterparty risk. Many blockchains and dApps even take it a step further by introducing automatically enforced punishments for bad behavior from participants. For instance, proof-of-stake blockchains can punish validators that act maliciously by confiscating some of their staked tokens as a form of punishment. dApps can also hold users’ capital in escrow and distribute it only after verifying certain events, making it near impossible for the losing side to forgo payment. Decentralized oracle networks offer similar assurances by generating definitive truth—where each dApp defines exactly how they want to derive truth from the external world and what falls outside of those bounds. In this sense, oracles are more flexible in verifying external events for smart contracts, as some users may trust different data sources while others may want to pay for more decentralization of the oracle network. No matter how the users design the oracle mechanism, they must all agree that it’s sufficient to service their needs. The agreement between the users and oracles can then be made into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) smart contract to avoid tampering and automatically enforce rewards/penalties upon completion. One example of an oracle service that provides definitive truth is Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF uses oracle technology to generate random numbers and cryptographic proofs off-chain. It then publishes them on-chain, where the blockchain uses the cryptographic proof to verify that the random number was not tampered with by the oracles. NFT and gaming applications use the randomness provided by Chainlink VRF to perform various on-chain functions, such as picking winners of special NFT drops and determining the content of loot boxes. Importantly, users are able to independently verify that the process is fair and unbiased, with even the game developers/NFT creators not able to influence the randomized outcome. Polychain Monsters is a blockchain gaming project that uses Chainlink VRF to mint provably random NFTs from a pool of various traits of varying rarity. Efficient Peer-to-Peer Processes Not only do blockchains provide higher security, reliability, and accuracy guarantees for their computations, but they operate in a peer-to-peer manner. By removing intermediaries, rent-seeking and settlement times can be reduced. This is most evident in Ethereum layer-2 scalability solutions—networks built on top of Ethereum that are optimized for lower costs and higher throughput while still deriving their security from the baselayer Ethereum blockchain. With layer-2 solutions, users can make peer-to-peer payments of any amount to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes and for less than a standard international wire fee. This peer-to-peer quality is also evident in new parametric insurance dApps such as those created by Arbol and Etherisc, which enable anyone to purchase weather and flight insurance, with the only requirement being an Internet connection. The smart contract settles the policy once an oracle network confirms the outcome of the specific insurable event, e.g. crop insurance settled by the amount of seasonal rainfall in a particular region or flight insurance determined by whether or not flights are canceled. Once the oracle report is delivered, the smart contract can instantly release compensation from escrow without needing any human approvals. Parametric crop insurance smart contracts can settle efficiently without human intermediaries.

    "summary": "In this developer tutorial, learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract in an EVM environment using Solidity.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are computer programs published and executed in a blockchain environment. As they run on blockchains, they can be run without a central party or server. They are commonly written in the Solidity language. On the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts can interact with existing deployed contracts. This also applies to any other EVM-compatible blockchain (any blockchain that was created using the Ethereum virtual machine). Here are some example of smart contracts that interact with other smart contracts: Token minters or issuers have permission to call a token’s smart contract and issue it. Decentralized exchanges interact with other smart contracts all the time, in the form of traded tokens. When you get a quote for an asset using Chainlink Data Feed, your smart contract is interacting with the asset’s price aggregator, which is another smart contract. When you use Chainlink VRF, the verifiable random number generator, your contract sends a request to the VRF Coordinator, which will send the numbers back to your smart contract. To automate the execution of a smart contract using Chailink Keepers, you create a Keepers Upkeep, which will check conditions and execute instructions on the deployed smart contract. Why Call a Function From Another Smart Contract? Sometimes an application needs to be split into several smart contracts. For example, I once created an application that was already separated into three smart contracts that interacted with each other, but I couldn’t publish it on Ethereum mainnet because the size in bytes exceeded the allowed limit. I had to refactor the application to split it into five smart contracts in order for the app to be published. Another interesting use case is upgradeable contracts. Blockchains are immutable, which means it’s not possible to change the code of a smart contract once it has been deployed. But it is possible to create a proxy delegating function calls to another contract that contains the actual business logic. If you would like to change the logic, you can provide a different target address to the proxy contract, for example a new deployed version with some improvements. It is possible to separate logic and data into different smart contracts. The logic contract could be updated or swapped out via proxy while retaining all information in the data contract. This feature is very powerful as it allows code to be reused and some deployed contracts to be used like libraries. It can also reduce deployment costs because the contract which uses the library doesn’t need to include all the code itself. Calling Another Smart Contract With Solidity Let’s use Remix, an online web tool. Go to remix.ethereum.org to get started. Create a File For Your Smart Contracts Create a file to add smart contracts to. Yes, it is possible to have more than one smart contract in the same file! In Remix, click on the second icon on the left bar, “File Explorers”. Click on the button “Create a new file”. Name your file Contracts.sol You’ll write and deploy two smart contracts in Solidity inside this file. First of all, define the SPDX license type and compiler version. Copy and paste this part: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity 0.8.16;\r\n Counter Contract The first contract is the “Counter,” a script to increment a number. Copy and paste this example: contract Counter {\r\n\r\n    uint public number;\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    function increment() external {\r\n\r\n        number +\u003d 1;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n} This Counter contract has: A public variable number, of unsigned integer type, which will store the value of increment. A function increment to increase the value of the number variable by one. It is an external function, which means it can be called from other contracts and via transactions. Compile the Counter contract Locate in the left bar a button called “Solidity compiler”. Click on the button “Compile Contracts.sol”. Enable the auto-compile option. Check the green sign at the button with the message compilation successful. Deploy the Counter contract In the left side panel, go to the button “Deploy and run transactions”. For now, we have only one smart contract, so “Counter” is automatically selected in the dropdown “Contracts”. Click on the button “Deploy”. Locate the contract at the bottom of the left panel and copy its address. For example, mine is: 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138 You should see something like the image below: Find the contract in the bottom left of screen. Interacting With the Counter Expand the Counter contract and: Click on the “number” button and check that it is 0. Click on the “increment “button to send a transaction to increase the number. Click on the “number” button again and check that now it is 1. This is the final result: The final result of the contract counter. CounterCaller Contract Now that we have our first contract deployed, let’s create another contract which will use the Counter increment function. This is a mechanism like dependency injection. The caller can instantiate the contract it wants to call and knows the type signature of the functions and public variables. Copy and paste this code at the end of the Contracts.sol file: contract CounterCaller {\r\n\r\n    Counter public myCounter;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    constructor(address counterAddress) {\r\n\r\n        myCounter \u003d Counter(counterAddress);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    function counterIncrement() external {\r\n\r\n        myCounter.increment();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n} The CounterCaller contract has: A public variable called myCounter, of type Counter. It means that we are using the contract we want to call as a type, getting the specification for the public functions and variables of the Counter Contract. The constructor, a function that is called only during the deploy process and used to initialize myCounter with the address of the Counter deployed previously. The function counterIncrement which will call the function increment on myCounter, which is like a “pointer” to the smart contract Counter. Check it out the whole file Contracts.sol: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity 0.8.16;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract Counter {\r\n\r\n    uint public number;\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    function increment() external {\r\n\r\n        number +\u003d 1;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract CounterCaller {\r\n\r\n    Counter public myCounter;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    constructor(address counterAddress) {\r\n\r\n        myCounter \u003d Counter(counterAddress);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    function counterIncrement() external {\r\n\r\n        myCounter.increment();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n} Compile the CounterCaller contract If you already enabled the auto-compile option, it is compiled. Check the green sign at the button with the message compilation successful. Otherwise, follow the instructions to compile the Counter Contract, explained before. Now, let’s deploy the CounterCaller contract. In the left side panel, go to the button “Deploy and run transactions”. In the dropdown Contract, select CounterCaller. Paste the Counter address in the field at the right side of the button Deploy. Click on the button “Deploy”. Deploying the ContractCaller contract. Interacting With the CounterCaller Locate the CounterCaller contract at the bottom of the left panel and expand it. Click on “myCounter” button and check that it is the Counter address. Click on the “counterIncrement” button to send a transaction calling the function increment on the Counter contract. Go to the Counter contract and click on the number button to verify that it increased again, now it should be 2. This is the final result: Interact with the CounterCaller contract. This is a basic example to help you learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract using Solidity. There are other ways to delegate calls between contracts in Solidity. It is important to notice that a deployed contract always has an address and if you know the functions and public variables, another smart contract can call it. Now that you know how to call a smart contract from another smart contract, a whole host of use cases and abilities are open to you. You can: Split a contract into multiple contracts Design the architecture of complex dApps Enable reusability Create a factory contract (a smart contract which can create others contracts) If you’re a developer and want to secure your smart contracts, dApp, or protocol, consider using Chainlink in your smart contract applications.

    "content": "Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains. With cryptocurrency and blockchain technology gaining mainstream attention and Chainlink establishing itself as a key component of many blockchain applications, more people are entering the industry and asking the fundamental question: what is Chainlink? In order to help those new to blockchains, smart contracts, and oracles, we’ve created a simple overview to showcase the value of the Chainlink oracle network and how it enables blockchain technology to reach its full potential. This guide provides context on Chainlink by answering three key questions: What is the underlying value proposition of blockchains and smart contracts? Why is there an inherent limitation to smart contracts that Chainlink must help resolve? How does Chainlink’s solution unlock the full potential of smart contracts? How Blockchains Eliminate Counterparty Risk To fully comprehend the importance of Chainlink, it’s critical to first understand the underlying value of blockchains and smart contracts. Generally, a blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that performs computation and stores data in a shared ledger. A blockchain differs from traditional, centralized computer systems in that: No single person or group controls it. Everyone in the world has equal access to send it commands. The applications running on it and the data stored in it cannot be tampered with or deleted. All transactions processed over time are recorded in a continuously growing ledger. Transactions are paid for via a native cryptocurrency. Blockchains achieve these properties by having thousands of computers run the same software, process the same transactions, store the same data, and consistently cross-check one another to reach consensus as a network about what is valid. All these network operations are backed by monetary incentives that reinforce honest behavior and consensus. By redundantly validating and storing transactions across a large decentralized network of financially incentivized participants, blockchains make it extremely expensive and impractical to manipulate the shared ledger. Thus, blockchains are extremely secure and reliable systems for performing computation and storing data for processes involving two or more independent parties. The fundamental benefit of blockchains is that they mitigate counterparty risk—the risk that the other party in a contract won’t uphold their end of the agreement. For example, if someone wants to make a digital trade with a stranger, how do they decide who sends money first, whether they have enough funds, and that the funds can’t be spent twice (commonly known as the double spending problem)? Traditionally, users would employ a third party such as a payment processor or clearinghouse to facilitate the trade or arbitrate a dispute. However, a blockchain serves as a more reliable, tamperproof, and unbiased system for settling transactions. Users know that when they send a transaction to the blockchain, it will execute exactly as instructed. As opposed to a bank, a blockchain transfers money between parties without taking custody. A blockchain’s decentralized architecture is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged as such strong forms of money: users can trust that no central administrator will inflate the supply (capped at 21M BTC) and that the underlying Bitcoin blockchain showing who owns Bitcoin has been validated by thousands of computers across the world. Also, the decentralized design of the blockchain allows users to exchange value directly, “peer-to-peer”, removing custodial middlemen who can siphon off fees and censor transactions, ultimately allowing users to retain ownership over their assets and data. However, blockchains can support many use cases beyond simply moving and recording money on a ledger. Some highly programmable blockchains allow a more expressive set of commands, specifically through running applications on the network that trigger actions based on specific, predefined events (if x event happens, then execute y action). For example, if Flight 777 is canceled tomorrow, issue an insurance payout of $77; if not, then don’t make the payment. These blockchain applications, which can process a wider range of logic, are referred to as “smart contracts,” and have been the subject of much of the development around blockchains since Ethereum first introduced them at scale in 2015. Problem: Smart Contracts Can Reintroduce Counterparty Risk The problem is that a smart contract requires data (e.g. flight departure information) to execute commands, but most of the data it needs to digitize and automate real-world agreements is not stored on blockchains. The smart contract cannot fetch external data either, because blockchains are like black boxes with no built-in ability to connect with the outside world. This means that asset prices, sports scores, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, web data, enterprise systems, and the multitude of other real-world datasets are simply not available on the blockchain, severely limiting the types of smart contracts developers can create. How does one develop a flight insurance agreement without flight data? The only way to efficiently get data into the blockchain is for a software component called an “oracle” to input it into the blockchain. The challenge then becomes, how to design an oracle mechanism with the same security and reliability properties of the underlying blockchain so as to retain the underlying value proposition of the smart contract, e.g. extreme reliability without counterparty risk. If a single, centralized oracle is responsible for inputting the data used to trigger the smart contract, then that oracle has complete control over the smart contract’s outcome. This introduces a serious point of failure known as the oracle problem, which puts the entire smart contract at risk. A centralized oracle introduces a single point of failure in the delivery of data to the blockchain. Solution: The Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, was developed to allow smart contracts to automate the transfer of data between blockchains and outside systems in a highly secure and reliable manner. It uses a similar model to a blockchain in that there is a decentralized network of independent entities (oracles) that collectively retrieve data from multiple sources, aggregate it, and deliver a validated, single data point to the smart contract to trigger its execution, removing any centralized point of failure. For example, Chainlink provides the USD price of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ETH to blockchains via the ETH/USD Price Feed, which uses numerous independent oracle nodes and data sources to source and deliver the price data (pictured below). The ETH/USD price oracle can then be used by a blockchain application to get the current price of ETH when being used as collateral to obtain a loan or to settle a prediction made about the future ETH price. The ETH/USD Chainlink Price Feed aggregates price data from numerous independent oracle node operators. Chainlink also provides multiple layers of security that go beyond decentralization to ensure users can trust the oracle network: Generalized architecture – Chainlink is a flexible framework for building and running oracle networks, meaning users can construct and/or connect to customized oracle networks without dependencies on other oracle networks. The basic distinction between the Chainlink Network, oracle network, Chainlink node, and node operator. Data signing – Chainlink oracles sign the data they input on-chain with a unique cryptographic signature, allowing users to prove its origin as being from a specific oracle node. High-quality data – Chainlink provides smart contracts with data from any external system including premium data providers and allows smart contracts to send commands to other systems such as to make a payment on a traditional payment rail. Blockchain agnostic – Chainlink can run natively on any blockchain without dependencies on other blockchains, meaning it can support public blockchains, enterprise blockchains, and more. Chainlink connects smart contracts on any blockchain to any input and output. Service-level agreements – Chainlink will eventually allow users to define the terms of the oracle job requested in on-chain smart contracts, which may require that oracle nodes put down a security deposit that is only returned to the node if they perform according to pre-agreed upon terms (e.g. data is delivered on time). Reputation systems – Chainlink oracles’ historical performance is publicly available via signed data on-chain, allowing users to select oracles based on historical performance metrics such as average response time, completion ratio, average security deposit, and more. Node operators also have the option of providing additional data like their identity, geographic location, and third-party certifications. Optional features – Chainlink is also developing additional security approaches for features like oracle and data privacy, advanced oracle computations, and more. Use Cases of Chainlink By providing strong security and reliability guarantees on par with the blockchain, more advanced smart contracts are being created using Chainlink oracles. While we have already outlined 77 Smart Contract Use Cases Enabled By Chainlink, some of the main ones include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Many traditional financial products like loans, payments, derivatives, asset equity, and more are being built on the blockchain using smart contracts to increase their security and transparency and reduce barriers to entry. These DeFi applications use Chainlink to price assets, access interest rates, verify collateralization, and more, which enable these products to perform functions like issue a loan at fair market value, automate the issuance of dividends, and settle an options contract. Insurance Smart contracts are also being leveraged to create parametric insurance contracts on the blockchain. Chainlink is currently being used in production to provide weather data to the Arbol crop insurance market, enabling farmers all over the world to obtain parametric crop insurance simply with an Internet connection, which is settled in a fair and timely manner according to the amount of rainfall, temperature, or other evaluators the policy is set to (e.g. if it rains more than x amount this year, pay out y settlement). Gaming Developers are also beginning to launch smart contract-based gaming applications on the blockchain that often incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) as scarce digital collectibles. One of the key building blocks of many blockchain games is a source of randomness to generate random in-game scenarios or determine the lucky winner of prizes. Chainlink provides a randomness solution called VRF, which generates randomness and delivers it to the smart contract in a manner where users can prove it is fair and unbiased, as neither the players, game creators, or external entities can tamper with or manipulate the randomness to their advantage. Chainlink VRF enables input and output randomness for in-game scenarios for blockchain games. Traditional Systems Another key use case of Chainlink is providing traditional systems like data providers, IoT networks, websites, and enterprises a way to make their data and services available to any blockchain network. Since the Chainlink Network is blockchain-agnostic, Chainlink oracles serve as an integration gateway for connecting current digital and data infrastructure to any/all blockchain networks. An industry-standard interoperability framework using oracle networks like Chainlink to connect traditional systems with blockchains was outlined in the recent World Economic Forum report co-authored by Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov titled Bridging the Governance Gap: Interoperability for Blockchain and Legacy Systems. These are just some of the many capabilities Chainlink provides to allow smart contracts to interact with external data and systems with a high degree of security and reliability. The end result is the ability for blockchain-based smart contract applications to enable extensively more use cases across a more diverse set of markets. If blockchains are decentralized computers and smart contracts are decentralized applications, then Chainlink can be thought of like a decentralized Internet that finally allows smart contracts to interact with the outside world while maintaining blockchain technology’s fundamental guarantees around security, transparency, and trust.

    "content": "The future is on. The replatforming of capital markets into on-chain finance is projected to disrupt more than $867 trillion in global asset value. Powering this transformation is the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a breakthrough in blockchain connectivity and interoperability that enables DeFi applications to access users and interface with other DeFi applications across different blockchains, all from a single interface. CCIP also gives existing financial systems a seamless connection to public and private blockchains—making it easy for them to transition existing assets and financial services on-chain. If successful, we could see trillions of dollars in new assets flow into blockchain ecosystems. Catalyzing the Next DeFi Revolution Over the past few years, the cross-chain ecosystem has experienced growing pains, as previous cross-chain solutions have suffered a number of exploits due to poor design choices, large attack surfaces, and complex user experiences. Over $2.6B has been exploited due to cross-chain bridge hacks thus far. What the market needs is a cross-chain solution with a higher standard of security, reliability, and usability. 64% of funds stolen in DeFi hacks in 2022 were from cross-chain bridge hacks, according to Chainalysis. 1/ The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has officially launched on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon mainnets.#LinkTheWorld pic.twitter.com/SdLVyaapg3 — Chainlink (@chainlink) July 17, 2023 Pioneered by a world-class research team, CCIP raises the bar in cross-chain security by introducing new features, such as rate limits on token transfers as a way to minimize potential damage and the Risk Management Network—an independent network that verifies cross-chain operations for erroneous activity. CCIP also establishes new standards in cross-chain reliability and usability by introducing features such as Smart Execution—a gas-locked fee payment mechanism where users only need to pay on the source chain and CCIP will take care of execution on the destination chain. Underpinning these new features is the same Chainlink foundation of decentralized oracle networks that have already helped secure tens of billions of dollars for DeFi protocols and enabled over $8 trillion in on-chain transaction value. CCIP is now running live on Mainnet for Early Access participants, which include two leading DeFi protocols: Synthetix—CCIP enables synth tokens to flow seamlessly across chains to wherever there is the greatest immediate demand, deepening liquidity and increasing capital efficiency. Aave—CCIP is being integrated to power Aave’s multi-chain governance system, saving significant time and developer resources and increasing protocol security. “Security is critical when dealing with on-chain assets, which is why we leverage Chainlink CCIP for our cross-chain Synths Teleporter.”—Kain Warwick, Founder, Synthetix The On-Chain Gateway for the World’s Biggest Banks Illiquid assets can grow from 16x to 17x from today’s levels (BCG, 2022). Hundreds of trillions of dollars flow across global financial markets. Universal and frictionless connectivity across financial markets is a massive value-add for all participants, which is why widely adopted financial market infrastructure providers such as DTCC, Euroclear, and Swift exist. While 97% of institutional investors agree that “tokenization will revolutionize asset management,” there have been two long-standing roadblocks to moving hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets on-chain: Blockchain connectivity (legacy-to-blockchain): The ability to connect the core business infrastructure of existing financial systems to any blockchain. Cross-chain interoperability (blockchain-to-blockchain): A highly secure communication standard that can connect any public or private chain to one another. CCIP overcomes these challenges. In a recently announced collaboration with Swift, Chainlink CCIP is helping enable end-to-end communication between legacy systems and blockchain networks, as well as interoperability across both public and private blockchains. Over a dozen major global financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers are participating in the collaboration, including DTCC, BNY Mellon, Citi, and Euroclear. “[This collaboration] will also highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.”—Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Securities Strategy at Swift Creating the Unified Internet of Contracts Chainlink CCIP connects private and public blockchain networks to create a unified Internet of contracts. Today, the world’s contractual value is fragmented across both the existing financial system and the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem. The fragmentation of blockchain networks is similar to the early days of the Internet, where there were separate intranets, LANs, and consortiums of terminals that couldn’t interact with one another. The early interoperability standards completely transformed the Internet. TCP/IP, HTTP, and email protocols enabled seamless connectivity between users, who then saw their web applications increase in value exponentially as more people joined the network. It shouldn’t matter what blockchain you launch a dApp or token on or what type of backend system you want to interact from—as long as that environment is connected to an interoperability standard, it can access any chain and its supported dApps. Now, CCIP provides a connectivity standard that enables traditional finance to easily interact with smart contracts, as well as securely transact across different public and private blockchains. Connectivity both to and across multiple blockchains is critical for creating a unified financial system where tokens and messages can seamlessly flow across different environments. Similar to TCP/IP’s foundational role in Internet communication, Chainlink CCIP is the foundation for an interoperable blockchain ecosystem. The key difference between TCP/IP and CCIP is that while TCP/IP enables information to flow freely across the Internet, CCIP enables value to be transferred across networks securely. The launch of CCIP marks a key moment in the evolution of the Internet and moves society one step closer to a world underpinned by interoperable smart contracts: The Internet of Contracts. “Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.”—Chainlink Co-Founder, Sergey Nazarov Bringing It All Together: The On-Chain Economy Powered by Chainlink Potential value to be secured by Chainlink CCIP. Becoming the industry standard across both bank chains and public blockchains positions CCIP to become the universal connectivity layer bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. We envision a future where Web3 and the global financial system are largely one and the same, with vast amounts of value flowing across these systems and chains via CCIP. By connecting these two worlds, the extensive liquidity and technological infrastructure already present in the global financial system can take advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and connectivity advantages now available through blockchains. Given the massive size of the global banking system, if even a small fraction of assets move on-chain and connect to the Internet of Contracts, the Web3 ecosystem could grow exponentially.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Discover how to use Chainlink CCIP to create cross-chain applications, enabling a less fragmented Web3.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a new generalized cross-chain communication protocol that provides smart contract developers with the ability to transfer data and tokens across blockchain networks in a trust-minimized manner. Currently, applications deployed across multiple blockchains suffer from the fragmentation of assets, liquidity, and users. With CCIP, developers can utilize token transfers and arbitrary messaging to enable the creation of decentralized applications that are composed of multiple different smart contracts deployed across multiple different blockchain networks that interoperate to create a single unified application. This Web3 design pattern is known as the cross-chain smart contract. Below are a few examples of CCIP use cases for cross-chain applications, ranging from DeFi and cross-chain ENS to minting NFTs on multiple chains to cross-chain gaming. These use case examples demonstrate the potential for CCIP to transform traditional single-chain or multi-chain applications into powerful new cross-chain dApps. All examples can be found on the Chainlink Labs GitHub and can be deployed and interacted with now. DeFi: Cross-Chain Composability DeFi is a category of Web3 applications that is ripe for transformation by cross-chain smart contracts. In the world of DeFi today, many applications are either deployed on a single chain or on multiple chains, with each instance requiring its own set of users and liquidity. Within each chain, there is a concept of DeFi composability and “money Legos,” with developers able to permissionless-ly connect and integrate with various protocols deployed on a particular network to create new use cases and financial products. By enabling cross-chain smart contracts and cross-chain token transfers, CCIP takes the concept of DeFi composability and exponentially multiplies it. Because now, instead of composability being restricted to each chain and limited to the DeFi protocols on that chain, all DeFi applications on all blockchains can now be composed together in various ways to create new financial products. Applications and protocols are no longer confined to the chain they’re on. This cross-chain composability of DeFi applications enables a less fragmented and more connected DeFi ecosystem, with liquidity, users, and financial products on all chains being available to all protocols. Using the money Legos analogy, CCIP enables you to bring all of your different Lego sets together and build financial protocols with them as if they were a single, unified set. One particular DeFi financial service that would greatly benefit from CCIP is lending and borrowing. In today’s world, most DeFi lending and borrowing protocols require you to deposit collateral on the chain the protocol you want to use is deployed on. But many DeFi users use multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains and have assets scattered across all these chains. These users often chase the best returns, adjusting their positions to maximize yield, but in many cases they have assets locked up in protocols on one chain when there are better yield-earning opportunities to use those assets on another chain. If they wanted to participate in those superior yield opportunities, they’d need to liquidate their position on one chain, manually bridge the asset to the new chain, deposit that asset on to the protocol on the new chain, and then perform the same process in reverse when they want to return their asset to the originating chain—a lot of steps just to move assets into a new protocol to chase yield opportunities. Scenarios like this are where CCIP can help enable DeFi protocols to truly go cross-chain, and allow users to seamlessly utilize digital assets on one chain as collateral for a DeFi protocol on another chain, all handled by CCIP at the protocol level, without the user having to perform manual steps, or adding trust assumptions due to using a third party bridge. Using CCIP, a DeFi protocol can enable a borrower to deposit assets on one (source) chain, or transfer them directly to a destination chain, and then have those assets made available on the destination chain to borrow against. Then when they wish to stop using their assets on the destination chain, the DeFi protocol can use CCIP to withdraw their position and move their assets back to the originating chain. This is the power of CCIP-enabled DeFi. In this example, we have a DeFi smart contract Sender.sol on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. This contract accepts user deposits in the form of a token; it could be wrapped ETH, a stablecoin, or any token that has a real value. Sender.sol has a sendMessage function, which uses CCIP to execute a programmable token transfer of the specified tokens as well as a message to a destination chain. In this case, we are sending the specified tokens to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, with the message containing the end-user’s EOA (externally owned account): // Sender.sol\r\n Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory evm2AnyMessage \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\nreceiver: abi.encode(receiver), // ABI-encoded receiver contract address\r\ndata: data,\r\ntokenAmounts: tokenAmounts,\r\nextraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\nClient.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 200_000, strict: false}) // Additional arguments, setting gas limit and non-strict sequency mode\r\n),\r\nfeeToken: address(linkToken) // Setting feeToken to LinkToken address, indicating LINK will be used for fees\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n// Initialize a router client instance to interact with cross-chain router\r\nIRouterClient router \u003d IRouterClient(this.getRouter());\r\n\r\n\r\n// Get the fee required to send the message. Fee paid in LINK.\r\nuint256 fees \u003d router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Approve the Router to pay fees in LINK tokens on contract\u0027s behalf.\r\nlinkToken.approve(address(router), fees);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Approve the Router to transfer the tokens on contract\u0027s behalf.\r\nIERC20(tokenToTransfer).approve(address(router), transferAmount);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Send the message through the router and store the returned message ID\r\nmessageId \u003d router.ccipSend(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Emit an event with message details\r\nemit MessageSent(messageId, destinationChainSelector, receiver, msg.sender, tokenAmount, fees);\r\n Note: All code examples in this post are illustrative and are provided on an “as-is” basis without any representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions of any kind. Use of these code snippets is governed by our Terms of Service found at chain.link/terms. On the Ethereum Sepolia network, we have deployed a Protocol.sol smart contract. This contract receives the CCIP programmable token transfer message and does the following: Mints and controls stablecoins that can be borrowed against deposited collateral. From the CCIP message, reads the specified token contract address (on the destination chain) for which funds were sent from the source chain (as collateral for borrowing) and the amount deposited. Also from the CCIP message contents, reads the end-user’s (depositor/borrower’s) wallet address. The stablecoin is minted to this address, and this address is also used to track deposits and borrowing. Stores this information in the smart contract. // Protocol.sol\r\n   bytes32 messageId \u003d any2EvmMessage.messageId; // fetch the messageId\r\n   uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector; // fetch the source chain identifier (aka selector)\r\n   address sender \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)); // abi-decoding of the sender address\r\n\r\n   // Collect tokens transferred. This increases this contract\u0027s balance for that Token.\r\n   Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokenAmounts \u003d any2EvmMessage.destTokenAmounts;\r\n   address token \u003d tokenAmounts[0].token;\r\n   uint256 amount \u003d tokenAmounts[0].amount;\r\n\r\n   address depositor \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (address)); // abi-decoding of the depositor\u0027s address\r\n\r\n   receivedMessages.push(messageId);\r\n   MessageIn memory detail \u003d MessageIn(sourceChainSelector, sender, depositor, token, amount);\r\n   messageDetail[messageId] \u003d detail;\r\n\r\n   emit MessageReceived(messageId, sourceChainSelector, sender, depositor, tokenAmounts[0]);\r\n\r\n   // Store depositor data.\r\n   deposits[depositor][token] \u003d amount;\r\n Once this CCIP programmable token transfer message has been received and successfully processed by Protocol.sol, the user can then manually initiate an action to borrow funds by executing the borrowUSDC function. This function allows the user to use the transferred tokens as collateral to mint and borrow an equivalent amount of a stablecoin, such as USDC, to the borrower’s EOA. In this example, we assume a 70% collateralization ratio, meaning that the protocol will lend no more than 70% of the value of the deposited token: uint256 borrowed \u003d borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)];\r\nrequire(borrowed \u003d\u003d 0, \"Caller has already borrowed USDC\");\r\n\r\naddress transferredToken \u003d messageDetail[msgId].token;\r\nrequire(transferredToken !\u003d address(0), \"Caller has not transferred this token\");\r\n\r\nuint256 deposited \u003d deposits[msg.sender][transferredToken];\r\nuint256 borrowable \u003d (deposited * 70) / 100; // 70% collateralization ratio.\r\n\r\n// LINK/USD on Sepolia (https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xc59E3633BAAC79493d908e63626716e204A45EdF)\r\n// Docs: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses#Sepolia%20Testnet\r\nAggregatorV3Interface priceFeed \u003d AggregatorV3Interface(0xc59E3633BAAC79493d908e63626716e204A45EdF);\r\n\r\n(, int256 price, , , ) \u003d priceFeed.latestRoundData(); \r\nuint256 price18decimals \u003d uint256(price * (10 ** 10)); // make USD price 18 decimal places from 8\r\n\r\n\r\nuint256 borrowableInUSDC \u003d borrowable * price18decimals;\r\n\r\n// MintUSDC\r\nusdcToken.mint(msg.sender, borrowableInUSDC);\r\n\r\n// Update state.\r\nborrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)] \u003d borrowableInUSDC;\r\n\r\n\r\nreturn borrowableInUSDC;\r\n Once the user has successfully borrowed UDSC on Sepolia against their deposited collateral, they can then use the funds as they wish on any DeFi protocol on the Sepolia network. Then, when they are done, they can repay the funds to Protocol.sol, which will cause the stablecoin tokens to be burnt, and a CCIP programmable token transfer message is then sent back to the Sender.sol contract on the Fuji network, which will return the locked up tokens to the specified address on the Fuji network. Note that the user must first approve Protocol.sol as a “spender” of the user’s borrowed stablecoin for the protocol to be able to burn the borrowed amount, which is how repayment is implemented: require(amount \u003e\u003d borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)], \"Repayment amount is less than amount borrowed\");\r\n\r\n\r\n// Get the deposit details, so it can be transferred back.\r\naddress transferredToken \u003d messageDetail[msgId].token;\r\nuint256 deposited \u003d deposits[msg.sender][transferredToken];\r\n\r\n\r\nuint256 mockUSDCBal \u003d usdcToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);\r\nrequire(mockUSDCBal \u003e\u003d amount, \"Caller\u0027s USDC token balance insufficient for repayment\");\r\n\r\n\r\nif (usdcToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) \u003c borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)]) {\r\nrevert(\"Protocol allowance is less than amount borrowed\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nusdcToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, mockUSDCBal);\r\n\r\n\r\nborrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)] \u003d 0;\r\n// send transferred token and message back to Sepolia Sender contract\r\nsendMessage(destinationChain, receiver, transferredToken, deposited); The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP-DeFi Lending GitHub repository. DeFi: Cross-Chain Liquidation Protection Continuing with the theme of DeFi and lending and borrowing protocols, many DeFi users have multiple positions held across multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains. This makes keeping track of portfolios and DeFi positions difficult. There are multiple third-party platforms, trackers, and even yield aggregators available, with DeFi users able to simply deploy collateral and let these third-party platforms handle the deploying and moving around of assets to optimize yield for the end-user. While these tools are a great way to abstract away some of the complexities of DeFi so users can simply earn yield, they are not trust-minimized. The user is entrusting the protocol to earn yield and to ensure positions are kept collateralized to avoid liquidation. In addition to this, if the end-user wants to have some sort of liquidation protection, they are required to have native assets deployed across all blockchains they have DeFi positions in, ready to be deployed to ensure collateralization of loans on the positions they have on each respective chain. With CCIP and cross-chain token transfers and messaging, DeFi protocols, position monitoring apps, and yield aggregators can be enhanced to have cross-chain liquidation protection. This means that a user can have open positions on multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains, and they can then allocate assets on a single chain to be used as extra collateral in the event that one or more of the loans requires extra funds to ensure collateralization. Here’s how that works at a high level: A DeFi end-user has debt positions across multiple protocols across multiple chains (e.g., Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon), but they keep their liquidity safely in a vault on one chain (e.g., Aave on Ethereum). On each chain where the user has a debt position, a user’s implementation of Chainlink Automation monitors the debt ratio of the positions. If Automation detects that any of their loans are approaching the liquidation threshold, then Automation will send a CCIP message to the user’s liquidity chain (e.g., Ethereum) to request funds to be sent to top up the debt position. When the contract on the liquidity chain receives the CCIP message, it withdraws liquidity from Aave and sends a new CCIP message back to the requesting chain with the funds. The message includes enough information and tokens to fund the position and avoid a liquidation scenario. The result of this is the user can have debt positions on multiple chains while still keeping liquidity on a single chain. The entire process is trust-minimized, with the user still 100% in control of their debt positions, and they do not have to manually withdraw and move funds across chains. Here’s how it works: Chainlink Automation monitors all chains where a user has a debit position and determines if a message for funding needs to be sent. If required, the performUpkeep function will then send a CCIP message to the vault on the chain that has liquidity, requesting funds to be sent. function checkUpkeep(\r\n       bytes calldata checkData\r\n   )\r\n       external\r\n       view\r\n       override\r\n       returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)\r\n   {\r\n       upkeepNeeded \u003d\r\n           IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).healthFactor(i_onBehalfOf) \u003c\r\n           i_minHealthFactor \u0026\u0026\r\n           !_isCcipMessageSent;\r\n   }\r\n\r\nfunction performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {\r\n       require(\r\n           !_isCcipMessageSent,\r\n           \"CCIP Message already sent, waiting for a response\"\r\n       );\r\n       require(\r\n           IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).healthFactor(i_onBehalfOf) \u003c\r\n               i_minHealthFactor,\r\n           \"Account can\u0027t be liquidated!\"\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       // Ask for funds from LPSC on the source blockchain\r\n       Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n           receiver: abi.encode(i_lpsc),\r\n           data: abi.encode(\r\n               i_tokenAddress,\r\n               IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).getBorrowedAmount(i_onBehalfOf)\r\n           ),\r\n           tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n           extraArgs: \"\",\r\n           feeToken: i_link\r\n       });\r\n\r\n       bytes32 messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_sourceChainRouter).ccipSend(\r\n           i_sourceChainSelector,\r\n           message\r\n       );\r\n       _isCcipMessageSent \u003d true;\r\n\r\n       emit MessageSent(messageId);\r\n   }\r\n The vault on the chain that has the liquidity then receives the request for funds and checks if it has enough funds to send back to the requesting chain or if it should withdraw some liquidity from a DeFi protocol (such as Aave) to ensure it has enough funds to send. Following this, it then initiates a CCIP programmable token transfer containing the funds requested as well as the message ID of the initially received message (so the destination contract on the blockchain that requested funds knows which request the funds are for): function _ccipReceive(\r\n       Client.Any2EVMMessage memory receivedMessage\r\n   ) internal override {\r\n       bytes32 messageId \u003d receivedMessage.messageId;\r\n       uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d receivedMessage.sourceChainSelector;\r\n       address sender \u003d abi.decode(receivedMessage.sender, (address));\r\n       (address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) \u003d abi.decode(\r\n           receivedMessage.data,\r\n           (address, uint256)\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       address tokenToReturn \u003d s_destinationToSourceMap[\r\n           keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenAddress, sourceChainSelector))\r\n       ];\r\n\r\n       uint256 currentBalance \u003d IERC20(tokenToReturn).balanceOf(address(this));\r\n\r\n       // If there are not enough funds in LPSC, withdraw additional from Aave vault\r\n       if (currentBalance \u003c amount) {\r\n           withdrawFromVault(tokenToReturn, amount - currentBalance);\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokenAmounts;\r\n       tokenAmounts[1] \u003d (Client.EVMTokenAmount(tokenToReturn, amount));\r\n\r\n       Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory messageReply \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n           receiver: abi.encode(sender),\r\n           data: abi.encode(msgId),\r\n           tokenAmounts: tokenAmounts,\r\n           extraArgs: \"\",\r\n           feeToken: LINK\r\n       });\r\n\r\n       bytes32 replyMessageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend(\r\n           sourceChainSelector,\r\n           messageReply\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       //  emit ReplySent(replyMessageId,sourceChainSelector, messageId, sender, tokenToReturn, amount);\r\n   }\r\n Finally, the smart contract on the chain that requested funds to top up a debt position receives the CCIP programmable token transfer, matches up the request ID with it’s original request, and then takes the funds and deposits the transferred funds into the debt position in order to increase the collateralization of the loan and avoid a liquidation: function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory receivedMessage\r\n    ) internal override {\r\n        _isCcipMessageSent \u003d false;\r\n        bytes32 requestMessageId \u003d abi.decode(receivedMessage.data, (bytes32));\r\n        uint256 amountToRepay \u003d requested[requestMessageId];\r\n        IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).repay(\r\n            i_tokenAddress,\r\n            amountToRepay,\r\n            i_onBehalfOf\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n This example demonstrates how CCIP can be utilized in DeFi protocols and DeFi position monitoring applications to provide users with trust-minimized liquidation protection of their debt positions across multiple blockchains while allowing them to keep their funds and liquidity on a single blockchain. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Liquidation Protector GitHub repository. Cross-Chain Domain Name Service Decentralized domain name services like ENS are extremely popular in Web3, as they facilitate the translation of human readable names to wallet addresses. In an ideal world, domain name services should not be specific to one chain, but each registered domain should propagate and live across all Ethereum chains, side chains, layer 2s, and app chains. This would allow users to have a single, unified identity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, as opposed to having to register domains across multiple naming services or using interoperability solutions that aren’t trust-minimized. However, to achieve this, domain name services would be required to communicate with other blockchains. Each instance of the naming service on a blockchain would need to be notified when new domains are registered, and there would need to be a way to perform “lookups” against a global name registry across all blockchains. This example showcases how you could build a simplified cross-chain naming service application, where users could register domains on one chain and have that registration propagate across multiple other blockchains as well as resolve names to addresses across any blockchain. Overview of cross-chain naming architecture The first step is to deploy the CrossChainNameServiceRegister and CrossChainNameServiceLookup contracts to the Ethereum Sepolia network. This network will act as the “home” network where all registrations will occur, and then propagate to other chains. When you register a new .ccns handle, the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract will use CCIP to send a message to other supported blockchains containing information about the registered .ccns handle: uint256 length \u003d s_chains.length;\r\n       for (uint256 i; i \u003c length; ) {\r\n           Chain memory currentChain \u003d s_chains[i];\r\n\r\n           Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n               receiver: abi.encode(currentChain.ccnsReceiverAddress),\r\n               data: abi.encode(_name, msg.sender),\r\n               tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n               extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\n                   Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({\r\n                       gasLimit: currentChain.gasLimit,\r\n                       strict: currentChain.strict\r\n                   })\r\n               ),\r\n               feeToken: address(0) // We leave the feeToken empty indicating we\u0027ll pay raw native.\r\n           });\r\n\r\n           i_router.ccipSend{\r\n               value: i_router.getFee(currentChain.chainSelector, message)\r\n           }(currentChain.chainSelector, message);\r\n\r\n           unchecked {\r\n               ++i;\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       i_lookup.register(_name, msg.sender);\r\n On all the supported receiving blockchains, the CrossChainNameServiceReceiver contract would be deployed. This contract would receive registered .ccns domains from the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract, and would store them in the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract deployed on that blockchain: constructor(\r\n        address router,\r\n        address lookup,\r\n        uint64 sourceChainSelector\r\n    ) CCIPReceiver(router) {\r\n        i_router \u003d IRouterClient(router);\r\n        i_lookup \u003d ICrossChainNameServiceLookup(lookup);\r\n        i_sourceChainSelector \u003d sourceChainSelector;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message\r\n    ) internal override onlyFromSourceChain(message.sourceChainSelector) {\r\n        (string memory _name, address _address) \u003d abi.decode(\r\n            message.data,\r\n            (string, address)\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        i_lookup.register(_name, _address);\r\n    }\r\n Finally, the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract would be deployed on all blockchains, including the registering blockchain (in this case, Sepolia), as well as all destination blockchains. This contract would be used to store all registered .ccns handles and act as an interface to perform lookups to translate names to addresses: function register(\r\n        string memory _name,\r\n        address _address\r\n    ) external onlyCrossChainNameService {\r\n        if (lookup[_name] !\u003d address(0)) revert AlreadyTaken();\r\n\r\n        lookup[_name] \u003d _address;\r\n    }\r\n Using this simple design pattern, it becomes possible to create a simple cross-chain domain name service where users can register a domain once, then own and use it across multiple blockchains. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain Name Service GitHub repository. Cross-Chain NFTs NFTs are one of the most popular use cases in Web3. Each NFT project is usually on a single blockchain, or the project itself has multiple deployments across multiple chains, with end-users having to mint the NFT more than once if they want to own it on multiple blockchains. With CCIP Arbitrary Messaging, NFT projects can allow for their assets to be minted once on a single chain, paid for once by the minter, and then have them propagated to the user on other blockchains. This means users can own and share their NFT, irrespective of which network they are using. CCIP can also be used to “burn and mint” NFTs across chains, allowing users to move their NFTs from one chain to another. Here is an example of how the first scenario works: The MyNFT contract contains a simple NFT smart contract with a mint function: function mint(address to) public {\r\n    unchecked {\r\n        tokenId++;\r\n    }\r\n    _safeMint(to, tokenId);\r\n}\r\n The sourceMinter contract is deployed on the source chain, and contains logic in its mint function to send a CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature from the MyNFT.sol smart contract to the destination blockchain: function mint(\r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver,\r\n        PayFeesIn payFeesIn\r\n    ) external {\r\n        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n            receiver: abi.encode(receiver),\r\n            data: abi.encodeWithSignature(\"mint(address)\", msg.sender),\r\n            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n            extraArgs: \"\",\r\n            feeToken: payFeesIn \u003d\u003d PayFeesIn.LINK ? i_link : address(0)\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        uint256 fee \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).getFee(\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            message\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        bytes32 messageId;\r\n\r\n        if (payFeesIn \u003d\u003d PayFeesIn.LINK) {\r\n            LinkTokenInterface(i_link).approve(i_router, fee);\r\n            messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend(\r\n                destinationChainSelector,\r\n                message\r\n            );\r\n        } else {\r\n            messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend{value: fee}(\r\n                destinationChainSelector,\r\n                message\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        emit MessageSent(messageId);\r\n The DestinationMinter smart contract will receive the CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature as a payload, and call the mint function in the MyNFT smart contract function using it. The MyNFT smart contract will then mint the new NFT to the msg.sender account from the mint() function of the SourceMinter smart contract, i.e. to the same account address for which the NFT was minted on the source chain: function _ccipReceive(\r\n    Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message\r\n) internal override {\r\n    (bool success, ) \u003d address(nft).call(message.data);\r\n    require(success);\r\n    emit MintCallSuccessfull();\r\n}\r\n The end result is that the user that minted the NFT now owns the NFT on multiple chains, and they only had to mint and pay for it once. If the NFT project wants to remain strictly non-fungible even across blockchains, this solution can also be easily modified to mint the NFT on a destination blockchain and burn it on the source chain afterwards, ensuring there is only ever one version of it across all blockchains. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain NFT GitHub repository. Gaming: Cross-Chain Tic-Tac-Toe In the past couple of years, Web3 gaming has become massively popular. However, like DeFi, gaming is very fragmented, with games and their assets usually being specific to a certain chain. But like traditional gaming, the ultimate goal or best experience is when you have gamers that can play a game together, irrespective of the hardware or software they’re playing on. Just like how a PC gamer can play games with Xbox console owners, there should be no reason why someone can’t play a game on Polygon with someone playing on Avalanche. This is known as cross-platform gaming. This translates perfectly to turn-based Web3 games and other games that do not require fast real-time interaction. Web3 gaming suffers from user fragmentation, with gamers preferring to play on their chain of choice and use their preferred digital assets. CCIP enables Web3 games to be truly cross-chain, facilitating the transferring of assets across chains and enabling a shared game state across multiple blockchains, allowing gamers to play each other regardless of the chain they want to use. If you want to reach as many gamers as possible, then it makes sense to have your game deployed across multiple chains and design it in a way where all players can play against or with each other. A simple demonstration of this cross-chain gaming design pattern can be shown with a turn-based strategy game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. In this example, we have a game smart contract that is deployed on multiple blockchains. Users can then start a game on their chain of choice and then share the game session ID with their friends. Their friends can then join the game from another chain if they wish. On game creation, CCIP will have shared the game details and initial state with all the other chains: struct GameSession {\r\n        bytes32 sessionId;\r\n        address player_1; // player who starts the game\r\n        address player_2; // the other player in the game\r\n        address winner; // winner of game\r\n        address turn; // check who takes action in next step\r\n        uint8[9] player1Status; // current status for player 1\r\n        uint8[9] player2Status; // current status for player 2\r\n    }\r\n    mapping(bytes32 \u003d\u003e GameSession) public gameSessions;\r\n    bytes32[] public sessionIds;\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction start(uint64 destinationChainSelector, address receiver) external {\r\n        bytes32 uniqueId \u003d keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender));\r\n        sessionIds.push(uniqueId);\r\n        gameSessions[uniqueId]\u003d GameSession(\r\n            uniqueId,\r\n            msg.sender,\r\n            address(0),\r\n            address(0),\r\n            msg.sender,\r\n            initialCombination,\r\n            initialCombination\r\n            );\r\n\r\n        sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[uniqueId]);\r\n    }\r\n Once the first player has taken a turn after initiating the game, the second player on another blockchain will see the updated game state on their game smart contract once the CCIP message is successfully processed. Player 2 will then take their turn, which will generate a CCIP message to get sent back to player 1 and update the state of the game on their chain: function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory any2EvmMessage\r\n    ) internal override {\r\n        bytes32 messageId \u003d any2EvmMessage.messageId; // fetch the messageId\r\n        uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector; // fetch the source chain identifier (aka selector)\r\n        address sender \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)); // abi-decoding of the sender address\r\n        GameSession memory message \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (GameSession)); // abi-decoding of the sent string message\r\n        receivedMessages.push(messageId);\r\n        Message memory detail \u003d Message(sourceChainSelector, sender, message);\r\n        messageDetail[messageId] \u003d detail;\r\n        gameSessions[message.sessionId] \u003d message;\r\n        sessionIds.push(message.sessionId);\r\n\r\n        emit MessageReceived(messageId, sourceChainSelector, sender, message);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n function move(\r\n        uint256 x, \r\n        uint256 y, \r\n        uint256 player, \r\n        bytes32 sessionId, \r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver) \r\n        public  \r\n    {\r\n        GameSession memory gs \u003d gameSessions[sessionId];\r\n        // make sure the game session setup and not over.\r\n        require(gs.player_1 !\u003d address(0), \"the session is not setup, please start game first!\");\r\n        require(gs.winner \u003d\u003d address(0), \"the game is over\");\r\n        \r\n        // make sure the player is in the game session\r\n        require(player \u003d\u003d 1 || player \u003d\u003d 2, \"you must be player1 or player2\"); //this is used to when player has the same address\r\n        \r\n        if(player \u003d\u003d 1) {\r\n            // make sure it is player1\u0027s turn to move\r\n            require(gs.player_1 \u003d\u003d msg.sender \u0026\u0026 gs.turn \u003d\u003d msg.sender, \"it is not your turn\");\r\n            \r\n            // 1. if the position is not taken by the opponent, then take the position\r\n            if(gs.player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 gs.player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0) {\r\n               gameSessions[sessionId].player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d 1;\r\n               \r\n               // 2. check if player1 wins or make the turn to the opponent, send the message\r\n               if(checkWin(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(gameSessions[sessionId].player1Status)))) {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].winner \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_1;\r\n               } else {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].turn \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_2;\r\n               }\r\n               sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[sessionId]);\r\n            } else {\r\n                revert(\"the position is occupied\");\r\n            }\r\n        } else if(player \u003d\u003d 2) {\r\n            // make sure it is player2\u0027s turn to move, this is the first step for player2\r\n            require((gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d msg.sender \u0026\u0026 gs.turn \u003d\u003d msg.sender) || gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d address(0), \"it is not your turn\");\r\n\r\n            if(gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d address(0)) {\r\n                gameSessions[sessionId].player_2 \u003d msg.sender;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // 1. if the position is not taken by the opponent, then take the position\r\n            if(gs.player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 gs.player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0) {\r\n               gameSessions[sessionId].player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d 1; \r\n\r\n               // 2. check if player1 wins or make the turn to the opponent, send the message\r\n               if(checkWin(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(gameSessions[sessionId].player2Status)))) {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].winner \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_2;\r\n               } else {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].turn \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_1;\r\n               }\r\n               sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[sessionId]);\r\n            } else {\r\n                revert(\"the position is occupied\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n Player 1 will then see the updated game state and make their move once again. This back and forth of CCIP messages between chains will continue to happen as the gamers make their moves until the game reaches a conclusion and a winner is declared. The important thing to note here is that the game smart contracts on both chains both maintain the game state, with CCIP being used to send and receive messages to ensure game state is maintained across both blockchains: function checkWin(bytes32 combination) public view returns (bool) {\r\n        return wcs[combination];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Sends data to receiver on the destination chain.\r\n    /// @dev Assumes your contract has sufficient native asset (e.g, ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon...).\r\n    /// @param destinationChainSelector The identifier (aka selector) for the destination blockchain.\r\n    /// @param receiver The address of the recipient on the destination blockchain.\r\n    /// @param message The string message to be sent.\r\n    /// @return messageId The ID of the message that was sent.\r\n    function sendMessage(\r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver,\r\n        GameSession memory message\r\n    ) public returns (bytes32 messageId) {\r\n        // Create an EVM2AnyMessage struct in memory with necessary information for sending a cross-chain message\r\n        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory evm2AnyMessage \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n            receiver: abi.encode(receiver), // ABI-encoded receiver address\r\n            data: abi.encode(msg), // ABI-encoded string message\r\n            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0), // Empty array indicating no tokens are being sent\r\n            extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\n                Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 400_000, strict: false}) // Additional arguments, setting gas limit and non-strict sequency mode\r\n            ),\r\n            feeToken: address(0) // Setting feeToken to zero address, indicating native asset will be used for fees\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // Initialize a router client instance to interact with cross-chain router\r\n        IRouterClient router \u003d IRouterClient(_router);\r\n\r\n        // Get the fee required to send the message\r\n        uint256 fees \u003d router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n        // Send the message through the router and store the returned message ID\r\n        messageId \u003d router.ccipSend{value: fees}(\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            evm2AnyMessage\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // Emit an event with message details\r\n        emit MessageSent(\r\n            messageId,\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            receiver,\r\n            message,\r\n            fees\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // Return the message ID\r\n        return messageId;\r\n    }\r\n The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Tic-Tac-Toe GitHub repository.

    "summary": "Author Zachary Small details the behind-the-scenes events that brought the digital artist and Christie\u0027s auction house together in the first chapter of their book.\n\n",
    "content": "Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christie’s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmann’s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreography of this historic moment.\n\nZachary Small, a New York Times reporter writing about the art world\u0027s relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of \"Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,\" published by Penguin Random House.\n\nThe artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.\n\nOnce upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailor’s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value of compartmentalization, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.\n\nThe computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmann’s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming “boring as sh*t.” The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrative short films through a webcam than working for a software company. The Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.\n\nIn 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The \"Everydays\" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nA recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trump’s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.\n\nSee also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?\n\nAll that chaos was contained in Winkelmann’s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, and two 65-inch screen televisions that played CNN and Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internet’s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?\n\nBeeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway. One piece was called \"Politics Is Bullshit,\" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.\n\n“If you need extra convincing from some BS artist’s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,” Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. “Smash the buy button ya jabroni.”\n\nPoof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price – decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever – Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue for financializing his digital art, one that built upon the lucrative market for online collectibles that companies like Dapper Labs and Larva Labs had started in 2017 with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: “There’s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,” he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. “We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.”\n\nWinkelmann’s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy companies.\n\nThey wanted permanence. They wanted cultural capital.\n\nIn 2017, Christie’s made a Renaissance painting the marquee lot in their November sale of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artwork’s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown prince’s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.\n\nRestructuring continued in 2020, as Christie’s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departments into one office. “Our clients don’t think in categories anymore,” Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.\n\nThe decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s – shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.\n\nIronically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that Christie’s announced that its top lot for the \"20th Century Evening Sale\" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.\n\nMany employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.\n\nSee also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He\u0027s Writing About It\n\n“I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,” Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another competing over the bragging rights of ownership. Connoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.\n\n“All I know is that I know nothing,” Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called “Knowledge” by the California punk band Operation Ivy.\n\nSo, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. “It will be fun and a little weird,” he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the perfect auction. But the most important detail was still missing: what was Beeple going to make? The artist had originally suggested one of his \"Everydays\" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.\n\n“Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,” Doyle said, declining the proposal.\n\nWinkelmann returned with a new idea. “I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,” he remembered. “And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.” Instead of offering a single work, he decided to combine everything he had created over the last fourteen years into a single composite, sold as an NFT.\n\n“He came back to us with a magnum opus,” Doyle said. “With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.”\n\nHowever, Ito found the level of involvement from Christie’s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors – “whales,” as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.\n\nIn January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metaverse to celebrate his $2.2-million purchase of twenty Beeple NFTs and the opening of a gallery that he had commissioned Web architects to build in the online world of Origin City. Back then, he was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into “King of Meta.”\n\nSundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of “Bitcoin ATMs,” which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.\n\nIn 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digital real-estate market. A year later, he started using the name MetaKovan, which he describes as his “exosuit” created for “building the metaverse.”\n\nAt the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverse’s first large-scale public art project.\n\n“We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,” the company said in its newsletter. “Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.”\n\nIto had been watching Sundaresan for a while; he understood how the crypto millionaire operated and that he had an affinity for the guttural sci-fi fantasies that Beeple was selling. More important, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.\n\nGradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christie’s “know your customer” process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse – another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran – who played more of a backseat advisory role in the acquisition process.\n\nThe marketing juggernaut at Christie’s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmann’s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event with its own subtitle, like an Avengers movie – \"Everydays: The First 5000 Days.\" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write “estimate unknown,” a cheeky nod to the usual “inquire for estimate” phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.\n\n“Estimate unknown.” That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasn’t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.\n\n“Noah looked at me and said, ‘We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,’ ” Winkelmann recalled.\n\nCompliance officers and executives at Christie’s were still debating the financial terms of the deal. The original plan was for the house to accept cryptocurrency for the hammer price but require that its own premium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.\n\nSuccess needed to be measured with the company’s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.\n\n“A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,” Doyle said. “The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.”\n\nThe gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his participation in the auction, but what nobody expected was another competitor willing to participate in one of the most furious online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.\n\nOn February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.\n\n“I was shocked that our website could handle it,” Doyle said. “I had never seen that happen.”\n\nThe auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christie’s. Most were millennials.\n\nSee also: What\u0027s Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?\n\n“It was a psychotic amount of bidding,” Davis thought as his phone started blowing up with messages. His boss, Alex Rotter, head of 20th-and-21st-century art, even took to social media to brag about the sale. He posted a Beeple artwork to his Instagram featuring a superpowered Homer Simpson lobotomizing his son, Bart Simpson, with laser vision.\n\n“Beeple leads the way,” Rotter captioned the image. “It’s all happening.”\n\nThis excerpt has been lightly edited.\n\n",

They are not, however, cleared to trade. Although the SEC approved the 19B-4 form that allows for the offering and listing of ETFs, it must still green light the funds\u0027 S-1 filings before investors can buy them.\n\nThe regulator approved documents for eight ETFs – from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy and BlackRock – for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.\n\nIf the ETFs are approved for trading, a significant influx of institutional capital is likely. Standard Chartered predicted inflows of as much as $45 billion in the first 12 months.\n\nSome traders say they expect ether to rally over 60% in the coming months, with a marked increase in futures and spot buying demand for the token in the past week.\n\n",

    "content": "A bunch of Ethereum ecosystem tokens rocketed in the past 24 hours after two Bloomberg analysts raised their odds on the approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nThe cat-themed mog (MOG) token, a reference to a popular TikTok meme, rose nearly 50% while the frog-themed pepe (PEPE) surged more than 20%. Both were initially issued on Ethereum in 2023 and have since become mainstays, alongside bigger ones such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nAmong utility projects, staking application Lido’s LDO rose 15%, while the ARB token of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum jumped 18%. DOGE and SHIB added 6%.\n\nMeme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\n“Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),” a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.\n\n“I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\nThe focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn\u0027t unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto proponents used to posit that \"code is law.\" Courts and legal pundits ultimately forced the phrase into retirement. But there\u0027s still plenty of money in figuring out how the two intertwine.\n\nOne such effort is crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro\u0027s MetaLeX, a hybrid law firm/tech company focused on the mess that crypto projects make when trying to \"decentralize.\" MetaLeX recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding led by Cyber Fund. It is now valued at $27.5 million, Shapiro said.\n\nUnlike their \"centralized\" counterparts in the traditional business world, many crypto projects seek to \"decentralize\" by giving their tokenholders control of budgets and other core operations. It\u0027s a costly, cumbersome, failure-prone journey that has bedeviled major DeFi players like SushiSwap and often leaves the organization open to make arbitrary decisions that break their own ethos.\n\nInto this fray steps Shapiro\u0027s incredibly niche MetaLeX. In an interview with CoinDesk, he described it as a \"business-to-business, crypto software as a services\" company that\u0027s designing standardized, smart contract-based processes for so-called decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, to properly run themselves on-chain.\n\nIn MetaLeX lingo, the name for this newfangled construct is a Cybernetic Organization, or BORG. Think of it as a cyborg equivalent for legal entities. They\u0027ll be governed by hard-coded, smart contract-enforced rules infused into their charters, according to the project whitepaper.\n\n\"What makes them kind of unique is the way they mandate smart contract functionality\" in their operations,\" Shapiro said. \"That makes them \u0027cybernetic.\u0027\"\n\nMetaLeX\u0027s first product will be an operating system for DAOs to BORGify their governance decision processes with constructs to run grantmaking, emergency shutdowns and venture investments made on behalf of the entity, he said.\n\nCrypto projects are reaching out \"every day\" to join the waitlist for MetaLeX OS, Shapiro said, including two \"blue chip\" projects, though he declined to identify them beyond saying they were a layer-2 blockchain and a \"traditional DeFi DAO.\"\n\n\"They both want to fully BORGify their operations,\" he said.\n\nNot every crypto project can be easily BORGified. Those that have already launched tokens and DAO governance processes are more difficult to work with than pre-token projects, Shapiro said.\n\nMetaLeX is not itself a BORG or a DAO or anything that crypto-native. It\u0027s an umbrella brand for a Delaware corporation (the tech company) and a Texas limited liability partnership (the law firm led by Shapiro and Alex Golubitsky). Clients could use one or both, Shapiro said.\n\nMetaLeX could one day have its own token if it evolves to become a legal protocol that requires governance by its customers, Shapiro said.\n\n\"It will probably take a while before we would get to that point. But ultimately I think it will get there,\" he said.\n\n",

    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\n\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\n\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n\n“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\n\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\n\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\n\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.\n\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\n\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n\n“Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\n\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n\n",

    "content": "Donald J. Trump has pledged to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence to time served if he’s re-elected president.\n\n“If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump said during his Saturday night remarks at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C. “He’s already served 11 years, we’re gonna get him home.”\n\nHours before those remarks, Trump took to social media to praise the crypto industry, writing on Truth Social:\n\n“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump wrote, adding that President Joe Biden “wants [the cryptocurrency industry] to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me!”\n\nIn his evening address, Trump’s pledge to free Ulbricht was met with raucous cheers from the assembled audience, many of whom were holding up signs reading “Free Ross.”\n\nIn 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus 40 years – effectively, life in prison without the possibility of parole – for creating and operating Silk Road. The now-defunct darknet marketplace was used to anonymously buy and sell goods, but was largely used for drugs. Silk Road operated from 2011 to 2013 and is widely considered the first real-world use case for Bitcoin.\n\nUlbricht has become something of a martyr for many in the crypto community, as well as to many Libertarians, who see Ulbricht’s draconian sentence as a governmental overstep and a violation of his constitutional rights. In 2018, the Libertarian Party called on then-President Trump to pardon Ulbricht.\n\nBefore Trump’s presidency ended in January 2021, he granted clemency to 143 individuals – pardoning 73, including Ripple board member Ken Kurson, and commuting the sentences of 70 others. He did not offer clemency to Ulbricht, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, who released details about a U.S. surveillance program to American journalist Glenn Greenwald.\n\nTrump also made more general comments about cryptocurrency at the convention, telling attendees that he would “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush crypto – we’re gonna stop it.”\n\n“I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. I will support the right to self custody,” Trump said, to cheers. “To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”\n\nTrump has warmed up considerably to crypto in recent months, making several pro-crypto comments publicly and becoming the first major party presidential candidate to accept crypto donations.\n\nRead more: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\n",

    "summary": "By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, Montclair State University adjunct professor Burak Tamac writes.\n\n",
    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\n\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\n\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.\n\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\n\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\n\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\n\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\n\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\n\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\n\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n\n",

Brian Timmons, partner at Los Angeles-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, which is representing BitGo in this case.\n\nBitGo filed suit against Galaxy in August 2022, seeking $100 million in damages and alleging that Galaxy “intentionally” breached its May 2021 merger agreement when it could no longer afford the $1.2 billion price tag after experiencing massive financial losses during the crypto bear market. Galaxy blamed the breakup on BitGo’s failure to provide certain audited financial statements on time and said BitGo’s claims were “without merit.”\n\nLast June, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled that Galaxy had a “valid basis” to pull out of the agreement, because BitGo gave the firm “non-compliant” financial documents.\n\nAfter BitGo appealed the ruling, the state’s Supreme Court found that the merger agreement’s definition of “financial statements” was ambiguous, and that both parties “have proffered reasonable interpretations” of acceptable documentation, and reversed the ruling.\n\n\"We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and remain confident in the merits of our position in the case,\" a Galaxy spokesperson told CoinDesk.\n\nUPDATE (May 25, 2024 at 00:35 UTC): Updated to include a statement from Galaxy Digital.\n\n",

    "summary": "Plume plans to make it possible for people to easily – and compliantly – bring real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and collectibles onto blockchains.\n\n",
    "content": "As blockchain vies for mainstream acceptance this week in the halls of the United States Congress, a growing number of compliance-oriented crypto projects are hopeful that a more favorable regulatory environment could soon lead to a surge in blockchain-based RWAs, or real-world assets.\n\nOne such startup, Plume, has raised $10 million in seed funding for what it says will be the first layer-2 blockchain purpose-built for RWAs. The round was led by Haun Ventures and included participation from Galaxy Ventures, Superscrypt, A Capital, SV Angel, Portal Ventures and Reciprocal Ventures.\n\nPlume\u0027s Ethereum-based blockchain is pitched as a one-stop shop for easily bringing off-chain assets onto blockchains, meaning the protocol helps people navigate the morass of paperwork, custodial requirements and other legwork required to bring things like real estate, art and certain kinds of financial instruments onto blockchains.\n\n\"The RWA industry is one of the fastest-growing verticals in crypto today but there remains a critical gap – to date there has not been a permissionless blockchain equipped with fullstack RWA infrastructure to deploy any asset class compliantly,\" the company explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. \"The robust DeFi ecosystem on Plume enables users to do everything with RWAs – from earning yield, borrowing/lending, trading and speculating with leverage.\"\n\nPlume\u0027s underlying technology is based on Arbitrum Nitro – a framework for building layer-2 \"rollup\" chains that write transactions to Ethereum quickly and with low fees. The tech should make it simple for the chain to interoperate and swap assets across other chains in the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem – a constellation of other rollups built using the same framework.\n\n\"When we started talking to protocols, everyone said the same thing: \u0027It takes us anywhere between six months, a year, a year and a half, two years to actually get this asset on-chain before we can even write a single line of code for our protocol,\u0027\" Plume co-founder Chris Yin said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"That\u0027s just a ridiculous way to do things – it\u0027s just duplicative work across every single protocol. We say, let\u0027s standardize that.\"\n\nOn Plume, \"you have a very comprehensive set of features to actually tokenize an asset – meaning setting up your entity, filing the stuff, taking custody of the assets, doing wallets, automatic set-up, cap table management, on/off-ramping, [know-your-customer] – all of those things are baked in,\" said Yin. \"We just take these products, we integrate them and put a nice UI on it and make sure that it\u0027s nicely modular.\"\n\nAccording to Yin, Plume currently has more than 80 projects deploying real-world assets onto its private test network. \"Everything from collectibles, private credit, real estate – all these things are deploying on Plume,\" he said.\n\nYin says Plume plans to open up its testnet to the public within \"a month or so,\" with a full release to follow later on.\n\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "content": "A single picture on Monday sparked rallies across some cat-themed meme coins and Gamestop stock (NYSE: GME) as market cults heralded the apparent return of TheRoaringKitty, the X profile of retail trader Keith Gill, who made his first post since late 2021.\n\nGill posted a meme that refers to a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration. Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\n\nStocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.\n\nAn unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.\n\nGill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\n\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\n\nGill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n\n",

Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows.\n\nA Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed.\n\nSome traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half.\n\n“While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term \u0027sell the news\u0027 reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email.\n\n“This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.\n\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n\n",

    "title": "‘Innovation Continues to Occur in Siloes’: DTCC Digital Head Nadine Chakar on Responsible Blockchain Building\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "One of the most powerful women in finance talks to CoinDesk ahead of her Consensus appearance.\n\n",
    "content": "Nadine Chakar is often called one the most powerful women in finance. As global head of the digital asset wing at DTCC, which settles an astronomical amount of transactions annually (in the quadrillions), she has a front row seat to how technology is reinventing finance before our very eyes. Which might be why she’s become such a staunch advocate for blockchain-based innovations. Nadine Chakar is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\n“With tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business models and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels. Firms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing processes while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity – and they can likely do it cheaper and faster,” Chakar wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.\n\nChakar, who has over 30 years of experience of global wealth and asset management experience, has essentially charted her own path through the world of finance. Before DTCC (which acquired her compliance-focused tokenization firm Securrency in 2023), Chakar served as an executive vice president at State Street, where she essentially built out the State Street Digital unit after a stint as executive vice president of the firm’s global markets division.\n\n“This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation,” Chakar said in an interview.\n\nSee also: What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Chakar to discuss her career history, how she views digital transformation and what responsible regulation for crypto would look like.\n\nTo what extent did your career at places like State Street Digital and BNY Mellon prepare you to lead the digital asset business at DTCC?\n\nI have a history of working at heavily-regulated financial institutions, which has given me expertise leading teams that can innovate in a responsible, transparent way that meets the highest regulatory standards. However, given my time as CEO of Securrency, I’ve witnessed the power of a fintech that can innovate quickly. This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation.\n\nNow that Securrency has become DTCC Digital Assets, I believe we’re leveraging the best of both worlds. We combine DTCC’s legacy of trust and experience as the infrastructure for the world’s largest capital markets with Securrency best-in-class technology capabilities.\n\nAre you observing digital assets impacting traditional financial markets?\n\nI believe digital assets are largely operating in a different universe from traditional markets. However, I think we’re at a turning point where the two are starting to converge. A major challenge is that innovation continues to occur in siloes, where financial institutions will team up with a fintech [company] to launch a pilot, only to culminate with a press release and then fizzle out afterward.\n\nWe’re calling for a change in approach: we should focus on large-scale pilots with many participants and have experiments build upon each other incrementally to begin building a larger, interoperable digital asset ecosystem that can power digital markets.\n\nIt\u0027s often said that market structure for digital assets needs reform: Do you have ideas of what this should look like?\n\nWe require an ecosystem for digital assets that’s worthy of the one we have for traditional assets today. First and foremost, we need infrastructure that can connect traditional systems with the digital ecosystem and that provides the same level of soundness and safety of existing offerings. Second, we must ensure we’re facilitating how assets and processes can move across multiple blockchains.\n\nThird, we must have a clear legal and regulatory framework to establish controls and standards. This is essential, and it should include standards for data, including its use and collection, methods to protect private data and establishing exactly what data is allowed on-chain.\n\nSee also: A Crypto Developer\u0027s Guide to Consensus 2024\n\nOf course, DTCC has been bringing this sort of expertise to the markets for over 50 years. We have the established ecosystem for traditional securities, which will serve as the foundation for creating the digital infrastructure of the future. We are also here to help guide the evolution of the regulatory framework over time to support digital assets.\n\nWe can’t do it alone. This is why we’ve partnered with other financial market infrastructures, Euroclear and Clearstream, to issue a new paper that lays out the path forward for developing this ecosystem in a measured and collaborative way. We’re excited to announce the paper at Consensus.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nNetworking and connecting with colleagues. It’s worth repeating: the path to creating the digital asset ecosystem starts with collaboration. While there will always be room for firms to compete with their own bright ideas and compelling use cases, we won’t make meaningful progress on tokenization without working together. I’m excited for the industry to collaborate to bring a robust, interoperable digital asset ecosystem to life.\n\n",

SOL, XRP), markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story, not a 2024 one,” analyst Geoffrey Kendric said. “For now, bitcoin and ether dominance will rise, with selective “next in line” winners as well.”\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved forms 19b-4 filed by would-be issuers. While this is an important step in the race to launch a spot ether ETF, it is only one of two forms that needs approval from the regulator.\n\nIt could take the SEC weeks if not months – even potentially indefinitely – to approve the S-1 document, which has so far only been filed by a few potential issuers.\n\nSeveral industry experts have suggested that SOL would be a logical choice for a third ETF, given its similarities to Ethereum.\n\nBrokerage firm Bernstein said in a note on Thursday that given Ethereum’s classification as a commodity, the token could follow a similar path. Solana is the third biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether by market cap. This is excluding stablecoin Tether (USDT) and Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nCORRECTION (May 24, 2024, 15:14 UTC): Fixes XRP\u0027s ticker symbol in the headline.\n\n",

    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\n\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\n\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\n\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\n\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\n\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\n\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n\n",

    "content": "The newest product from liquid restaking startup Ether.fi could finally help \"paper rich\" crypto degens turn their blockchain investments into spending money.\n\nEther.fi Cash will be a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that borrows USDC, the popular USD-pegged stablecoin, against one\u0027s decentralized finance (DeFi) investments and can be paid off directly via crypto.\n\n\"Our mission is to build a suite of integrated apps that make DeFi actually usable for normal people,\" said Ether.fi founder Mike Silagadze. \"Cash is your spending account, with the dream being that you never have to off-ramp\" from the blockchain. \"Off-ramping\" refers to the tedious (and fee-laden) process of converting between cash and crypto.\n\nToday, Ether.fi is best known as a service for funneling assets into EigenLayer, the Ethereum-based restaking giant that helps investors secure upstart blockchain services in exchange for rewards. EigenLayer has drawn in some $18 billion worth of deposits over the past year, with over $5.5 billion coming from users who initially deposited their money into Ether.fi in exchange for eETH tokens – a kind of receipt on EigenLayer deposits that can be traded in crypto markets like any other asset.\n\nRead more: With Mastercard, MetaMask Tests First Blockchain-Powered Payment Card\n\nIn addition to its \"Stake\" program, Ether.fi also has a \"Liquid\" program, where users can deposit their funds into vaults that follow hand-curated trading strategies.\n\nEther.fi Cash cardholders will be able to borrow funds against their Stake or Liquid deposits and use the interest from those investments to automatically pay off their bills. Users can alternatively convert assets directly into USDC, allowing for instant settlement.\n\nWith Cash, \"you on-ramp once onto Ether.fi and then you never have to off-ramp again because you can save, invest, and spend all your money,\" said Silagadze. \"You can get paid in crypto, and you can just live your life normally without plugging into the TradFi ecosystem.\" Ether.fi aims to offer a crypto-centric rewards program akin to those offered by Chase and other legacy card providers. It also aims to differentiate itself from traditional credit cards through its fee structure, which will follow the DeFi market rather than the standard 15-30% APR charged by regular credit cards.\n\nCash is not the first swing at a crypto-based card, but Silagadze insists that previous attempts to build similar products have amounted to \"garbage.\"\n\n\"Most of them are Visa debit cards,\" he said. \"Visa debit cards are pointless because you can only use them for, like, hotels and car rentals. You can\u0027t use them for a lot of stuff. They\u0027re just not practical.\"\n\n\"This is an actual credit card,\" Silagadze emphasized.\n\nHe expects Cash to roll out to consumers starting in September, but it is unlikely, for regulatory reasons, to be available in certain large markets, including the U.S..\n\nUsing crypto as cash will always have its unique complexities – from market considerations to tax implications.\n\n\"Initially, this is designed for crypto natives,\" said Silagadze, \"But if somebody is thinking of becoming a proper degen, looking at something like this might make them feel like, \u0027Alright, this actually helps me navigate this universe.\u0027\"\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\n\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\n\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\n\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\n\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\n\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\n\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\n\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\n\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\n\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\n\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\n\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\n\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\n\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\n\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\n\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\n\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.\n\nOther majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano\u0027s ADA, Solana\u0027s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.\n\nShorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u0027s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u0027s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nMarkets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.\n\nMarket participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.\n\n“Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.”\n\n",

    "title": "3 Questions About the SEC’s Abrupt ETH ETF Approval\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Was the decision politically motivated? What does it mean for Ethereum going forward? Will other leading chains benefit too?\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed yesterday it has approved critical rule changes to allow for exchange-traded funds holding Ethereum’s native token, ETH. A lot of people were caught off guard, considering that just last week nearly everyone – from Bloomberg analysts to prediction markets – thought it was a lost cause.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nIt never really made sense to me why SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would hold out on approving these spot ETH products, considering how the agency was embarrassed during its proactive fight over listing bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRecall that a three-person panel of judges in an appeals court called the SEC’s reasoning for denying (and denying and denying) spot bitcoin funds “arbitrary and capricious,” as it had already approved bitcoin futures products that did substantially the same thing. The same situation has been true for ETH as well, and it’s likely that some firm would have been happy to litigate the matter in the same way Digital Currency Group went to bat for bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis time around, the SEC’s decision seems just as arbitrary, just in the opposite direction. In an interview with CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton hours before the approval became public, Gensler said he’d follow “how the courts interpret the law” and that the “DC Circuit took a different view, and we took that into consideration and pivoted.”\n\nSee also: Ether ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn\u0027t Cleared Them for Trading Yet\n\nSo why now? What does it mean for Ethereum going forward? And does this bode well for other cryptos?\n\nAs many have already noted, it appears there has been a seachange regarding crypto’s regulatory situation. On Thursday, the House took a historic vote to approve the most substantive piece of crypto-specific legislation to date. This came on the heels of both the upper and lower houses of Congress voting to repeal a controversial SEC crypto custody accounting rule.\n\nWith significant participation from Democrats in both bills, it appears that the U.S. government’s long war on crypto is nearing an end. Notably, President Biden announced that he wouldn’t veto the crypto market structure bill, FIT21, which the White House officially opposes – a pretty major concession.\n\nIt’s possible that all these events on the Hill acted like a temperature check, and helped convince Gensler that his approach to crypto was becoming a political hazard. Afterall, former President Donald Trump did just announce his support for crypto in a big way – and denying ETH ETFs on the basis, purportedly, that the SEC wasn’t having “productive” meetings with applicants would be great ammunition.\n\nTo be sure, the SEC didn’t approve ETH ETFs to actually list anytime soon – just the Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq’s 19b-4 proposals, which would allow them to list the funds once firms like Ark Invest, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others, get their S-1 filings approved. That could take months.\n\nWell first off, the launch of spot ETH funds means that there may soon be a lot more institutional interest in the second largest cryptocurrency. Not only did the move act as a sort of stamp of approval, it will also create a familiar on-ramp for buying the asset for anyone from mom and pop investors looking to diversify their 401(k)s to hedge funds, much in the same way ETFs did for bitcoin.\n\n“A lot of people have been caught offside by the Ethereum ETF announcement. Even though the Bitcoin ETF created a crypto ETF roadmap for wirehouses and large registered investment advisors, I still expect that many institutional stakeholders are now scrambling to prime their sales teams on the state of Ethereum and put together the proper infrastructure,” Framework Ventures co-founder Michael Anderson said in an emailed statement.\n\nAnd while ETFs are really just a vehicle for gaining exposure to an underlying asset, it is also possible that these funds will actually drive more users onto Ethereum itself. One scenario: because the SEC likely won’t allow fund managers to stake the underlying ETH, it’s possible new ether investors determine that they want to do it themselves to earn that extra ~3.5% yield.\n\nRelatedly, as Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted on X, the approval likely answers one lingering question: whether or not ETH is a security. Chervinsky said, if these funds are allowed to trade, it would likely mean that unstaked ETH, in particular, isn’t viewed as a security at the agency. That in itself may spur more institutions into the market, considering that many are currently holding off simply due to regulatory uncertainty.\n\nOn a more technical level, there are many open questions about what it would mean for Ethereum in a world where these funds buy up vast quantities of ETH (assuming they’re as popular) as the bitcoin ETFs. To some degree, the buying pressure would be great for the network and surrounding layer 2s.\n\nEthereum instituted a burn mechanism that destroys tokens with every transaction, which for a long time made the asset class deflationary. But, with the growing popularity of L2s and alternative chains like Solana, Ethereum transaction volumes have dropped to such a degree that the supply of ETH is growing again, which raises long term implications for the asset’s price and demand. The ETFs could help support the economics of ETH.\n\nSee also: Ethereum ETF Approval Could Spur 60% ETH Rally as\n\nFinally, it will be interesting to see how the funds affect the staking economy. Some people have been ringing alarm bells about the amount of staked ETH, now that applications like Lido make it very easy for people to lock up even tiny quantities of the crypto. With the possibility ETFs pull even more ETH out of circulation, these concerns may be compounded.\n\nAs mentioned, the approval of ETH ETFs is something of an endorsement for Ethereum, and likely an opportunity for the chain to lock in its already dominant brand position.\n\n“Assuming the Ethereum ETF sees even a fraction of the institutional flows that the Bitcoin ETF saw, I think it\u0027s entirely possible that Ethereum will be solidified as the uncontested leader in decentralized app platforms for the next several years, at least in terms of market share and valuation,” Anderson said.\n\nBut the move may also open the door for alternative chains like Cardano, Solana and Ripple to also enter further into the world of high finance. Of course, bitcoin and ETH had an easier time (all in perspective) because financial incumbents like CME had already embraced them. Ether futures have been live on CME for three years already, while it’s not even clear whether other crypto assets are being considered.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, while the SEC has hinted it thinks ETH is a security, the agency has proactively come out and said that assets like SOL, ADA and ALGO fit the definition outlined by the Howey Test used to determine whether something is an investment contract. This may be a speed-bump in the road towards a spot SOL ETF.\n\n",

First, the former president made pro-crypto comments earlier this month at a Mar-a-Lago dinner. Then this past Tuesday, Trump\u0027s presidential campaign began accepting crypto donations, making good on the presumptive Republican nominee\u0027s pledge to become the first major party candidate to embrace bitcoin, ether and other digital currencies.\n\nFollowing Trump\u0027s pro-crypto rhetoric and actions, the Biden administration\u0027s opposition to crypto as well as the attitude of the traditionally crypto-adverse Securities and Exchange Commission appear to have softened. Last Wednesday, the White House issued a statement expressing its opposition to the House of Representatives passing a crypto market structure bill, but Biden didn\u0027t threaten a veto. The House proceeded to approve the measure, which now heads to the Senate. Then on Thursday, the ether exchange traded funds (ETF) took a major step toward becoming available in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved key regulatory filings. Such an approval was seen as extremely unlikely just a month ago.\n\nRead more: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\n",

    "summary": "Here are some ways users and developers, the lifeblood of crypto, can help move better legislation through Congress, writes Rebecca Rettig, Chief Legal \u0026 Policy Officer at Polygon Labs.\n\nPolicy is a doing word. Engaging in policy work means talking, advocating, explaining, teaching, and, most importantly, building relationships.\n\nStorytelling matters. Being able to tell your story—whether as a developer or user — in a clear and straightforward way that addresses the direct impact of blockchain goes a long way.\n\nThe legislative process takes time.\n\n",
    "content": "If you told me when I got into the blockchain space more than seven years ago that key pieces of sweeping market structure legislation for crypto would be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, I wouldn’t have believed it.\n\nBack then, crypto was a nascent technology viewed as “niche” or “off the beaten path.” As a lawyer in private practice advising software developers building innovative, cutting edge technology, I worked exclusively behind the scenes on novel legal questions for this emerging sector.\n\nRebecca Rettig is a speaker at this year\u0027s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\nWe’re in a different world now. The concept of blockchain has greater cultural relevance than ever before, driven forward by evangelists and developers building on the margins.\n\nAdvocates see blockchain-based technology as transformative, with the ability to redefine not only how we engage in financial transactions, but also all internet-based interactions. Crypto brings the possibility of a new, decentralized internet to center stage in many ways, and global policymakers and regulators have trained their attention on what to do with this new industry like never before.\n\nPolicymakers and regulators are grappling with definitional and threshold questions of whether and how to regulate. What does it mean for a software system to be decentralized? When do potential financial risks emanate from cyber-security threats, and how do we mitigate such risks? What is necessary to ensure the overall integrity of the system?\n\nA huge shift is underway in helping educate lawmakers on how to answer these questions. The policy arm of the industry has focused and professionalized as rapidly as the technology has developed. This may make advocacy seem esoteric and removed for those who are actually building and using the technology. But the time for builders and users to get involved in educating and working with lawmakers is now. This is more true than ever after the passage of the first market structure bill for crypto passed the House yesterday with a bipartisan vote.\n\nAs builders in this space, you have unique knowledge and insights in how this technology works and why it is an unprecedented reorientation of what the internet can look like. Grassroots efforts play an essential role in advocating for crypto and I have heard time and again from members of Congress that you’re exactly who they want to hear from. The point of advocacy is to help regulators tap knowledge workers and enthusiasts who have the information that can help craft polity.\n\nSo how can you get started? There are a couple easy ways to engage.\n\nA number of organizations have been established specifically to give you the tools you need to advocate most effectively. Example? Crypto Policy Bootcamp.\n\nIn October 2023, Polygon Labs, Solana Foundation and DeFi Education Fund co-hosted the first Crypto Policy Bootcamp. The event brought together founders, CEOs, VCs, and other stakeholders to engage with policy experts, political advocates, and Congressional staffers and members of Congress. Discussions centered on how to talk about the value of blockchain technology. Through the various panels and accompanying dialogue, the bootcamp produced many takeaways, including:\n\nSince October, we’ve hosted four additional bootcamps alongside others in the industry including Wormhole Foundation and Ledger, with the fifth coming at the end of May at Consensus. And the stage is set for one of the strongest crypto advocates in Congress, Tom Emmer, to take time out to speak to Bootcamp attendees in Austin.\n\nThese bootcamps aim to make policy work accessible to anyone by equipping those building, investing, or working in the space with the tools and resources they need to effectively advocate for the evolution of the blockchain industry, ecosystem, and community on the Hill and beyond. And it is one of many fantastic ways to get the tools to get involved; there are organizations, such as Stand With Crypto, that are dedicated to this task, bringing builders together in D.C. and beyond to advocate.\n\nSpeaking directly to policymakers, especially your own Congressional representatives, has an unquestionably high impact.\n\nEven better when you can also tell your story. This can take many different forms: calling, writing letters, setting up meetings.\n\nThere are also a number of tools that aggregate stories and help educate lawmakers, which you can use to provide your own compelling testimony. Along with the community, Ihelped launch an open, interactive website, The Value Prop (TVP), which aggregates blockchain-based applications into a simple database. It showcases everything from community-built GPS and hotspot networks to tracking supply chains to online verification of digital records and information.\n\nThe effort took place over many months, with the enthusiastic community members submitting hundreds of use cases. As a result, TVP has become a mainstay of grassroots clarity for decision makers: policymakers and regulators use it as a resource.\n\nContributors from the crypto community like the Ethereum Foundation, Celo Foundation, and Mercy Corps Ventures, have elevated the site further. Now it features video testimonials of builders and founders discussing what they’re creating, why they’re doing it, and the impact of their work.\n\nWhat The Value Prop needs now more than ever are user testimonials. These testimonials bring to life the people actually using crypto, and the positive impact it’s made on their lives.\n\nTo that end, core team members of Polygon Labs will want to hear what you have to say! At Consensus on May 30, we’ll be interviewing users who want to testify about how they use this tech, why, and what it’s made of their life.\n\nYou — the builders and the users — are the lifeblood of the industry. You’re the most important voices that can be heard on policy issues.\n\nStart engaging.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be with trips to DC or even to your representatives office in your home state. You can engage from the busy Austin streets during Consensus, by filming a user testimony. Or any other myriad ways.\n\nYour time is now.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A year ago, “Crypto+AI” sounded like a game of “VC mad libs.” Now, as real-world applications begin to emerge, the idea makes much more sense. Jeff Wilser, who is hosting the AI Summit at Consensus 2024, offers a preview of the programming and reviews the decentralized AI state-of-play.\n\n",
    "content": "Almost exactly one year ago, I wrote a piece for CoinDesk called 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse). At the time, the idea of “Crypto + AI” was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent — at best — to the world of Web3. To others, “Crypto + AI” felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.\n\nFlash forward one year.\n\nDecentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects — maybe hundreds, it’s hard to keep track — are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk’s inaugural “AI Summit.” (I’ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I’ll be hosting on May 31.)\n\nSo why is this happening, and why does it matter?\n\nYou could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people’s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives — and that feels inevitable — it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?\n\nLet’s look at two concrete examples, one that’s straightforward and one that’s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (“Hey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S\u0026P.”)\n\nDo we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?\n\nMore chilling: It’s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots — perhaps through audio or even video — as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who’s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It’s coming. It’s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.\n\nThese are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make “AI compute” more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)\n\nWhile an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. “My initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in ’95 or ’96, when the internet became a thing,” Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. “It seemed to me, the internet shouldn’t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?” The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book “Creating Internet Intelligence” that fuses all these concepts.\n\nGoertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.\n\nGensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. “We’re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,” Gensyn’s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, “You don’t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.” (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)\n\nWhile many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.\n\nIn a Twitter/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but “without all the Orwellian stuff” and that “Venice doesn’t spy on you,” “Venice doesn’t censor your conversation,” and “Venice doesn’t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.” Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, “There are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.” Shots fired.\n\nVoorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there’s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter/X post explained that “Filecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.”\n\nOne reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there’s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn’t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren’t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.\n\n“The power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who’s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. “And greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.”\n\nNone of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it’s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The rise of Farcaster and portable “social graphs” will change the relationship between brand marketers and end-users, says the founder of JUMP, a network for Web3 branding executives.\n\n",
    "content": "Through each stepchange in technology, marketing has continually evolved. What started in the early days of Mesopotamia and Egypt, with merchants advertising their goods using symbols and signs on stalls, has become a complex global industry, constantly adapting to communications innovation.\n\nThis op-ed is part of CoinDesk\u0027s Web3 Marketing Week.\n\nWhen it comes to Web3, the latest innovation, Jeff Kauffman knows his stuff. Starting out early in the days of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, Kauffman built brand communities for clients like GameStop, Dr. Pepper and Chick-fil-A. He later founded JUMP, a network for branding executives curious about Web 3, which has drawn brand managers from at least 200 Fortune 500 companies.\n\n“With Web3, you now have this on-chain touchpoint relationship and experience and that’s the biggest difference, that there is this on-chain element to the end-user customer experience.” Kauffman, a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, believes the future direction of marketing lies in Web 3.0 social platforms, like Farcaster and portable social graphs, which offer unique experiences and put more control back into users\u0027 hands.\n\n“Take a look at what happened with the Starbucks loyalty program,” Jeff said. “While I commend the brand and the team for the effort, ultimately, they decided to shut it down. What did they get wrong? They tried to copy/paste their Web2 program and do it in a Web3 way. They tried to make it Web3, but it just didn\u0027t work.\n\n“Web2 is the best way to run that loyalty program. If you\u0027re going to enter Web3 and use tokens and start to interact with customers on-chain, whether it\u0027s under the umbrella of loyalty or not, you must think about a net-new experience with your customers.”\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Kauffman covered how marketing is changing with Web3, where it might go next, some examples of brands pushing the envelope and what makes for good marketing strategies with brands and creators.\n\nThe following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nCan you give me some examples of brands utilizing this offline to online to on-chain framework and pushing the envelope?\n\nKauffman: Two brands that are doing well are Coinbase and 9dcc, a fashion brand started by G-Money. 9dcc is a good example of a brand that truly understands this offline, online, and on-chain brand experience and customer experience. But I\u0027ll start with Coinbase. They\u0027ve done this cool thing as a publicly traded company where they\u0027ve released their earnings report as an NFT collectible for free. Anyone can mint it, and then those who did receive discounts to their merch store, and get exclusive perks, for example, access to limited edition hats that are only available to people who minted their earnings report. This shows the connection between offline, online, and on-chain. The offline component is the merchandise (the physical goods), the online component is the shopping experience of buying or securing the goods, and the on-chain element is minting their earnings report on-chain. And with the on-chain element, what\u0027s key is that brands are putting their story on-chain.\n\nWhat enabled this?\n\nKauffman: When Web3 became a term in 2020-2021, it was kind of all about, \"Hey, we\u0027ve got this collectible, and we want people to collect this thing, and we want you to buy it, and there\u0027s a limited supply.\" Now, the transition is less about this exclusive collectible and more about all these little components that make up a brand story, everything from an earnings report to the goods you produce. And the primary driver of this is Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nA few years ago, this kind of on-chain marketing and relationship with customers wasn\u0027t possible because everything was on Layer-1 Ethereum, gas costs were expensive, and they only got more expensive. This was the era of the 10,000 PFP collections in NFTs. The costs were such that you couldn\u0027t have a million or half a million people mint your earnings report; that just wasn\u0027t feasible. Having 500,000 to 1 million people engage with you on-chain only made sense when L2s came around- Base being one of the best examples of an L2 lowering transaction costs and allowing more opportunities for on-chain engagement.\n\nWhy is being on-chain so important for brands to utilize?\n\nKauffman: The most important aspect of on-chain marketing for brands is that it gives them a direct relationship with their customers. For consumers, they have more control of the relationship because they hold and control the tokens in their wallet.\n\nThis gives brands the ability to engage their customers within any on-chain enabled experience because the token is the link in the relationship. A couple of years ago this was more theory than reality. But, now with the rise of Web3 social, we’re seeing this play out in realtime. We’re not far from the day when an on-chain user experience on the internet is much better than the user experience with today’s internet. Cheaper fees and faster transaction costs on L2s are making this possible, which is driving new product and user experience designs that are only possible with the interoperability and composability of on-chain experiences.\n\nI also wanted to ask, through your work with JUMP, what do you see the ad executives often get wrong or misunderstand about Web3?\n\nKauffman: Many of the marketers in these institutions are intelligent and capable and understand a lot about the space. But they\u0027re in handcuffs because these legacy brands and institutions were built around different marketing laws of physics. In Web3, there\u0027s a different level of physics within the ecosystems, and legacy institutions can\u0027t get out of their own way.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, so instead of taking a cookie-cutter copy/paste approach, it needs to be more conscious and intentional?\n\nKauffman: A critical question to ask is “What do we do in Web3 that we couldn\u0027t do in Web2?” And it goes back to the other question, “Why blockchain?” If you keep pushing through a hundred of those scenarios, keep asking \"why blockchain\", and realize that you don\u0027t need blockchain or Web3 to do it, well, now you\u0027ve just iteratively gone through all of the ideas that you shouldn\u0027t have launched in the first place as a Web3 initiative. You eventually get to the thing where you\u0027re like, \"Ah, this can only be done with blockchain. Now, we can definitively answer the question, why blockchain and why Web3.”\n\nLet\u0027s circle back to Web3 social and how it\u0027s influencing the future of marketing.\n\nKauffman: Yeah, absolutely. So, the most dominant player right now is Farcaster. But Zora is very close and exciting, and then you have Lens. But if you could only spend your time in one place, it\u0027s Farcaster. So what\u0027s happening here is that this Web3 social network and Web3 social in general is bringing users and content on-chain. At a high level, other apps, experiences, and brands can then tap into the social graph facilitated through Farcaster and the content on these social networks to build new experiences.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\n\nKauffman: We can use Paragraph, which is a Web3 Substack. If you have a Farcaster account and you\u0027re active and you go to Paragraph and you create your Web3 substack or blog, you\u0027ll immediately be shown your farcaster social graph, and everyone you follow on Farcaster, their paragraph accounts will be shown to you and you can subscribe and follow them. This is something we thought would happen in Web2, but, because of the walled-garden nature and because of the privacy component, because users didn\u0027t own their content and identity in these social graphs, it became difficult to make this interoperable, portable social graph, of just network connections and people connections and the content itself as well.\n\nBecause you own your Farcaster ID, that sits in your wallet along with the content you produce, now it becomes portable. Now other brands and apps can launch and tap into that social graph and content graph. And immediately pull that in, which immediately creates this element of social graphs moving around the internet together in and out these different apps and continually being connected.\n\nSo, everytime I go to use a new app that is tapping into this Web3 social protocol, everytime I go to use a new app, that app has much more utility because I am immediately able to find the other people in my Farcaster social graph who are using this app and look at what they\u0027re doing on this new app that is tapping into what Farcaster has built.\n\nGive us a sense of the future.\n\nKauffman: Let\u0027s go to 2030. Elon Musk is landing on Mars, and there\u0027s this big ephemeral moment. You have hundreds of millions of people using Web3 social media, and you could, in theory, have an app that springs up that\u0027s really tailored to that moment, as well as content consumption and the conversation that is going on at that moment. A billion people use the app, and the moment the app goes away, the app goes away.\n\nSo, Web3 social, from a marketer\u0027s perspective, is the one area if you were to ask, \"Where I am going to spend my time as a marketer,\" I would say that I am going to spend my time with Web3 social. Spend your time there, use these protocols and Web3 social platforms, and join the communities there. The ROI for your exploration and time investment is a good bet.\n\n",

She was over 17 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday.\n\nThe softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n\n“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”\n\n“Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.\n\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n\n“Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”\n\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.\n\nHigher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.\n\nGill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\n\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\n\nCrypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n\n“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n\n“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.\n\nTHORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”\n\n“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\n\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n\n",

    "title": "CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The commodities regulator has been clear about the dangers of regulating a burgeoning industry through enforcement actions.\n\n",
    "content": "Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.\n\nIs it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?\n\nI think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled – whether it\u0027s an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority – we\u0027re seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It’s largely the lack of clarity that\u0027s really causing the tension.\n\nYou\u0027re in a minority position as a regulator who’s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you\u0027re willing to stick your neck out?\n\nPart of the reason I went into government, generally, is that – while there\u0027s a need for government in people\u0027s lives – we don\u0027t want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity – we\u0027ve made it very murky. That\u0027s not what the government should be doing. It’s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.\n\nI still think it\u0027s important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that\u0027s not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.\n\nDo you agree with Commissioner Pham’s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC\u0027s enforcement actions?\n\nCOMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It’s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it\u0027s that same kind of feeling that we shouldn\u0027t be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?\n\nI don\u0027t want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?\n\nThere are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.\n\nI\u0027m curious to what extent you\u0027re in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?\n\nThey use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It’s offering our assistance and expertise and it’s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we\u0027re able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it\u0027s impossible for the agency to implement then it’s useless.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?\n\nThere are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate – which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says “here\u0027s how to handle cryptocurrencies.”\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nBeyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That’s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There\u0027s no question that without statutory changes to ensure it\u0027s very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.\n\nI know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?\n\nWithout talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it\u0027s been whistleblower reports saying “I think somebody is violating the law.” It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don\u0027t think what they\u0027re doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We\u0027re kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.\n\nA lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There\u0027s also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it\u0027s the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there\u0027s opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they\u0027ll work together. It\u0027s more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it\u0027d be really difficult.\n\nNow one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it\u0027s a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else\u0027s money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we\u0027ve seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I\u0027d say every few years the theme changes – it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it\u0027s just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.\n\nI almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?\n\nI think when it\u0027s straight up fraud, yes. There\u0027s a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does – there\u0027s no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.\n\nBut where there\u0027s a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that\u0027s where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we\u0027re looking at a DeFi protocol, and we\u0027re saying they\u0027re violating our statute it can be difficult if we\u0027ve never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.\n\nWe’re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you\u0027ll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it\u0027s people who want to abide by the law, but there\u0027s no clear way how they would do that. That\u0027s why I think we\u0027d be better off with rulemaking.\n\nWhat do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?\n\nSo this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We\u0027ve [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we\u0027re not quite sure if there\u0027s clarity and that\u0027s dangerous.\n\nThe law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things – you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we\u0027ve said we believe this is a commodity and we\u0027re going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn\u0027t be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.\n\nGiven how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.’s FCA?\n\nI\u0027m always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you\u0027ve got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn\u0027t neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we\u0027re gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That\u0027s what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.\n\nWhy is the CFTC so against betting markets?\n\nIt\u0027s a very tough, difficult topic because there\u0027s a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it\u0027s relatively new, but we\u0027ve seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it\u0027s certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don\u0027t touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that\u0027s against federal law. There are a number of people who really don\u0027t like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.\n\nThen there\u0027s this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It\u0027s not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we’re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that\u0027s the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.\n\nSee also: \u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you\u0027re registered with us, you won’t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?\n\nYou know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven\u0027t had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There\u0027s a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don\u0027t have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn\u0027t. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they\u0027re following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that\u0027s what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone\u0027s following the rules.\n\nQuick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?\n\nI don\u0027t have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.\n\nWashington D.C.?\n\nYou know, I\u0027m gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.\n\nGary Gensler?\n\nNeutral. You know, I\u0027ve never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I\u0027ve had a chance to sit down and get to know them.\n\nThe phrase “sufficiently decentralized?”\n\nYou\u0027re either decentralized or you\u0027re not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don\u0027t know what that means. It probably means you\u0027re not decentralized.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nThe conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.\n\nThank you again for the time. Nice to meet you both.\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Radix—a layer-1 network that offers innovative upgrades to user and developer experiences in Web3 and DeFi—believes so. After a successful start to 2024, highlighted by a thriving ecosystem and growing TVL levels, Radix is gearing up for the next stage of its mass user onboarding strategy. Token Trek, built by dmany, aims to help onboard more users to the Radix community and increase network activity.\n\nThe world of decentralized finance has seen its share of ups and downs. While the potential for a more accessible, transparent and inclusive financial system is immense, adoption has been hindered by subpar user and developer experiences. To gain widespread acceptance, somebody must fix DeFi by addressing the major UX/DX roadblocks.\n\nRadix is stepping into the challenge by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure that benefits both users and developers.\n\nRadix gained momentum in late 2023 with their Babylon Mainnet upgrade. This set the stage for significant advancements within the ecosystem such as the new Radix Wallet and introducing Scrypto—an asset-oriented programming language to simplify developing secure, consumer-friendly dApps. The Babylon upgrade saw the“full-stack” approach Radix has taken with its platform, combining Scrypto with Radix Engine to pave the way for a more streamlined approach to building new DeFi applications. And the impact is already evident.\n\nIn March 2024, its Total Value Locked (TVL) skyrocketed from $30M to $53M in just 28 days, representing a 76% increase. This growth showcases the rising interest and confidence in Radix offerings as users eagerly adopt their platform for various DeFi primitives. This includes yield farming, staking and more.\n\nThis ongoing momentum has not gone unnoticed by industry experts. Recently, market research firm CryptoEQ positioned Radix alongside s other major smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. In its detailed comparative analysis, Radix emerged as the industry leader in user and developer experience. This recognition comes from various unique, native features, a focus on trust and reliability, and solutions to some of the most common UX hurdles in Web3.\n\nAnother key focus is interoperability. Recently, cross-chain liquidity DEX Maya Protocol announced its integration with Radix—approved through a vote by its community of node operators with a resounding 95% majority. Radix is not only enhancing cross-chain liquidity across major DeFi protocols, but also enabling trustless asset exchanges without compromising security. Such integrations will further open up a whole new world of opportunities for DeFi players: to grow and contribute to crucial metrics like TVL, weekly transactions and user acquisition.\n\nBut none of this is truly achievable without solid ecosystem support and strategic initiatives. Earlier, Radix launched its first $10 million liquidity booster,Project Ignition, to enhance the liquidity of wrapped USDC, USDT, wBTC and ETH. This initiative onboarded liquidity providers (LPs) to participate and have their provided liquidity matched with XRD (the token that powers the Radix ecosystem) on Ociswap, CaviarNine and DefiPlaza—effectively boosting liquidity by 2x. Through this, LPs can receive up to 20% of value upfront in XRD and earn trading fees while being protected from impermanent loss.\n\nThe benefits don’t stop there. Project Ignition also provides a 4x protection for asset outperformance. This means that LPs are protected if the crypto they provide outperforms XRD. For example, users can generate around 9% yield on their wBTC/XRD liquidity position plus 23% in SPLASH and reclaim any impermanent loss in XRD tokens.\n\nAs Radix gains traction, its wallet continues to dominate as a user-friendly gateway to its ecosystem. With over 35K downloads and growing, the Radix wallet claims that their truly human readable “transaction previews” mean that users can finally use DeFi with confidence. This focus on accessibility and ease of use is crucial for onboarding the next wave of DeFi adopters.\n\nEnter Radix’s newly unlocked growth phase with the launch of Token Trek. After first incentivizing developers and LPs, its next goal is incentivizing users. Developed by the Social Infrastructure startup Dmany, Token Trek will incentivize user interaction within the Radix ecosystem.\n\nDApps can integrate on-chain quests, making Radix a vibrant user onboarding and engagement hub. Rather than relying on superficial metrics, rewards are directed towards users who actively contribute to ecosystem growth. Such an approach supports the success of independent projects and strengthens their overall longevity and resilience.\n\nToken Trek allows for projects to allocate their marketing budgets effectively. By rewarding dedicated community members, projects stand a chance to benefit from a loyal and engaged user base. Projects can thus effectively optimize their marketing spend. This symbiotic relationship can potentially create a virtuous cycle of growth and value creation within communities.\n\nUsers will be rewarded for their gamified participation. Whether they try out new dApps, provide liquidity or engage in governance and decision-making, they can earn tokens and incentives. This approach is expected to attract a wide range of DeFi degens and crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAnd by providing a fun, rewarding and inclusive entry point into Web3, Token Trek can break down barriers and accelerate blockchain adoption.\n\nWith Token Trek\u0027s launch, users have an exciting opportunity to explore, “learn and earn” while contributing to the growth of a platform that puts them at the center. As the crypto industry emerges from another prolonged cyclical winter, gamifying community engagement is setting the stage for a breakout year with much wider adoption.\n\nWith Radix poised to attract a new wave of users and developers eager to explore the potential of DeFi, one thing is clear: The future of DeFi is looking brighter and more community-driven than ever.\n\nToken Trek\n\nRadix\n\nThe Radix Wallet\n\n",

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nThe SEC\u0027s approval of spot ether ETF regulatory filings has yet to spur a rally in crypto prices, which extended their slide during the Asian and European mornings. BTC has lost more than 3.4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $67,400 while ETH is down around 4.5% at $3,700. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), measuring the broader digital asset market, has lost over 3.3%. Ether ETFs are not yet cleared to trade, because the SEC still needs to approve their S-1 filings before investors can buy them. The approval came as a surprise to many. After clearing spot bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC didn\u0027t seem to engage much with issuers on ether ETFs, but that changed in recent days.\n\nBitcoin and ether both experienced wild swings in the run-up to the SEC\u0027s ETF decision on Thursday. ETH tumbled to $3,500 before surging to $3,900 as the first reports came through that approval of some filings was imminent. BTC, meanwhile, sank below $66,500, then spiked to $68,300 before settling just below $68,000. Liquidations across all leveraged crypto derivative positions soared to over $350 million during the day, the most since May 1, CoinGlass data shows. The bulk of the positions were longs betting on rising prices, worth roughly $250 million, suggesting that over-leveraged traders were caught off-guard by the sudden price plunge.\n\nKabosu, the Shiba Inu dog who inspired the dogecoin meme and thereafter the DOGE cryptocurrency, died at the age of 17.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\n\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\n\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\n\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\n\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\n\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\n\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\n\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\n\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\n\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\n\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\n\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\n\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\n\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\n\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\n\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\n\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n\n",

    "content": "Shiba Inu, known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” is eagerly anticipating a significant price leap. Market analyst Ashish has sparked excitement with a bold prediction: a 600% surge that could catapult the meme coin to an impressive $0.000075.\n\nThis bullish forecast comes after what Ashish describes as a nearly two-year-long slumber within a consolidation pattern. December 2023 saw Shiba Inu finally break free from this price purgatory, breaching a crucial resistance trendline. The breakout ignited a rally that culminated in a 370% surge, reaching a 2024 high of $0.000045 in early March.\n\nHowever, the party wasn’t meant to last. A correction ensued, prompting Ashish to establish strategic buying zones between $0.000022 and $0.000025.\n\n\n\nAshish’s crystal ball sees a bullish flag pattern emerging on the 1-hour chart, hinting at a potential “second leg up.” This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation following a sharp price increase, often acting as a precursor to another upward movement.\n\nDespite a slight price dip today, Shiba Inu appears to have room for growth. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at nearly 48, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral territory suggests potential for upward movement, aligning with Ashish’s prediction of a second leg up.\n\nMeanwhile, CoinCodex’s current Shiba Inu price prediction forecasts a rise of 220%, potentially reaching $0.00008089 by June 24, 2024. CoinCodex’s technical indicators currently show a Neutral sentiment, while the Fear \u0026 Greed Index stands at 76, indicating Extreme Greed. Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu has seen 12 out of 30 green days (40%) with a price volatility of 4.40%.\n\nGiven these metrics, it’s clear that Shiba Inu’s market behavior is capturing significant investor interest. The Extreme Greed reading on the Fear \u0026 Greed Index suggests a high level of enthusiasm, which, while positive for potential price gains, also warrants caution due to the possibility of rapid sentiment shifts.\n\nThe coin’s moderate volatility and the occurrence of green days indicate a steady, albeit unpredictable, upward momentum. This combination of factors makes Shiba Inu a fascinating asset to watch in the coming months.\n\nAs of today, the overall sentiment for the Shiba Inu price prediction is neutral. This assessment is supported by technical analysis indicators, where 20 indicators are showing bullish signals, while eight are signaling bearish trends.\n\nThis balanced sentiment reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. The fact that a significant number of indicators are bullish suggests there is optimism about Shiba Inu’s short-term potential, possibly driven by recent market activities or positive news.\n\nFeatured image from Top Gear, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by.\n\n",
    "content": "An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally.\n\nThe VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices.\n\nNormally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead.\n\nThe VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset.\n\nAs is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead.\n\nIn the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then.\n\nSince then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run.\n\nBased on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.”\n\nAs for how things could play out next, the analyst says,\n\nConsolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates.\n\nWoo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture.\n\nBTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst.\n\nBitcoin had recovered above $71,000 earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then, as it’s now back below $70,000.\n\n",

    "content": "The wider crypto market has seen a significant uptick in recent weeks, with some contenders gaining major momentum.\n\nThe most bullish area is the meme coin sector, which continues to grow and expand, offering the best opportunity to earn profits during the anticipated bull run.\n\nAs the crypto community prepares for it and looks for attractive investment opportunities, numerous industry experts are pointing towards these five tokens, believing they could explode in the weeks ahead.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at these hidden altcoin gems.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nHere’s a quick outline of the tokens we’ll be analyzing:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nNow, let’s examine each one to discover what makes them stand out in the market.\n\nDogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), an innovative meme coin, operates on a multi-chain framework that includes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Base, and Avalanche. This architecture improves efficiency, reduces transaction fees, and greatly improves the user experience.\n\nThe Dogeverse presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $15 million from early investors in just over a month. There are still opportunities to invest, with 15% of the tokens designated for the presale, 10% reserved for staking rewards, and 25% allocated for future projects.\n\n\n\nFollowing the presale, 5% of the tokens will be used for exchange listings, with 10% each allocated for liquidity and operational support.\n\nDogeverse plans to list on major platforms such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and offers staking options with APYs around 53%. Currently, $DOGEVERSE tokens are priced at $0.0003 each, but this rate is anticipated to soar right after the listing.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSealana ($SEAL) is a Solana-based meme coin featuring a seal character similar to the Gamer Guy from “South Park.” The presale has quickly gained traction, collecting over $2.2 million despite minimal social media presence, reflecting strong investor confidence in $SEAL.\n\n\n\nInvestors can buy Sealana through a widget on the project’s website or by sending SOL to a designated wallet, enabling direct participation in the presale and the potential for profits post-listing. During the presale, contributors receive 6,900 $SEAL tokens per SOL, following a model similar to Slothana, which raised $15 million in a short time.\n\nWith the hype around it growing, the crypto community is watching $SEAL closely, anticipating it will outperform the success of previous projects on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nWienerAI ($WAI) is an innovative AI-driven meme coin, created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This unique mix of AI technology and memes appeals to investors by securing transaction precision and security.\n\nWienerAI aims to reduce the usual fluctuations of meme coins by offering a staking mechanism with an APY of approximately 400%, promoting long-term holding and massive rewards. To date, over 2.6 billion tokens have been staked.\n\n\n\nCurrently priced at $0.0007, the presale has already raised over $2.5 million. Of the total 69 billion tokens, 30% are allocated for the presale, 20% for staking and community rewards, and 30% for future exchange listings and marketing efforts.\n\nAs the presale progresses, investors are suggested to participate early to benefit from the favorable price and high APYs.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) is the latest upgrade of the popular $SPONGE meme crypto token, which previously achieved a $100 million market cap and provided significant returns to early investors. A notable enhancement in $SPONGE V2 is a Play-to-Earn game inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nGiven the impressive growth of the original $SPONGE token, investors are optimistic about the potential success of Sponge V2 in the meme coin market.\n\n\n\nTo promote long-term investment, the project features a scheme where holders who lock their original Sponge V1 tokens for an extended period can earn impressive staking rewards in $SPONGE V2 tokens over four years. This strategy is designed to boost early adoption and maintain engagement.\n\nAs the presale nears its conclusion, investors are suggested to secure the remaining tokens before the listing.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nBonk (BONK) was introduced on the Solana network on Christmas 2023, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, Bonk provides faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum, which hosts many other meme coins.\n\nAlthough currently a meme coin, there are rumors that Bonk might venture into the DeFi and NFT sectors in the future, indicating potential growth beyond its present status.\n\nWith a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, Bonk’s scarcity could potentially impact its price dynamics. Over the past month, BONK has surged by 55.5%, and over the year, it has seen an astonishing increase of 7743%, making it a noteworthy investment opportunity.\n\nGiven the ongoing growth and appeal of the Solana ecosystem, Bonk could stand out in the anticipated bull run, attracting investors globally.\n\nAs the wider crypto market has experienced a surge in recent weeks, it’s obvious that the meme coins sector leads the way.\n\nNow, with the anticipated bull run on the horizon, investors are on the lookout for the next exploding tokens to add to their portfolios.\n\nMany industry experts suggest these five tokens, believing they could outperform major players in profits in the following weeks.\n\nThe great news is, you can still acquire them at affordable prices since most of them are still in the ICO stage.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Over some days, the price of Ethereum has been in a consolidation zone, moving between $3,949 and $3,627. This is a result of the rally that happened a few days ago which led to the crypto asset’s price making over 10% movement on the upside.\n\nWhen prices are consolidating, it can only be considered that it is building momentum to either break above the consolidation zone or below it. At this point, we cannot tell the next action the price will take.\n\nIn this article, we will see the possible outcome if there is a break out from the consolidation. As of the time of writing, the price of ETH was up by 0.66%, trading around $3,752 above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the last 24 hours.\n\nLooking at Ethereum’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe, it can observed that the price is trading above the 100-day moving average, suggesting ETH’s price is on a bullish trend and could break above the consolidation zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, with the help of the MACD indicator, although the MACD histograms are trending below the MACD zero line, these are already showing signs of weakness as the histogram color is becoming faint.\n\nThe MACD line and the MACD signal line are also seen moving toward the MACD zero line but as long as they are still above the zero line, there could be a possible reverser.\n\nWith this MACD formation, it could be suggested that the price of Ethereum is still bullish and there is a possibility it could break above the consolidation zone\n\nFinally, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also to analyze the price action in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the RSI line is attempting to back up after failing to cross below the 50 lines, suggesting that the price is still bullish.\n\n\n\nConclusively, if there is a break out above the consolidation zone, the price of ETH might continue to move upward toward the $4,094 resistance level. Should the price surpass this resistance level, it might move further upward to create a new high for the year.\n\nOn the contrary, if Ethereum breaks below the consolidation zone, the price might begin to move toward the $3,263 support level. A breakout below this level might cause a continuous downward movement toward the $2,864.04 support level.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Data of a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator could suggest $77,600 may be the level where the asset could see its next top.\n\n",
    "content": "Data from a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator suggests that $77,600 may be the level where the asset will see its next peak.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed what the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands model could suggest about the cryptocurrency’s future.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a popular on-chain indicator that compares the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The former is just the total valuation of the asset at the current spot price, while the latter is a model that calculates the asset’s cap by assuming the “true” value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain.\n\nThe previous transfer of any coin on the network was likely the last time it changed hands, and thus, the price at that time would be its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap keeps track of the sum of the cost basis of every investor in the market.\n\nTherefore, the MVRV ratio tells us how the value the investors hold (the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap).\n\nBased on this indicator, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has developed a pricing bands model. Below is a chart showing what these pricing bands look like.\n\nThe pricing bands in this model represent levels corresponding to a specific deviation from the mean for the MVRV ratio. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency is currently above the price level, corresponding to a +0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the mean for the indicator.\n\nMore specifically, the price level around $65,100 would be where the MVRV ratio would be +0.5 SD above its mean. The next major pricing band in this model is +1 SD, which currently corresponds to around $77,600.\n\nIn the past, this level has been where at least local tops have been probable to form for BTC. As is visible in the graph, the rally top back in March also occurred when BTC broke this level.\n\n“Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC top before a brief correction could be around $77,593!” notes the analyst.\n\nFrom the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, a potential rally to a new all-time high of $77,593 would mean an increase of more than 11% for the asset. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop from here and whether it will be able to maintain above the +0.5 SD MVRV level.\n\nSince its sharp surge earlier, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to have cooled off as the asset has fallen to sideways movement around the $69,700 mark.\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market.\n\nNaturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years:\n\n\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).\n\nThis would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run.\n\nWith the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark.\n\nIt would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin.\n\n\n\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise.\n\nThis is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH.\n\nBitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Two of the industry stalwarts, Fantom and Avalanche, have seen their values soar in recent weeks as altcoins season gets underway. Those who missed the opportunity are searching far and wide for their next chance, and many have come upon Raboo.\n\nRaboo is a brand-new cryptocurrency initial coin offering, currently in its presale phase. It has recently surpassed $1.4 million in sales, revealing its potential to change the meme coin culture tenfold. Analysts predict a 233% return for Raboo holders. Read on to find out why.\n\nIn recent weeks, Fantom (FTM) has become the talk of the cryptocurrency world thanks to its optimistic market increases. Fantom, known for its speed and scalability, has experienced a price surge. It increased from a low of $0.32 in mid-January and increased to $1.13 on March 23rd. However, it was unable to sustain that height and is now trading at $0.80.\n\nAnalysts claim that Fantom price rise isn’t the product of chance alone, but rather a result of strong whale activity and an increase in network interaction. They now have a strong interest in Fantom and have set a price objective for this year of about $1.60. There is a chance that the $1 resistance level could be retested soon.\n\nHowever, holders of the coin are not confident that Fantom price will stay bullish and have now looked to Raboo as a safe haven.\n\nJust like Fanto (FTM), Avalanche (AVAX) has surged in an optimistic environment. Avalanche’s AVAX token, which is well-known for its incredibly quick transaction times and extensive ecosystem, has been seeing notable weekly increases. Avalanche gave investors almost 100% returns in a matter of months, rising from $29.48 in January to and peaked at $60.69 by March.\n\nAvalanche price is now trading at $37.74 and has remained bullish for the past week. AVAX may reach or perhaps surpass $50 in the upcoming weeks if it maintains its bullish trend and breaks through the $45 resistance level. Sustained market interest and advantageous trade conditions are prerequisites for this scenario.\n\nRaboo the lighthearted yet powerful realm of meme coins, Raboo ($RABT) is swiftly rising to prominence as a cryptocurrency. What’s the buzz about? Raboo is a meme coin that combines humor and real financial potential.\n\nRaboo has already crushed the $1.4 Million funding milestone in Stage 3 of its presale, demonstrating the trust of the market and great investor demand. This accomplishment is proof of Raboo’s attractiveness and promise, not just a figure. Join the thriving community by buying the presale token for $0.0042. Purchasing an investment in Raboo entails joining a thriving community that is at the forefront of fusing income with fun.\n\nWith a total supply of 1.8 billion, analysts project a startling 100x increase on launch day and a 233% boost in the presale. This cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) has the potential to be the largest AI-powered meme coin of 2024, taking a sizable portion of the $62 billion meme coin market.\n\nFantom and Avalanche are both top coins in the crypto market, generating profit for their holders. While both Fantom and Avalanche are currently on a bullish trend, whether they will sustain the position is still in question. This has led them to seek safe haven in Raboo, the newest project in the market. Although it is yet to launch, Raboo is showing signs of potentially huge profits.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here.\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin spot ETF market continued its resurgence on one side, marked by a second consecutive week of positive inflows.\n\n",
    "content": "Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) have been the talk of the town – and rightly so – after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of the investment products during the week. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin spot ETF market continued its resurgence on one side, marked by a second consecutive week of positive inflows.\n\nThis streak of positive inflows represents a complete shift from previous weeks when investment activity was dangerously low. However, this recent turnaround reflects a rise in investor confidence over the past two weeks.\n\nOn Friday, May 24, the US Bitcoin spot ETF market saw another day of positive inflows, marking the 10th consecutive day of significant investment into these funds. According to data from SoSoValue, the market recorded a total net inflow of approximately $252 million to close the week.\n\nBreaking this down, BlackRock amassed a substantial percentage of the total daily investment, with the IBIT ETF posting an inflow of $182 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), on the other hand, did not attract any capital on Friday, ending the week with zero daily outflows and inflow.\n\nOther ETF issuers, such as Fidelity, Bitwise, and ARK Investment, also witnessed impressive inflows on Friday. Most notably, Fidelity’s FBTC came second to BlackRock’s fund after attracting about $43.7 million on the last day of the week.\n\nMore importantly, this positive inflow day means that the Bitcoin spot ETF market has amassed significant investment every day for the second week in a row. And after the close of Friday’s trading session, the net inflow in the past week stood at an impressive $1.06 billion.\n\nThis sustained positive trend in terms of capital inflow suggests that investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs might be back at an all-time high. The last time there was a consistent positive capital inflow into these products, the Bitcoin price rose to a new all-time high.\n\nWith Ethereum spot ETFs on the brink of trading in the US, crypto exchange-trade products seem to be in fashion at the moment. And they might just be the catalyst that the crypto market – particularly Bitcoin – needs to resume what is left of the bull cycle.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $68,868, reflecting a 2.5% price increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by 3% on the weekly timeframe.\n\n",

    "content": "In a week marked by consolidation across the cryptocurrency market, the native token of Uniswap, UNI, has defied the trend, surging over 15%, and surpassing the $10 mark. This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBeyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAnother fresh wallet withdrew 213,166 UNI($1.96M) from #Binance just now.https://t.co/u15CE864hm pic.twitter.com/kyOBv0TB5G\n\n— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 24, 2024\n\nThis flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI.\n\nThe token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend.\n\nThis on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential.\n\nThe recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day.\n\nThe majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price.\n\nThis display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak.\n\nThe SEC case against Uniswap remains unresolved, and a negative outcome could dampen investor sentiment. A broader market correction could still impact UNI’s price.\n\nFeatured image from Wallpapers, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors. However, crypto analyst Jelle has suggested that there is no need to be worried about the flagship crypto’s price action.\n\nJelle noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still following a “similar path” to the 2017 bull run. He claimed that once the crypto token breaks again above the 2021 all-time high ($69,000), it will make a parabolic move to the upside. Jelle predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 when that happens.\n\nIn an earlier X post, Jelle provided insights into why Bitcoin could easily make such a move. He revealed that all key resistance levels have been broken. He also noted that a weekly hidden bullish divergence had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, just on top of the previous cycle highs.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Mags also echoed Jelle’s bullish sentiment. In an X post, he mentioned that this recent price correction was the “fakeout before the next leg up.” Mags noted how Bitcoin has maintained a similar pattern since its price bottomed at $15,000, with the flagship crypto consolidating inside a range for “a few weeks or months.”\n\nMags claims that Bitcoin then breaks below the range where it traps all bears before making a “quick reclaim and another leg up.” The analyst added that there is going to be a “massive leg up soon” if Bitcoin manages to repeat this pattern.\n\nCrypto analyst BitQuant also assured there was no need to panic about Bitcoin’s recent dip. In an X post, he claimed that the price dip was a “good confirmation” that Bitcoin is preparing for a “big leg up.” The crypto analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $95,000 when this parabolic move happens.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin’s outlook is bullish regardless of what happens. He outlined two possible moves the flagship crypto could make from here. First, he stated that a weekly candle close above $71,500 would likely kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range.\n\nOn the other hand, he noted that history suggests that Bitcoin will consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for some weeks more. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still bound to make significant moves to the upside, and all that matters is the timing. The analyst noted that a breakout now could mean Bitcoin would have an accelerated cycle.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for some more weeks, that will help it resynchronize with past halving cycles, resulting in a longer bull run.\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst explained how Bitcoin’s availability for trading has quietly declined during the asset’s recent consolidation phase.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discusses the recent trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms.\n\nThe chart below shows how the spot and paper BTC reserves have changed over the past few years.\n\nAs the graph shows, the Bitcoin sitting in spot wallets has been declining over the last couple of months. The total amount of such BTC in the custody of central entities has now dropped to just 2.3 million.\n\nIt’s also apparent that the total sum of the spot and “paper” BTC (highlighted in purple) has declined at the same time. Paper BTC here refers to derivatives products related to cryptocurrency that don’t actually require investors to own the asset.\n\nThus, given that the combined sum of the exchange inventory has gone down for the cryptocurrency, it would appear that the decrease in the spot BTC isn’t because paper BTC has replaced it.\n\nGenerally, the supply of exchanges is considered part of the Bitcoin supply, which is “available” for trading. As such, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, less of this available supply may be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFrom the graph, it’s visible that this decline in the exchange inventory has come during a period where the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled after setting a new all-time high (ATH). As Woo notes,\n\nWhile everyone was freaking out that Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place.\n\nThus, the fact that the available supply has gone down during such a period could be a bullish sign for the coin. “It’s only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time highs,” says the analyst.\n\nIn another X post, Woo also discussed how capital inflows into Bitcoin have just started to pick up again after registering a steep drop earlier.\n\nAs the chart shows, network inflows spiked alongside the all-time high, but they observed a major slowdown in the consolidation that followed.\n\nThe inflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighted in light green, also disappeared earlier, but they have now made a comeback alongside these fresh capital inflows.\n\nBitcoin had recovered as high as $71,000 earlier but appears to have slipped off over the last few days as it has now returned below the $68,000 level.\n\n",

    "content": "CORE, the native token of the layer-1 network CoreChain, has surged over 20% in the last 24 hours. This is a notable price increase, considering the downward trend in the broader crypto market with the prices of other major cap tokens, including Ethereum (ETH) dumping.\n\nCORE’s price rallied by over 20% following crypto exchange Coinbase’s decision to add the crypto token to its listing ‘Roadmap.’ That means the foremost US crypto exchange plans to list CORE at some point, although it hasn’t disclosed exactly when that will happen. Regardless, this is undoubtedly a positive development for the CORE ecosystem, given the exposure and mass adoption it could gain from being listed on Coinbase.\n\nCORE runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-1 blockchain CoreChain. The network is unique because it adopts a ‘Satoshi Plus’ consensus mechanism. This mechanism adopts Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) and Ethereum’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism to address the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security.\n\nCORE has already had quite a year, considering it is one of the best-performing crypto assets among the top 100 coins by market cap, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 265%. This feat is more commendable given that only three crypto tokens (Dogwifhat, PEPE, and Arweave) in the top 50 rankings have made more YTD gains than CORE.\n\nInterestingly, most of CORE’s price gains came in the weeks leading up to the Bitcoin halving, with the crypto’s price skyrocketing by over 220% in a single week. CORE’s interoperability with Bitcoin also gives it an edge, with the network launching ‘CoreBTC,’ which allows users to bridge their BTC tokens to the network, thereby tapping into the liquidity on the flagship network, Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase’s decision to add CORE to its list listing roadmap follows its recent listing of XRP and BONK for its New York customers. The crypto exchange’s decision to relist XRP undoubtedly raised eyebrows, considering it had delisted the crypto token in 2021, shortly after the legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple began.\n\nMeanwhile, BONK’s listing has caused many in the crypto community to question when the crypto exchange will also list meme coins, Dogwifhat, and PEPE. Coinbase’s hesitation to list these two meme coins continues to be a surprise, given that they are the fourth and third largest meme coins by market cap, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase International Exchange also recently announced that it will add support for Bonk, FLOKI, and Shiba Inu perpetual futures on its platform and Coinbase Advanced. The platform added that trading will officially begin on May 30th. Coinbase Derivatives also recently launched futures contracts for the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin.\n\nFeatured image from NBC News, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum appear to currently be the center of attention in the crypto market so far, with Bitcoin recently hitting just above a 24-hour high of $71,650 mark, marking a 6.4% increase in the past 24 hours and nearly 20% over the past week.\n\nA prominent Crypto Analyst who has since been tracking Bitcoin’s movements has recently revealed insights into the asset’s latest trends, signaling a notable move ahead for BTC.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current “Re-Accumulation Range.”\n\nHowever, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory.\n\n#BTC\n\nA Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range\n\nHowever, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more\n\nExtended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to… pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024\n\nThis extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency “resynchronize” with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted:\n\nAfter all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs)\n\nThe analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range.\n\nMeanwhile, another analyst, TechDev, recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential future trajectory, drawing parallels between the current market actions and those of the 2017 bull run.\n\nBack then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017.\n\nSupporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path.\n\n#BTC\n\nEven $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024\n\nNotably, the surge in Bitcoin’s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nData from Farside indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced their most substantial inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively achieving $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17.\n\nNotably, about 89% of these inflows occurred in the last three trading days of the week, following a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin whales are not backing down from the market and have continued to capitalize on the pump by buying every dip. The most recent dip toward $60,000 saw these large investors gobble up BTC at an alarming rate, with their daily spending coming in at billions of dollars.\n\nIn a stunning discovery, co-founder of Bitcoin-based company Apollo, Thomas Fahrer, revealed that Bitcoin whales have been rapidly buying up the tokens amid price drawdown. More specifically, the daily spend of these whales caught Fahrer’s eye.\n\nThe report shared by the founder shows that while smaller investors had been selling, Bitcoin whales were buying up billions of dollars worth of coins. In the 24-hour period, these whales holding more than 1,000 BTC on their balances accumulated 8,953 BTC, worth $6.3 billion at the time. This further adds to their weekly accumulation numbers, coming out at 12,058 BTC, which is almost $9 billion worth of BTC bought in one week.\n\nWhales accumulated $6.3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin Yesterday.\n\nSo c’mon now, fess up. Who’s selling? pic.twitter.com/3dLD2BI89L\n\n— Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) May 22, 2024\n\nThis accumulation trend comes in light of smaller investors selling their tokens. For example, Fahrer’s screenshot show Sharks, which are investors holding between 100-1,000 BTC on their balances sold 6,746 BTC in one day, worth around $5 billion.\n\nOther notable sellers include the crabs, which are investors holding 1-10 BTC, selling 1,074 BTC in the same time period. Shrimps – investors holding 0-1 BTC, were also caught selling, with a total of 591 BTC sold. While Fish investors, those holding 10-100 BTC, sold only 95 BTC in the one day period.\n\nThe flow of these investors shows that BTC is flowing out from smaller investors toward larger investors, something that is bullish for the price. The same is the case on the weekly timeframe where Shrimps sold 2,079 BTC, Crabs sold 5,748 BTC, Fish sold 1,155 BTC, while Sharks bought up 60 BTC, with Bitcoin whales buying the majority with 12,085 BTC.\n\nA number of crypto analysts have called for buying and it seems Bitcoin whales are the ones following this advice. One of the analysts who has been vocal about it being the time to buy is Ali Martinez, who shared an interesting formation on the Bitcoin chart.\n\nMartinez pointed out that the TD Sequential, which had previously predicted the Bitcoin price movement, had flashed a buy signal. The level at which this analyst presented this buy signal was around the $69,500 level, and since then, the BTC price has since rebounded above $70,000, suggesting the buy signal was correct.\n\nThe TD Sequential has accurately predicted #Bitcoin price action on the one-hour chart. Now, it presents a buy signal, anticipating $BTC will rebound! pic.twitter.com/6ImRkREPVW\n\n— Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024\n\nIf the TD Sequential holds like it did the last time it appeared, then the current price push could see Bitcoin reach a new all-time high above $74,000, since the last one saw an almost 15% move. But for now, Bitcoin bulls are fighting to maintain its position above $70,000, with a 12.22% increase in the last week.\n\n",

    "content": "Solana (SOL) defied a slight market dip today, maintaining key support levels and sparking renewed optimism among investors. The altcoin boasts a healthy 24-hour trading volume of $6.50 billion, solidifying its position among the top cryptocurrencies. Market dominance for SOL sits at 3.04%.\n\nProminent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade isn’t shying away from bold predictions. In a recent analysis, Tardigrade expressed a highly optimistic view of Solana’s future price trajectory. According to the analyst, SOL, currently trading at $170, has successfully broken free from its recent consolidation pattern, signifying a bullish charge towards a staggering $1,000 mark.\n\nMacro structure $SOL 🔥#Solana has broken out the 2nd triangle from the recent bottom and is heading to $1000 🚀 Have you heard about #socialfi on #Solana? Interesting that you can now share images to your friends through blockchain with private messages (wallet👛 to wallet👛)… pic.twitter.com/yoSnLK9dSs\n\n— Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 23, 2024\n\nBeyond price predictions, Tardigrade emphasized the exciting developments brewing within the Solana ecosystem. One such development is the rise of SocialFi applications, a new wave of social media platforms built on blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nWhile short-term price fluctuations saw a 4.50% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 1.30% decline over the past week, the overall outlook for SOL remains upbeat. Market observers are particularly enthusiastic about both the immediate and long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe recent green light for the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF is expected to have a ripple effect, positively impacting the entire altcoin market, including Solana. This market-wide bullish sentiment could propel SOL prices even higher.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF’s approval not only signifies increased institutional trust in the cryptocurrency market but also paves the way for other blockchain projects to gain mainstream attention. As more investors become comfortable with cryptocurrency investments through regulated financial products, altcoins like Solana are poised to benefit from increased liquidity and wider adoption.\n\nAt its all-time high of $259 on November 6, 2021, Solana reached its highest price; at its all-time low of $ 0.503701 on May 11, 2020, it recorded its lowest price.\n\nSince its ATH, the lowest price was $8.00. Since the previous cycle low, the highest SOL price was $207. Right now, there is optimistic emotion with the Solana price projection, and the Fear \u0026 Greed Index is showing 76 (Extreme Greed).\n\nFeatured image from Space.com, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin price has cooled off after surging to as high as $71,000 on the back of the Ethereum ETF approval news last week.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price has cooled off after surging to as high as $71,000 on the back of the Ethereum ETF approval news last week. Not long after the price spike, the premier cryptocurrency witnessed a correction to $67,000 and appears to be back in a consolidation range.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin whales seem to be awakening from their slumber, as they have been loading their bags with significant BTC amounts in the past few days. This begs the question – can the returning whales’ appetite push Bitcoin to a new record-high price?\n\nA pseudonymous analyst shared in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post that Bitcoin whales are showing an increased buying appetite and getting active in the market once again. The relevant indicators here are the total whale holdings and a moving average tracking a 30-day percentage change in the balance.\n\nWhales are entities (individuals or organizations) that own substantial amounts of a cryptocurrency (typically at least 1,000 BTC, in this case). Due to the size of their holdings, whales are often able to influence price movements and market dynamics through their activities.\n\nIn the Quicktake post, the on-chain analyst noted a recent increase in the monthly percentage change in whale address holdings and a steady rise in the total whale balance. The pseundonymous pundit said:\n\nThe whales’ appetite for buying Bitcoin has returned strongly, after a two-month decline in buying interest since March.\n\nFrom the chart above, it was observed that the Bitcoin whales had increased their holdings by more than 11% in March when the BTC price hit a new all-time high of $73,737. However, the BTC accumulation rate steadied in April, with the 30-day percentage change falling to around 3% by the end of the month.\n\nBitcoin accumulation appears to be on the rise in May, with the monthly percentage change returning to above 5% as of May 24. The CryptoQuant analyst said in the post:\n\nThey [whales] are now returning with a strong buying force again, indicating that the current prices are suitable for purchasing and accumulating despite the widespread fear.\n\nIf the whale accumulation of BTC returns to its March level, there is an increased likelihood of the Bitcoin price returning to and perhaps surpassing its current all-time high. This projection is even more plausible considering that the premier cryptocurrency did forge a new high the last time the whales accumulated BTC at that rate.\n\nAs of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $69,216, reflecting a bare 0.8% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly.\n\nThis prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets.\n\nThe firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers.\n\nIn a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.”\n\nSubstantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs.\n\nThe optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence.\n\nFidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow.\n\nYesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi\n\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024\n\nFurther underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC.\n\nOther hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nQCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook.\n\nThe positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation.\n\nThis is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields.\n\nJames Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements.\n\nAccording to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system.\n\nHe noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.”\n\nCoutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "As Bitcoin navigates through significant price changes, varying analyses from crypto analysts have painted a diverse picture of its short-term trajectory.\n\nA prominent crypto analyst, Ali, identified a sell signal on Bitcoin’s short-term charts using the TD Sequential indicator.\n\nAccording to Ali’s analysis, the TD Sequential indicator suggested that Bitcoin’s current uptrend might be losing momentum. This could potentially lead to a correction over the next one to four candlesticks, particularly noticeable on the four-hour chart.\n\nThe TD Sequential presents a sell signal on the #Bitcoin 4-hour chart, anticipating a one to four candlesticks correction for $BTC. pic.twitter.com/OC9Clv0Tat\n\n— Ali (@ali_charts) May 16, 2024\n\nContrasting this perspective, another prominent analyst, Rekt Capital, recently provided a more optimistic view. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin ended its downtrend in mid-April, breaking into an uptrend with its price surpassing previous resistance levels.\n\nThis change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors.\n\nThe TD Sequential indicator’s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592.\n\nRekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum. He remarked that the recent breakout to $66,000 is a testament to how quickly market sentiment can shift toward a bullish trend.\n\nThe analyst disclosed:\n\nThe Bitcoin Bull Market is not over. But time and time again, the market will try to shake you out of your positions before you are able to profit significantly from them.\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital commented on the broader market trends, noting that the crypto sector is at a critical juncture where narratives are evolving, and the market landscape could change rapidly, especially with impending regulatory developments in the US.\n\nMike Novogratz further expanded on the macro view, suggesting that the next few months could be pivotal for the crypto market as it responds to new narratives and regulatory developments.\n\nIt’s been a fascinating week in crypto. Narratives are forming and odds are shifting. It’ll be interesting to watch the next few months play out, and even more interesting to watch the jump shift that’ll occur as soon as there’s regulatory clarity around crypto in the U.S.… pic.twitter.com/t0g5rTIKjP\n\n— Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) May 16, 2024\n\nHe also recently predicted that Bitcoin’s price will oscillate between $55,000 and $75,000 for some time, indicating a phase of consolidation before any major moves.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns.\n\n",
    "content": "A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns that suggest a price rally above $80,000 in this market cycle.\n\nIn a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CrediBullCrypto’ has doubled down on his previous prediction of an ultra-bull scenario for Bitcoin in the future. The analyst’s insights on Bitcoin’s recent activities suggest that the downside risk may be less significant than previously anticipated, paving a bullish path for a massive upside for Bitcoin.\n\nSharing a graphical chart of Bitcoin’s price actions from April to May 2024 in a YouTube video, Credibull Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rising above $100,000 in this projected ultra-bull scenario. The focal point of his analysis was based on the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAccording to the crypto analyst, Open Interest has reached 78,000 BTC, significantly higher than its baseline of 64,000 BTC. CrediBull Crypto revealed that this current Open Interest was in a danger zone. This is because the 14,000 BTC difference typically indicates elevated market activities, which often precede volatile price movements.\n\nAdditionally, the CrediBull Crypto revealed that a single unidentified Bitcoin whale was responsible for approximately 10,000 BTC of the increased 14,000 BTC Open Interest. This means that the anonymous whale controls 70% of all the added Open Interest on Binance perpetual futures since the baseline.\n\nHe also disclosed that in the scenario where the anonymous whale can withstand 10% to 15% downward pressure without liquidating their assets, the actual available Open Interest that would be vulnerable to a decline would be only 4,000 BTC, instead of the initial 14,000 BTC addition. The analyst revealed that out of the 4,000 BTC, some would be directional shorts, noting that the net long positions at risk would be even lower.\n\nGiven this theory, CrediBull Crypto argued that the potential for a downside is more limited. As a result, the ultra bull scenario where Bitcoin’s price surges to new all-time highs was worth considering.\n\nIn his YouTube video, CrediBull Crypto also highlighted a potential retracement slightly above the $60,000 price mark. The analyst predicted a bearish scenario, where Bitcoin could see its price falling significantly towards $62,000 to $63,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $69,774, reflecting a 0.08% decrease in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. CrediBull Crypto disclosed that Bitcoin had failed to break through key resistance levels above $70,000.\n\nHe predicts that consistent declines and liquidations could potentially trigger a bottom below $60,000. However, he also revealed that such a bearish turnaround was highly unlikely at this time, as Bitcoin’s price movements currently indicates an ultra bullish scenario.\n\n",

Despite the Fear \u0026 Greed Index hovering in “extreme fear” territory, most technical indicators point towards a sustained uptrend.

The overall optimistic outlook is bolstered by LINK’s impressive performance in the past month, with a price appreciation of over 16%.\n\nMeanwhile, this week’s bullish fluctuations in whale activity on Chainlink are another important sign that shows how popular LINK and other Ethereum-hosted cryptocurrency projects are among investors.\n\nThe Santiment graphic above displays changes in the balances of LINK tokens held by the top 100 largest wallets in real time.\n\nAs of May 19, the top 100 Chainlink investors held 701 million LINK tokens.

Crypto analyst The Signalyst highlights this in their latest Bitcoin analysis where they identified that the BTC price is at a ‘make or break zone.’\n\nAs The Signalyst points out, Bitcoin had been able to break above the accumulation level between $60,000 and $62,000, which had allowed investors to get in. Despite its decline in the last day, the price has maintained its position in the upper bound of this range.\n\nFor the bullish scenario to continuation, the crypto analyst explains that BTC must go ahead to break the upper bound of this range completely, which is the $72,000. This is the major resistance for bulls. If this happens, then The Signalyst believe that the Bitcoin price will move toward the next major resistance at $80,000.\n\nSimilarly the to bullish scenario, the bearish scenario for Bitcoin could possibility play out at this level. As the The Signalyst points out, even though the price is currently still in the upper bound of the range, it risks being brought down by bears.\n\nIn this case, the level to watch is the lower trend line, which currently sits around $62,000. Much like the resistance at $72,000, the support at $62,000 is what bears must break to pull the price further down. If this scenario were to play out and the bears successfully broke the lower trend line, then the analyst’s chart shows that the Bitcoin price could fall as low as $56,000. This would mean an over 20% decline from its current price.\n\nBTC Price\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin price is still seeing some bullish momentum, with its daily trading volume rising over 40% in the last 24 hours alone. This suggests that investors are still actively engaging with the cryptocurrency, something that could drive the price higher.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $67,300, with a 3.29% loss in the last day, but still holding small gains of 1.68% on the weekly chart.\n\n",

    "content": "Meme coin market started as internet jokes and digital playthings and now is the fastest-growing branch within the crypto world. As of today, the market cap stands at $62 billion with a total of 755 coins, making it an inevitable part of every investor’s journey.\n\nMany traders have made their biggest returns investing in meme coins. Bonk and Pepe have had more than a 25% rise in value in this week alone. Also, Dogecoin had decent surges with a solid 5% price increase.\n\nAll this indicates that the future is in meme coins and it comes as no surprise that the top market analysts suggest looking into projects like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sponge V2.\n\nLet’s see below what they’re all about.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nFirst, let’s learn the basics of each coin.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nNow, let’s check out the details.\n\nDogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is the first coin to leverage multiple blockchain interoperability, operating across Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Base, and Solana. These blockchains collectively enhance Dogeverse’s speed, cost-efficiency, and overall effectiveness.\n\n\n\nLeading the project is Cosmo, a chain-hopping doge, whose design aims to capitalize on the popularity of similar dog-oriented projects.\n\nThe presale has been a tremendous success, raising over $15 million, which has generated substantial buzz and excitement. With this achievement, Dogeverse is entering its final phase. Priced at just $0.0031 per $DOGEVERSE, it presents a phenomenal opportunity for those looking to get involved in the next big cryptocurrency trend.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSealana ($SEAL) is a chubby seal who has dived deep into the Solana Sea. Once fit, he’s now glued to his PC, growing larger each day on a diet of chips and canned tuna. His obsession with finding the best Solana meme coins keeps him constantly busy.\n\nInspired by the South Park World of Warcraft guy, Sealana is the latest SOL meme coin, launching with a ‘Send to Wallet’ style presale. Rumor has it that the creators of the viral\n\nSLERF token, which saw huge gains in March 2024, are behind Sealana.\n\n\n\nUsers can purchase $SEAL either through the website widget or by sending SOL directly to the presale wallet.\n\nThe project has already seen significant success, raising over $2.5 million. Currently, one $SEAL costs $0.022, but this price will increase as the presale progresses, so early participation is recommended.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nWienerAI ($WAI) is a new dog-themed meme coin following in the footsteps of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Myro. Right now, you can buy WienerAI in a token presale that’s happening in stages, with each stage having a slightly higher token price.\n\n\n\nYou need to connect your Ethereum wallet to the presale site and use ETH or USDT to make your purchase. Once you have $WAI tokens, you can start staking them right away to earn rewards. Keep in mind, though, that as more tokens are staked, the rewards might decrease.\n\nRight now you can get 1 $WAI for $0.000709 and that price is going to change really fast because $80k more is needed for the next phase to start. As of now, the project raised $2.6 million and that number is going to rise even more in the future.\n\nAfter the presale ends, WienerAI plans to launch a new AI trading bot for crypto, further making it stand out from the sea of Doge-related meme coins.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy WienerAI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSponge V2 ($SPONGE) is an enhanced and upgraded version of the V1. This revamped version aims to build on the success of the original, which saw a remarkable 100x price surge and reached a $100 million market cap.\n\n\n\nTo obtain V2 tokens, investors must bridge them from their existing V1 holdings. Those willing to stake and permanently lock their V1 tokens stand to receive a substantial reward – four years of staking rewards paid in $SPONGE V2. This incentivizes early adoption of the new token.\n\nOne of the main objectives is securing listings on major exchanges like Binance and OKX. Such listings could significantly amplify $SPONGE V2’s visibility and adoption, potentially reigniting the token’s momentum and driving its valuation beyond the $100 million mark once again. Right now the project has staked and bridged around $22 million.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sponge V2 Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nMemereum ($MEME) is a new crypto project that offers blockchain insurance to protect crypto assets and fiat currencies from inflation. It’s also launching a decentralized exchange for token swaps.\n\nIn the presale phase, over 16 million tokens have been sold, indicating high investor interest. Tokens are available for purchase on the BNB Smart Chain at $0.035 each. The first Memereum NFT will be free for users holding $250 or more in $MEME tokens.\n\nBy mid-2024, Memereum plans to launch its app and NFT collection, followed by a crypto lending platform and a Memereum Visa Debit Card by August 2024.\n\nMemereum’s diverse offerings and growth potential make it an exciting project in the crypto space.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nMeme coin market has always sparked interest and debates among investors and the recent market cap milestone confirmed that the hype is well worth it.\n\nThis meteoric rise isn’t just about funny memes and viral moments—it’s a testament to the power of social media, the thrill of speculation, and the strong sense of community-driving meme tokens.\n\nThat’s why numerous industry sources are pointing out that the potential for the biggest returns lies in the meme coin presales, specifically Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), WienerAI ($WAI) and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE).\n\nAll these coins have strong community backing, straightforward tokenomics, and big hype surrounding them so make sure to get them while they’re cheap!\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Tokens like Jupiter and NEAR have historically delivered substantial returns to investors through features like optimal liquidity and robust network security. However, Raboo ($RABT), a new presale token in the meme ecosystem, has swiftly gained traction among investors with purchases now exceeding the $1 million mark.\n\nRaboo’s emergence has continued to inspire market frenzy, with the token being tipped as one of the best cryptos to invest in by several analysts. But amidst the dominance of Jupiter and NEAR, can Raboo emerge as the best altcoin to buy in 2024? Let’s find out!\n\nThis month, Jupiter unveiled its ambitious “Grand Unified Markets” initiative, signaling a significant expansion in its market offerings. The initiative which aims to integrate “all assets” onto the Solana blockchain and index them within the Jupiter ecosystem positions Jupiter to soar this month and solidifies its ranking as one of the best altcoins to invest in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Jupiter has also partnered with market makers and real-world assets projects, laying the groundwork for the inclusion of forex, stocks, and real-world assets alongside cryptocurrencies. In collaboration with these partners, Jupiter will work towards creating liquid markets for a wider range of assets on Solana, enhancing the platform’s scope and accessibility.\n\nJupiter’s evolution from a DeFi app to a comprehensive platform for asset tokenization reflects a growing trend in both the crypto and traditional finance sectors. Jupiter aims to become a pioneering venue for tokenization on a large scale by facilitating the efficient swapping and movement of tokenized assets. This move will ultimately position Jupiter for more growth this month.\n\nThis month, Mercuryo, a global payments infrastructure provider, announced the integration of its on-ramp solutions into Meteor Wallet, which is the interface for managing digital tokens and accessing DeFi services and decentralized applications (dApps) on the NEAR blockchain.\n\nThis integration will further bolster accessibility of the Near token, as Meteor Wallet now allows users to seamlessly purchase digital assets using credit and debit cards or Apple Pay. This integration has spurred a 14.50% growth in NEAR’s trading activity this month, further demonstrating to investors that it is one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024.\n\nNEAR Protocol has also previously demonstrated impressive growth, with its token surging by 54% in late December alone, contributing to a remarkable yearly gain of 412%. This surge is attributed to heightened on-chain activity and sustained interest, showcasing NEAR’s resilience and attractiveness to investors despite market fluctuations.\n\nExperts have predicted a remarkable 10x surge for Raboo, the new AI-powered token currently making waves in the crypto industry. This forecast signals a paradigm shift in meme-driven cryptocurrencies and fuels excitement among crypto enthusiasts towards Raboo ($RABT).\n\nWith its innovative fusion of cutting-edge technology and precise AI integration, Raboo emerges as a frontrunner in the industry, offering investors a groundbreaking opportunity to shape the future of meme culture.\n\nAlready being tipped as one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, Raboo’s tokenomics not only incentivize early participation but also foster community engagement, setting a new standard for meme-driven coins. Its revolutionary approach aims to redefine the meme industry through technology, promising unparalleled benefits for token holders and reshaping the landscape of digital entertainment.\n\nAs analysts project a staggering 233% growth during the presale and a potential 100x surge on launch day, Raboo is poised to connect meme enthusiasts worldwide, fostering a vibrant community and offering exciting opportunities for monetizing social media content through its innovative Post-to-Earn platform.\n\nAlthough Jupiter and NEAR have demonstrated significant growth and garnered widespread attention within their respective niches, Raboo has emerged as a compelling investment opportunity, poised to disrupt the meme-driven coin market with its innovative features.\n\nWith a forecast predicting a remarkable 10x surge for Raboo’s token this month, investors have the chance to capitalize on this promising venture and be part of a dynamic community shaping the future of digital entertainment.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here.\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Utility tokens of L2 blockchains serve various purposes, from granting access to ecosystem offerings to paying fees and beyond. One such token that has been garnering significant attention lately is CHO. Serving as the backbone of Choise.ai, CHO already had numerous use cases. However, the announcement of Choise.ai’s upcoming L2 blockchain, Entropy, is supposed to give CHO a substantial boost. Other utility tokens with room for growth include ARB, OP, STRK, and IMX, and we’ll explain why we believe each of these tokens can explode in the medium to long term.\n\nAs mentioned above, Choise.ai announced the forthcoming launch of Entropy, an L2 blockchain focused on B2B and enterprise, and powered by AI. CHO will lay the foundation for Entropy’s long-term growth, fostering its scalability and sustainability.\n\nThis L2 will offer a no-code environment for those seeking to create, build, and flourish in the realm of Web3. This will be accomplished through the use of AI models for smart contract generation and optimization, completely eliminating human error, ensuring seamless operation, and reducing costs simultaneously. Additionally, developers will have the opportunity to monetize their AI models through integration with a blockchain-based AI model marketplace. This level of innovation has not been seen on any other blockchain, and it will be incredibly exciting to see how things unfold from here.\n\nCHO holders will be given various kinds of benefits, such as access to new platform features, airdrops, partner rewards, and more. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Other perks of holding CHO include receiving up to 20% of Choise.ai’s B2B revenue through the soon-to-be-launched VLT token, which will be exclusively credited to CHO holders, giving a super boost to their staking income. CHO will also incentivize legitimate transactions within Choise.ai’s innovative Tringlr SMPC technology, which will serve as the base for ultra-secure digital wallets. Lastly, the token was recently launched on the BSC network, with a $500,000 prize pool for transfers to BSC, aligning with Choise.ai’s vision of supporting community programs and reducing transaction costs.\n\nGiven all this, it’s clear that CHO has potential matched by very few other tokens. It’s a hidden gem for anyone seeking tokens with great utility. And with the impending launch of Entropy, CHO is about to get to new heights.\n\nARB is the utility token of the Arbitrum Network, launched in May 2021 with the aim of enhancing scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness compared to the ETH network. Indeed, Arbitrum can handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency.\n\nARB tokens are also used for governance within the Arbitrum DAO and serve as rewards for validation nodes. Validators can stake tokens on the network, thereby enhancing its security.\n\nDespite its strengths, ARB has encountered several challenges. For example, during the ARB airdrop scheduled for last March, a significant percentage of intended recipients, around 10,000, did not receive their tokens, while some who did were subject to high fees. Although the team resolved the issues, some participants were left with a bitter taste, leading them to exit the project.\n\nOptimism, another L2 solution, utilizes optimistic rollups, which are cheaper than pessimistic rollups, enabling smooth transaction processing without causing network congestion or exorbitant fees. These optimistic rollups ensure network security with most transactions being executed automatically, but if a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent, the system undergoes a verification process to confirm its legitimacy.\n\nThe OP token has two main functions: operations and governance. Holders can vote on upgrades and proposals, earn rewards for contributions to the network, and stake their tokens.\n\nHowever, the main problem with this network, which you could already guess, pertains to security. While the fraud-proof scheme theoretically works, there are instances where fraudulent transactions or actions go undetected, leaving the network vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors.\n\nStarknet is a ZK rollup for Ethereum and a Layer 2 blockchain that ensures high performance, security, and low fees using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Although the blockchain is still in development, its native token, STRK, was airdropped to the community in February.\n\nThere’s a lot of excitement around Starknet, and its developer community is quite strong. Anyone looking to build on Starknet can find resources in their Developer Hub, and Cairo, the network’s native smart contract language, further simplifies things for developers.\n\nLike most other L2 native tokens, STRK can be staked, used for governance, paying transaction fees, and maintaining the network. Soon, it is expected to release a range of data availability solutions and a permissionless sequencer and prover. Although the project overall seems promising, there are some posts on Reddit suggesting it could be a pump-and-dump scenario orchestrated by venture capitalists.\n\nImmutable X is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum NFTs that supports both NFT minting and trading with no fees, is carbon-neutral, and incredibly fast, achieving up to 9,000 transactions per second.\n\nWhat sets it apart from other NFT marketplaces is that trades are executed instantly, ZK rollups provide high security, it includes a built-in wallet, has a global order book that aggregates NFTs from different marketplaces, and offers APIs and SDKs that make it easy for developers to build Web3 apps.\n\nThe platform’s native token, IMX, is its first and native NFT. The IMX token is used for paying transaction fees, voting, and staking on Immutable X. These tokens can also be locked in staking pools. However, despite the project’s overall strength and the token’s potential, it may not appeal to people who are not interested in NFTs.\n\nIt looks like 2024 is the year of L2 native tokens, and since we’re almost halfway through, some of the listed tokens have already appreciated significantly, while others still have room to grow. However, among the five, it’s clear that CHO has the greatest utility. Entropy will offer a much broader range of possibilities compared to other L2s, making CHO a token with immense potential. At its current price, it’s definitely a steal and could be a good buy.\n\n",

    "summary": "After enduring a 20% correction, and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, BTC has managed to stage a strong comeback.\n\n",
    "content": "After enduring a significant 20% price correction earlier this month that saw Bitcoin fall below $56,400 and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has managed to stage a strong comeback. It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone.\n\nThe resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated:\n\nThe inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.\n\nNotably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million.\n\nBeyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March.\n\nThe renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital has pointed out that despite Bitcoin recording a bull flag breakout confirmation, the asset still needs to secure a daily close above $67,000 to continue its trend of higher highs and confirm the potential for further upside.\n\nThe analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process. As part of this, Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin should be able to revisit the range high of $71,500 over time.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is trading at $68,130, up a substantial 9% in the last week alone and over 8% in the last fourteen days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency world is witnessing a familiar sight: a meme coin on fire. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s favorite frog, has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leaving investors wondering if this is the dawn of a new era or a fleeting fad.\n\nOver the past month, PEPE has been on a tear, exceeding expectations and leaving a trail of green for investors. The price triumphantly reached a new all-time high, surging over 100% in just 30 days. This astronomical rise translated to happy hodlers, with IntoTheBlock data revealing that a whopping 97% were sitting pretty in profit.\n\nCoinGecko data show that Pepe has risen 56% in the previous week and 99% in the last month, recovering its position as the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization from Dogwifhat (WIF).\n\nThe bullish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. The past 24 hours saw another surge of 3.7%, further propelling PEPE to its current peak. This impressive performance has garnered significant attention, not just financially, but also on social media. The coin’s social volume has spiked, indicating a surge in interest and online chatter.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a whale, a term used for large investors with significant buying power, has been making waves. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, recently reported a whale withdrawing a staggering 500 billion PEPE from Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This mass accumulation suggests a whale-sized vote of confidence in PEPE’s future.\n\nWhile the recent price increase and social media buzz are undoubtedly positive signs, some analysts are urging caution. A closer look at technical indicators reveals potential signs of an overheated market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures buying and selling pressure, has registered a decline.\n\nSimilarly, the Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are both hovering in the overbought zone, suggesting PEPE’s price might be due for a correction.\n\nFurther complicating the picture is the presence of selling pressure. While some investors are piling in, others might be cashing out on their profits. Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, observed a rise in PEPE’s exchange outflow last week, indicating buying pressure. However, they also noted an increase in supply on exchanges, suggesting some investors might be taking advantage of the high price to sell.\n\nNewsBTC analyzed PEPE’s daily chart to gauge the impact of this potential selling pressure. Their analysis suggests that the price might first fall to $0.0000122 before potentially finding support and initiating another bull run. However, a deeper correction could see PEPE plummet to $0.000010 or even lower.\n\nMeanhwhile, Pepe was still among the most traded cryptocurrency assets over the previous day, according to data from Binance, with only BNB Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) surpassing it.\n\nPepe continues to be the most traded meme coin, surpassing popular coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Floki (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nFeatured image from ART street, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Veteran crypto trader, Peter Brandt has issued a warning to the broader crypto community, stating that the industry has yet to experience its biggest disaster. Brandt boldly predicts that this catastrophe will be linked to cryptocurrency staking and the people involved in it.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 24, Brandt labeled crypto staking as one of the biggest threats to the digital currency space. According to the analyst, staking could become the harbinger of disaster for the industry, potentially causing the decline of the market’s reputation and leading to financial losses for traders.\n\nFor more clarity, staking is a popular practice in the crypto industry that involves locking assets for an extended period to help support the blockchain. This allows token holders to participate as validators of the blockchain and earn staking rewards.\n\nBrandt cautioned that digital currency enthusiasts and traders involved in staking should be careful as it could potentially lead to bankruptcy and loss of fortune. He believes that staking may bring shocking future events that could possibly devastate the space.\n\nIn a follow-up post, the trader outlined a progression of events related to staking, highlighting its potential negative impacts on the market.\n\nHe disclosed that crypto staking involves owning, borrowing or leveraging an asset such as Solana and Ethereum. These assets are usually lent out to earn possible revenue, often in the form of interest.\n\nAs staking becomes more widespread and accepted, it could attract the attention and involvement of Central Banks, government treasuries and other governmental authorities. Brandt reveals that this attention may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of the staking process by the government.\n\nConsequently, the introduction of new regulations would have a detrimental effect on the crypto space, fundamentally changing the industry or possibly leading to the end of staking.\n\nBefore issuing his controversial statement about crypto staking, Brandt disclosed that his opinions may not be well received by supporters of popular digital assets such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nTrue to this prediction, many community members dismissed Brandt’s warning that staking could potentially bring disaster to the crypto space. A crypto member criticized Brandt for his statement, asserting that the crypto trader was uninformed about staking processes and was overstating the impacts of staking by claiming it would result in a “disaster.”\n\nAnother crypto member had argued that Brandt’s definition of staking was factually incorrect. He clarified that staking was a process of using coins or tokens to verify and secure the consensus mechanism of a blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, a crypto community member, Tony Edward disclosed that the only risks in staking are associated with Centralized Exchanges (CEX), not with self custody staking.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "The recent approval of the Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday has sparked speculation on the next price movements for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency as the trading launch date approaches.\n\nHowever, significant transfers of Ethereum (ETH) to cryptocurrency exchanges have raised concerns about profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and potential market speculation.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these developments coincide with Ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilke transferring 10,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.\n\nFurthermore, the surge in Ethereum balances on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates a notable increase in tokens available for sale.\n\nThe chart below shows that more than 242,000 ETH have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchange wallets over the past two weeks, signaling increased trading activity that can contribute to price volatility.\n\nThis trend, coupled with Wilke’s transfer, suggests the possibility of a sell-off or an increase in profit-taking among market participants.\n\nWhile industry experts like Anthony Pompliano view the Ethereum ETF approval as a positive sign for the entire industry, traders are advised to exercise caution. For Martinez, the growing number of ETH deposits to exchange wallets implies a potential market reaction characterized by profit-taking or selling pressure.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart, indicating the potential for a retracement or a new downward countdown phase before the upward trend resumes.\n\nDiving into the price analysis, considering the IOMAP (Input-Output Model and Profitability) data, Martinez highlights that Ethereum has a strong demand zone between $3,820 and $3,700, where over 1.81 million addresses bought approximately 1.66 million ETH.\n\nThis range could provide support amid increasing selling pressure. However, if this zone fails to hold, the next key area of support lies between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses acquired over 1.50 million ETH.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum’s most significant resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054, with over 1.16 million addresses purchasing around 574,660 ETH.\n\nMartinez suggests that a daily candlestick close above $4,170 would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially trigger a new upward countdown phase, with a target towards $5,000.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH’s price is $3,719, reflecting a 2.5% retracement over the past 24 hours. However, according to the analyst’s assessment, Ethereum remains within a crucial demand zone.\n\nAs the market approaches the launch and commencement of trading for all eight spot Ethereum ETF applications by the world’s largest asset managers, the exact impact on price action is yet to be fully realized.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "summary": "Crypto Con has predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach its peak in the ongoing bull cycle, based on past BTC peaks.\n\n",
    "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to witness heightened optimism and confidence from investors, Crypto Con, a popular crypto analyst, and enthusiast has predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach its peak in the ongoing bull cycle, based on past BTC runs and their cumulative peaks.\n\nBy analyzing historical data, Crypto Con has identified trends that might pinpoint the time the largest cryptocurrency asset by market reaches its highest point in this cycle. According to the expert, the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) Ergodic Indicator shows that Bitcoin is exactly where it should be in the current bull cycle.\n\nAt this point, Crypto Con believes there is still a lot of room for growth in the upcoming days. Thus, BTC’s current position, which is around a year from cycle peaks, places this cycle’s peak between January and February of 2025. However, December 2024 remains the analyst’s focus, which, at the current rate, is expected to be the cycle’s top month.\n\nCrypto Con further hinted at the recent recovery from a perfectly healthy correction observed in the crypto market as a potential catalyst to drive the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nThe post read:\n\nThe SMI tells us that Bitcoin is right where it should be in the cycle, with much more room for growth. Our current position lines up at about 1 year from cycle tops, which would make this cycle’s top in Jan – Feb 2025. My eye is still on December 2024, a likely cycle top month at our current rate.\n\nGiven that the analyst previously predicted BTC to reach $149,000 by the end of the year, it could mean the expert expects the asset to top out at the level by December. “Bitcoin is still on track for a layer 7 price target of $149,000 by the end of this year,” he stated.\n\nCrypto Con’s prediction is in line with the most precise measurements for Log Regression Curves and the cycle tops in 2021. By then, the more cautious layer 6, which is the layer that denoted the 2013 cycle top, aims to reach the $108,000 level.\n\nDuring the prediction, the expert highlighted a price consolidation, which is a new development in this cycle. However, as volatility decreases, this consolidation is accurate.\n\nCrypto Con has also utilized the Fibonacci Extensions to determine the Bitcoin price peak this cycle. According to cycle retraces highlighted in his chart, the first two cycles approached the 2.618 extension quite closely, while the last struck the 1.618 extension.\n\nOn the possibility that the 1.618 point will repeat itself this cycle, BTC’s price will be at $159,128. “This is one of the many perspectives to be balanced in the basket of possibilities, and I would consider this estimate to be on the optimistic for this cycle,” he added.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is slowly gaining momentum toward $70,000, indicating a 5% increase in the past week. Its market cap is down by 0.25%, while its trading volume is down by 12% in the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "content": "The development of Web3 ecosystems is a significant milestone in the digital domain. They use decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can transform several industries.\n\nThese ecosystems aim to modify our approach to managing digital assets, data, and transactions, transforming online interactions as we now understand them.\n\nWhile there is widespread excitement about Web3, it is crucial to remember that mere popularity does not guarantee sustained success. Several platforms have had challenges sustaining their progress due to a deficiency in ongoing community engagement and expansion.\n\nThe main support mechanism of a robust Web3 ecosystem is its capacity to attract and retain developers. These ecosystems’ applications, innovations, and structures are mostly the developers’ work.\n\nThree main criteria drive their engagement: security, speed, and pricing. Developers seek platforms that provide economical solutions to optimize their spending and manage resources effectively.\n\nAdditionally significant is speed since developers must quickly offer applications and transactions to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. Similar importance is attached to security; developers want tight guidelines and protections to keep their data and assets secure from threats.\n\nWeb3 platforms hoping to establish a vibrant developer community must adhere to the 80/20 rule. This concept holds that creating an environment that fully satisfies developer needs should receive 80% of the work. Platforms that stress building safe, efficient, and reasonably priced infrastructure may provide a solid foundation for developer participation and innovation.\n\nNonetheless, the remaining 20% of funds must be allocated to outreach and incentive initiatives. Although a good environment attracts developers, intentional outreach and incentive schemes are needed to boost community growth and maintain involvement.\n\nPlatforms may effectively include developers through clever partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and special incentive plans, creating a vibrant ecosystem driven by collaboration and creativity.\n\nProm, a Layer 2 solution aimed at improving interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, is one platform that uses incentive programs. It sends transaction proofs to additional chains on the selected Settlement chain, boosting connections across ecosystems.\n\nProm, powered by Polygon, reduces transaction costs using zkSNARKs technology, making it a low-cost blockchain solution. It also uses Polygon Zero and powerful recursive STARK technology for quick transactions and scalable dApp development, which appeals to both developers and consumers. Furthermore, Prom’s EVM-equivalent design facilitates integration with the current Ethereum infrastructure, simplifying development and lowering costs.\n\nProm emphasizes aggressive marketing and comprehensive incentive schemes to increase network participation and foster a dynamic community. It works with teams and products that are vital to the expansion of the ecosystem, as well as providing grants and assistance to projects that contribute to Prom’s development.\n\nProm’s incentive scheme includes a referral program that pays users $PROM tokens to introduce friends and expand its user base. In addition, Prom provides fee kickback rates ranging from 10% to 50% to encourage community members to actively participate in the referral program.\n\nTo build a favorable environment for developers in Web3 ecosystems, platforms must solve their primary concerns: price, speed, and security. They should strive to create cost-effective solutions that enable developers to effectively manage resources and maximize the value of their investments.\n\nSpeed is also important since developers must launch applications quickly and interface with blockchain networks smoothly to remain competitive. Strong security measures are also required to safeguard developers’ assets and data from attacks while increasing confidence in the platform.\n\nSuccessful systems that focus on developer demands provide useful examples. They have incorporated novel methods to increase price, speed, and security, creating a community where developers can interact and contribute. Partnerships, infrastructure optimization, and support campaigns have made these platforms ideal for developers seeking to construct and deploy decentralized apps.\n\nHowever, establishing the best atmosphere for developers is a continuous effort. Platforms must be adaptive, always monitoring and adapting to changes in developer expectations and market trends. Platforms that respond to feedback may improve their products to better suit developers’ changing demands.\n\nThis continual adaption is critical for being competitive and relevant in the ever-changing Web3 scene, as it ensures that platforms remain appealing and useful to developers looking to cooperate and create within decentralized ecosystems.\n\nBuilding strong and long-lasting communities on Web3 platforms isn’t without its challenges. Maintaining relevance in continual technological and business upheavals is a major challenge.\n\nPlatforms also struggle with the harmony between decentralization and governance to include the community while preserving direction. Platforms try to welcome individuals from all origins and points of view; hence, it might be difficult to guarantee diversity and inclusion in the community.\n\nThe long-term sustainability of Web3 platforms relies on their use of focused operations and strategic approaches. It takes open and honest channels of communication that promote trust and collaboration for platforms to deal with problems and seek guidance. Those who can access educational resources and support services could become more active and transform their communities. If we want to create a warm environment where everyone feels valued, diversity and inclusion programs must be encouraged.\n\nPlatforms should also prioritize scalability and interoperability in order to collaborate with other networks and adjust to the community’s evolving requirements. By making partnerships and funding strong technological infrastructure, platforms could overcome large-scale challenges and promote innovation. Using decentralized governance techniques, community members may acquire agency and guarantee that decisions are made openly and advantageously.\n\nBuilding a strong Web3 group takes a lot of time, work, and money. It’s more important to be proactive and thoughtful than to be famous for a short time. To be successful in the difficult Web3 environment over the long term, platforms must focus on community-building projects.\n\nBy investing in involvement and partnerships and adapting to changing needs, platforms can build strong communities that encourage working together and creativity. I want platforms to take action and focus on building active and welcoming communities. This will set the stage for future growth and development in the Web3 environment.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Lido (LDO), the liquid staking protocol for the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, has seen a significant price spike in the last 24 hours following the long-awaited approval of spot Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.\n\nThe protocol’s native token, LDO, has successfully regained the $2.30 level and is looking to break out of its one-month downtrend structure that has been in place since the market correction in April.\n\nAs reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, the SEC’s approval of the Ethereum ETFs was detailed in an official filing, highlighting that the proposals meet the provisions of the Exchange Act and relevant regulations governing national securities exchanges.\n\nThe Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest.\n\nCrypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners.\n\nOne of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming.\n\nDuring the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months.\n\nMoreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.\n\nLooking ahead, bullish investors should closely observe the next resistance level on the LDO/USD daily chart, situated at $2.55. Breaking this level is crucial for breaking the downtrend structure that has persisted over the past month, potentially leading to retests at $2.70 and $2.90.\n\nConversely, the $2.21 zone serves as a significant support level, as it acted as a strong barrier for Lido in the past week and a half before the breakout.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, appears poised for a major move, but the direction remains shrouded in mystery. Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his “Euphoric Bull” theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase.\n\nCheckmate’s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a “Euphoric Bull” phase.\n\n#Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull.\n\nIt also coincides with the MVRV ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt.\n\nBull…Crab…Bull… A… pic.twitter.com/4YyD179LRS\n\n— _Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️ (@_Checkmatey_) May 21, 2024\n\nHowever, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout.\n\n\n\nBitcoin’s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend.\n\nHowever, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs.\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency in 2025. The high-end prediction of $168,459 represents a staggering potential increase, fueled by factors like historical price trends and the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. Buoying this optimism are technical indicators pointing towards a “Bullish” market sentiment with a hefty dose of “Extreme Greed.”\n\nHowever, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon.\n\nFeatured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView\n\n",

The pioneer of cryptocurrency has become a pillar of the investment industry and continues to break records on a regular basis. 10,000 BTC was worth two pizzas back in 2010, but one single BTC today is worth north of $60,000.\n\n\n\nLARGEST SWISS BANK OWNS BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/ZX8HkW5pwI\n\n— borovik (@3orovik) May 13, 2024\n\nLet’s take a look at Bitcoin’s history to see if it’s better as a short-term or long-term investment, or if it’s both!\n\nBitcoin has become one of the most well-known investments around the world. Even if you are not a tech-genius, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of it. Everyone might not understand how it all works, but what most people know is that it’s worth a lot of money.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin is still very recent, in the grand scheme of things. At the beginning, the price of one Bitcoin was $0.00099. That’s right, not even worth a single penny. Nowadays, it’s worth upwards of $60,000.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Bitcoin’s highest price ever was $73,835.57, which happened on March 14th of 2024. 10,000 BTC bought you two pizzas (roughly $40) back in 2010, but now, just one BTC can buy more than 7,300 pies.\n\nObviously, Bitcoin is used for more than just pizza purchases. It’s now recognized as a currency in several countries, including the United States, El Salvador, Japan, India, China, and others. You can do a lot of different things with Bitcoin, such as using it for everyday purchases, gambling with it at crypto accepted casinos, and more.\n\nWe might be able to get a glimpse of Bitcoin’s future by taking a look at the past. It has come a long way since it opened at $0.00099, but it was not a smooth ride. The price of Bitcoin has been quite high in recent memory, but it has plummeted several times in the past.\n\n\n\n(source: investing.com)\n\nBitcoin was worth just under $6 back in 2012, but it surpassed the $100 mark in April of 2013. It was jus under $1,000 in late 2013, but fell back down to about $230 in February of 2015. It cracked $1,000 about two years later (2017), but this time it went all the way up to about $17,000.\n\nTwo years after reaching nearly $17,000, Bitcoin took a $10,000 drop and ended up at around $7,000 entering 2020. It was then that Bitcoin really started to boom. A lot of people got into investing after the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bitcoin’s price soared to over $60,000 for the first time.\n\nEverything started going back to normal shortly after and people decided to sell. Bitcoin’s price dropped to just $17,000 in late December of 2022, but has steadily climbed since then. Not long after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, it topped its previous record high at $73,835.57 a few weeks ago, and has been sitting above $62,000 since.\n\nWhat do these ups and downs teach us about Bitcoin? Well, it seems that there’s about an equal chance that it will either break it’s previous all-time record, or plummet back down.\n\nThe main thing that everyone is wondering is if they should invest in Bitcoin or not. Truth be told, there’s not really a right or wrong answer. It mainly has to do with personal preferences, as well as the amount of risk you are willing to take.\n\nAs we’ve seen throughout Bitcoin’s history, it seems as if the chances of it rising or falling are about equal to each other. Maybe the recent new all-time high proves that it’s in it for the long haul, but we can’t exactly guarantee that.\n\nFrom both a short-term and long-term perspective, Bitcoin should be looked at as a highly volatile investment. If you are a firm believer in blockchain technology and decentralized currency, I recommend investing in Bitcoin. It can be something that helps you get rich quick, but Bitcoin’s future is not easily predictable.\n\n\n\nImage: Unsplash\n\n",

    "content": "Following the sudden approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF last week, speculations continue to roll in on the potential performance of these funds ahead of their debut trading session. Most recently, renowned Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart has weighed in on the subject giving his thoughts on the possible level of investments the Ethereum spot ETFs could pull in relation to their Bitcoin-based equivalents.\n\nIn an interview session on X on May 24 hosted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, Seyffart stated that the Ether spot ETFs would likely experience a maximum of 25% of the demand seen by the Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart based his predictions on multiple elements starting with enormous differences in market caps between both assets. According to data from CoinMarket, Ethereum’s total market shares are valued at $449.25 billion which is roughly equal to 30% of BTC’s 1.35 trillion market cap.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst also highlighted the large disparities in the difference between both ETFs and their base assets. According to Seyffart, there is a bigger gap between Ethereum as an ETF and as a cryptocurrency than Bitcoin as an ETF and as itself.\n\nThe ETF analyst believes that the ETH spot ETFs will limit investors from native ETH features such as staking, a prominent source of passive income, and other on-chain use cases in terms of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. Thus, certain investors might prefer to invest directly in the altcoin.\n\nWith all these factors in consideration, Seyffart predicts these novel investment funds will produce “big launches” but not at the level of the Bitcoin spot ETFs. He predicts the Ethereum Spot ETFs will record between 20-25% of investments in their Bitcoin-based peers once trading commences. Meanwhile, fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas appears less optimistic with a projection of 15-20%.\n\nUndoubtedly, the performance of the Ethereum spot ETFs will be influential on other crypto spot ETFs that may gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, the XRP ETF is tipped by many enthusiasts as the next debutant in the market but this is still subject to many factors, most especially regulatory clarity on the institutional sales of XRP.\n\nIn other news, Ethereum is trading at $3,766 with a 0.51% gain in the last day. This slight positive performance underscores Ethereum’s form all week with a combined 20.47% gain recorded in the last seven days. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 51.27% and is valued at $10.03 billion.\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge.\n\nMarks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from.\n\n\n\nThe crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.”\n\nMarks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights.\n\nOne way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up.\n\nIt is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside.\n\nGenuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator.\n\nFurthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough.\n\nMeanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Space.com, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross still has a high value, a sign that may be bearish for BTC.\n\nIn a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price.\n\nThe NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now.\n\nWhen the indicator’s value is high, it suggests the network’s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently.\n\nOn the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume.\n\nIn the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years:\n\nIn the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset.\n\nThe Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn’t been able to visit the bullish region yet.\n\nAt present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen.\n\nIt’s possible that Bitcoin won’t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone.\n\nIt now remains to be seen how the indicator develops in the near future and whether its changes will affect the BTC price.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $64,900 mark, up more than 4% over the past week.\n\n",

    "summary": "On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has provided insights into why the Bitcoin price recently dropped below $70,000.\n\n",
    "content": "On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has provided insights into why the Bitcoin price recently dropped below $70,000. The platform suggested that the flagship isn’t yet seeing enough demand, which could send its price to new highs.\n\nIn one of its latest market reports, Glassnode mentioned that “the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak.” They made this assertion based on the Realized Cap metric, which measures the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was traded. Glassnode claimed that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is currently at $574 billion.\n\nThe platform further revealed that the injection of liquidity into Bitcoin has cooled off since the flagship crypto hit an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This is in stark contrast to the period before Bitcoin hit that ATH, with Glassnode noting that the flows into Bitcoin back then were “extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38 billion daily.”\n\nMeanwhile, Glassnode stated that the Realized Cap “remains in positive profit-dominated territory and is returning towards an equilibrium position.” However, they noted that Bitcoin’s modest demand was still able to spark this recent rally thanks to the “declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors.”\n\nBasically, Glassnode suggested that things were looking up for Bitcoin but that it could be way better if there were more capital inflows. There could indeed be an increase in capital inflows soon enough, considering that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have broken their streak of net outflows and are once again recording impressive net inflows into their funds.\n\nData from Farside Investors shows that these funds have already seen almost $700 million in net inflows this week. Specifically, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $305.7 million on May 21 alone. That day was also BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) most profitable day yet, with the fund taking in $290 million.\n\nGlassnode also assessed some other vital on-chain metrics, which provided some positives for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The platform noted that there has been a “large decline” in Bitcoin’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which “suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.”\n\nTo assess market volatility, they also measured the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days. They concluded that “volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations and prior to large market moves.”\n\nMeanwhile, Glasnode revealed that 2.14M BTC out of the Short-term holder (STH) supply, currently at 3.36M BTC, fell into an unrealized loss following the recent market correction. They claim that this suggests that many of the BTC held by this category of investors are held at an unrealized loss, which reduces the risk of top-heaviness developing.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Bitcoin is retracing at spot rates but one analyst thinks the coin will reach $80,000 by end of May and $95,000 in June\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin is fast-dropping, looking at price action in the daily chart. Even after the impressive spike above $71,500 early this week, there needs to be a conclusive follow-through for optimistic bulls. Despite this correction, one analyst strongly believes Bitcoin will rally sharply, reaching $80,000 by the end of the month.\n\nTaking to X, the analyst thinks HODLers, not speculators, will reap the maximum benefits from Bitcoin. Based on the trader’s assessment, not only will BTC fly above $80,000 by the end of May, but the coin will also spike to peak at $95,000 in June.\n\nAccordingly, reading from the candlestick arrangement, those who position themselves at spot rates might enter at favorable prices, scooping the coin at a discount. Even so, when BTC flies to $95,000 in less than seven weeks from now, the trader expects prices to cool off.\n\nThe retracement will also wash out speculators hitching the leg up.\n\nAt spot rates, the path of least resistance is northward. BTC is also down roughly 6% from this week’s highs, although the uptrend remains. The $72,000 line is emerging as a strong resistance level as prices continue to move horizontally. On the lower end, $60,000 is worth watching.\n\nFor the uptrend to take shape, a high volume must be close to $72,000. Of note is that bulls have yet to breach and close above this line since the surge to all-time highs in mid-March.\n\n\n\nSentiment will play a key role in propelling prices higher. So far, the analyst acknowledges that there is a shift in sentiment. As the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly prepares to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors have been rotating capital to ETH.\n\nThis has slowed the momentum, even lowering prices, as in the current case. The ETHBTC price chart shows that Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, adding 25% from mid-May 2024.\n\nThere has been no official communication from the United States SEC on spot ETH ETF approval. However, the analyst believes the agency will disappoint the market by unexpectedly rejecting all proposals. Should this be the case, the crypto markets will clam up, ending what the trader claims have been “manipulative practices.”\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how the data of an oscillator for Bitcoin could suggest the cryptocurrency still has plenty of room to run in this rally.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discussed what the latest trend in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for BTC might suggest regarding what could be next for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe VWAP is an indicator that calculates the average price for any asset by taking into account the price fluctuations themselves and weighing the values against the trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume.\n\nTraditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain’s transparency.\n\nThe indicator of interest here isn’t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero.\n\nThe chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years.\n\nThe above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric’s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly.\n\nIn the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency’s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum.\n\nThe resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top. That hasn’t happened for the VWAP Oscillator this time yet. “Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation,” says the analyst. “Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.”\n\nIn other news, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in an X post, retail investors have bought $135.7 million worth of the asset over the past month.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $65,000, up 5% over the last week.\n\n",

Our team of seasoned casino professionals spared no effort in scrutinising dozens of non GamStop casino sites to unveil the best ones with the highest rate of payouts.\n\nAt the foundation of our evaluation of the best non GamStop casino sites lies the legitimacy of the platform. We meticulously examined the licensing and regulatory framework governing each casino, ensuring compliance with stringent standards to guarantee a safe and secure gambling environment.\n\nA diverse and engaging array of games is paramount to a memorable gambling experience. We delved deep into each casino’s game library, assessing the variety, quality, and innovation across slots, table games, live dealer options, and speciality titles.\n\nCentral to our assessment is the payout percentage, a critical metric indicating the return players can expect over the long term. Our team meticulously analysed payout rates across various games, prioritising platforms that offer consistently high RTP (Return to Player) percentages.\n\nWe understand the allure of enticing bonuses and promotions in the competitive world of online gambling. Our experts scrutinised the generosity, terms, and conditions of bonus offers, ensuring they provide genuine value to players without compromising on fairness.\n\nSeamless transactions are essential for a hassle-free gambling experience. We evaluated the diversity, speed, and reliability of payment methods supported by each casino, prioritising platforms that cater to a wide range of preferences and offer swift withdrawals.\n\nIn the dynamic realm of online gambling, responsive and efficient customer support can make all the difference. We assessed the responsiveness, professionalism, and accessibility of customer support channels, prioritising casinos that prioritise player satisfaction.\n\nNavigating a casino’s platform should be intuitive and enjoyable. Our team meticulously examined the user interface, mobile compatibility, and overall user experience, ensuring players can seamlessly immerse themselves in the thrill of gambling.\n\nTrust is paramount in the online gambling industry. We conducted thorough assessments of each casino’s security protocols, encryption methods, and commitment to fairness, ensuring players can gamble with peace of mind.\n\nSome players from the UK who are new to gambling may wonder what GamStop is. Here, we will explain what GamStop is, along with alternative exclusion tools.\n\nGamStop is a free self-exclusion program available to UK residents that helps individuals manage their gambling habits. Once registered, users are blocked from accessing and creating accounts on all online gambling websites and apps licensed by the UK Gambling Commission for a chosen period (6 months, 1 year, or 5 years). This tool is designed to aid those struggling with problem gambling by limiting their ability to gamble online, promoting responsible gambling practices. Users cannot revoke their self-exclusion until the chosen period ends, ensuring a robust barrier against compulsive gambling behaviours.\n\nSimilarly, GamBan is another software tool that helps individuals block access to online gambling sites and apps on their devices. Just like GamStop, it restricts access to thousands of gambling websites and applications, providing a barrier against online gambling across multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. However, unlike GamStop, which is limited to UK-licensed sites, GamBan offers broader protection by blocking gambling content globally.\n\nThere are positive and negative aspects to playing at unrestricted online casinos available to players from the UK. Understanding these pros and cons can help players make informed decisions when considering non-GamStop casinos.\n\nWhile online casinos regulated by the UKGC are required to sign-up to GamStop, non GamStop casino sites are still licensed and regulated, ensuring these sites are safe and fair to play at.\n\nThe best non GamStop casino sites have a gambling licence and are regulated by the following bodies:\n\nCuraçao is one of the oldest and most common licensing jurisdictions for non-GamStop casinos. The Curaçao eGaming licence is known for its relatively straightforward and cost-effective application process. It offers a single licence that covers all types of gambling activities, making it an attractive option for operators. However, while it ensures a basic level of oversight, it may not be as stringent as some other regulators in terms of consumer protection and operational standards.\n\nThe MGA is highly respected within the online gambling industry and is known for its rigorous standards and comprehensive regulatory framework. Casinos licensed by the MGA must adhere to strict rules regarding fair play, player protection, and financial transparency. This makes Malta-licensed casinos generally safer and more reliable for players, even if they are not on GamStop.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) is a crucial metric for online casino players in the UK, as it indicates the percentage of wagered money a slot of casino games is expected to return to players over time. It can impact gaming choices, trust in the gambling industry, and the overall gaming experience. Let’s break down the main reason why RTP is important:\n\nRTP Helps players make informed decisions about which game to play. Higher RTP% means better chances of winning in the long run, allowing players to choose games that potentially offer more favourable returns.\n\nRTP ensures fairness and transparency. Casinos are required to publish RTP figures, as is a stipulation of obtaining a gambling licence. This gives players confidence that games are not rigged and that they have a fair chance of winning.\n\nUnderstanding RTP allows players to manage their budgets more effectively. By knowing how much a game is likely to retire, players can better plan their spending and gambling strategy.\n\nCasino games with higher RTPs generally provide a more enjoyable experience, as players experience fewer losses and more frequent wins, making the gaming session rewarding and entertaining.\n\nWhile regulations from the UKGC are very strict, most other iGaming licensing bodies also have regulations which adhere to RTP%. This ensures that games meet specific standards of fairness and reliability, protecting players from dodgy practices. It is a red flag if a casino refuses to include the RTP% of the games on their site.\n\nThe most popular payment methods at non-GamStop casinos typically include a mix of traditional and modern options to cater to a diverse player base.\n\nCredit cards are banned from being used at online casinos in the UK which are regulated by UKGC. However, Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted at non-GamStop casinos, offering convenience and familiarity to players who prefer using their bank cards for transactions.\n\nE-wallets like PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller are popular due to their speed, security, and ease of use. They allow for fast deposits and withdrawals, with many players appreciating the additional layer of privacy they provide.\n\nDirect bank transfers or wire transfers are another common payment method at non-GamStop casinos. While they may take longer to process compared to other methods, bank transfers are preferred by players who prioritise security and reliability.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as payment methods at non-GamStop casinos due to their decentralised nature, fast transactions, and enhanced privacy features.\n\nPrepaid cards like Paysafecard are convenient for players who prefer not to share their banking details online. These cards can be purchased at various retail outlets and used to make secure deposits at non-GamStop casinos.\n\nMobile payment services like Apple Pay and Google Pay are becoming increasingly popular for online transactions, offering a seamless and secure way to fund casino accounts using mobile devices.\n\nSome non-GamStop casinos may also accept alternative payment methods like ecoPayz, Trustly, or cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin, providing players with even more options to choose from.\n\nDue to tight regulations from the UKGC on online gambling, players from the UK scour the internet for the best non GamStop casino sites which have high payouts. There is a desire for more freedom and flexibility in their gambling experience, access to a wider range of table games and slots not on GamStop, bigger bonuses, and the avoidance of strict self-exclusion measures imposed by Gamstop. If you find yourself looking for casinos not on GamStop which ticks all these boxes and more, Casino Charles is the casino for you.\n\nIn our expert opinion, Casino Charles is the best casino not on GamStop with the highest payout.\n\nYes, non-GamStop casinos are legal, but they are not licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. Instead, they typically hold licences from other jurisdictions like Curaçao, Malta, or Gibraltar.\n\nPlayers might choose non-GamStop casinos to avoid self-exclusion restrictions, enjoy a wider variety of games, benefit from fewer betting limits, or take advantage of better bonuses and promotions.\n\nYes, UK players can legally play at non GamStop casino sites, but they should be aware that these sites are not regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, which means different consumer protections may apply.\n\nYes, most non-GamStop casinos offer customer support through live chat, email, and sometimes phone. It’s advisable to choose a casino with reliable and responsive customer service.\n\nLook for fastest withdrawal casinos with positive reviews, secure SSL encryption, valid licences from reputable jurisdictions, and transparent terms and conditions. Player testimonials and third-party review sites can also be helpful.\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "Rekt Capital provides an insight into Bitcoin recent price movement and predicts the start of the highly-anticipated bullish run. \n\n",
    "content": "Following the Bitcoin halving in April, analysts and investors remain on the edge of their seats in anticipation of a major price breakout by the maiden cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin did rise to $71,443 in the past week, the token soon suffered a retracement falling as low as $66,936. Interestingly, renowned analyst with X handle Rekt Capital has provided an interesting insight into this recent price movement and also predicted the period BTC may finally embark on a highly-anticipated bullish run.\n\nIn a series of X posts on May 24, Rekt Capital noted that after the halving event, Bitcoin entered the “post-halving danger zone”, a period during which the token lost about 11% of its value. Following this phase, the most-priced cryptocurrency attempted a breakout which encountered a rejection at the range high zone ($71,500) of the macro re-accumulation range.\n\n#BTC\n\nSince the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71500\n\nHowever, ~$71500 is where the Range High resistance of the Macro Re-Accumulation Range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from\n\nThe consolidation continues and history suggest it will… https://t.co/YjZzimnFj9 pic.twitter.com/JGji7ZYOSe\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 24, 2024\n\nFor context, this range represents a long-term consolidation phase where Bitcoin accumulates value before potentially breaking out to new highs. Rekt Capital states that Bitcoin being rejected at the $71,500 price region is quite expected as BTC never breaks through the high side of the re-accumulation range on the first attempt after halving.\n\nBased on historical price data, Rekt Capital anticipates Bitcoin will now remain in consolidation for multiple weeks until 160 days after halving before finally experiencing its major price breakout in September. During this time, the premier cryptocurrency is expected to trade between $60,000 and $70,000 which will result in variations in the portfolio valuation for long-term investors.\n\nHowever, this price consolidation can also present opportunities for these investors to buy Bitcoin near the lower boundary of the range thus consistently accumulating at relatively stable prices. Meanwhile, short-term traders such as swing traders or day traders are likely to capitalize on these expected price fluctuations between an established support and resistance which could result in significant profit.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $68,720, marking a 2.27% gain in the last day, a 2.31% gain over the past week, and a 6.90% increase in the last month. Despite these gains, its daily trading volume has dropped by 45.68%, now valued at $24 billion. BTC is also 6.94% below its all-time high of $73,750. The recent price rise amid declining trading volume suggests cautious investor sentiment, with Bitcoin consolidating within a narrow range as the crypto market leader once again approaches significant resistance levels.\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from Tradingview\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a sea of uncertainty, and Avalanche (AVAX) is no exception. While AVAX has displayed some resilience compared to its altcoin peers, a closer look reveals a market grappling with conflicting signals – a mix of cautious optimism and underlying unease.\n\nThe future of AVAX remains shrouded in uncertainty. While some positive signs exist, like relative outperformance and pockets of bullish sentiment, they are countered by concerning metrics like dwindling market control and a significant drop in trading activity.\n\nA look at AVAX’s six-month chart reveals a rollercoaster ride, characterized by sharp peaks and troughs. This volatility highlights AVAX’s susceptibility to broader market trends and its dependence on specific developments within its ecosystem.\n\nOver the past few months, AVAX has exhibited a pattern of price spikes followed by equally sharp corrections. Currently, the altcoin seems to be consolidating around the $38 mark after a recent dip from April’s highs.\n\nIf AVAX can maintain support around the crucial $35 level, there’s a possibility for a northward trajectory, especially if a broader bull run materializes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, significant resistance awaits at $48 and $53 – price points that AVAX has repeatedly tested and failed to surpass in recent months. A sustained breakout above these levels would signal a significant shift in momentum, potentially propelling AVAX towards the $80 or even $100 mark by the third quarter.\n\nThe trading scene surrounding AVAX presents a curious dichotomy. Coinglass data reveals a staggering 60% drop in trading volume, signifying a significant decline in market activity. This is further corroborated by a relatively balanced long/short ratio across various platforms, suggesting overall indecision among traders regarding AVAX’s future.\n\nHowever, a glimmer of bullish sentiment emerges from Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. Here, the long/short ratio skews considerably higher, indicating a potentially more optimistic outlook among individual traders on this specific platform.\n\nMeanwhile, with a 40% rating on the Fear and Greed Index, the current status of the AVAX market is characterized by neutral mood, indicating that investors have balanced opinions.\n\nAVAX’s struggles extend beyond trading. The altcoin seems to be loosening its grip on market share, with search interest also declining. This translates to a lack of market control and potentially waning general interest – not exactly the recipe for success for a token aiming for significant gains.\n\nFeatured image from Summitpost, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Things are moving fast in the crypto scene — now a new meta of Telegram clicker apps has appeared on the market, dwarfing the neverending multitude of the sophisticated capital-heavy DeFi and GameFi apps by attracting millions of users. MemeFi is at the forefront of the new narrative, with unexpected ties to Linea, an EVM chain, rather than TON, a native Telegram blockchain.\n\nMemeFi is an ecosystem featuring two mass-appeal apps: Web3 Social Tech game and a Telegram Clicker App. A simple clicker idle game has attracted more than 6.5M users, with DAU standing at an astonishing 1.5 million users.\n\nStill, MemeFi leads the way, firmly resting in the top 3. One important and a rather unique feature of the app is the gamification — a testament to sophistication in simplicity. While tapping, the user actually fights various cartoon-styled meme bosses and does damage to them. If the boss runs out of health, the player ascends to a new level, with a new boss unlocked and more coins to earn.\n\nThis does not exhaust the gaming aspect of the app, as players are limited in energy and may engage various boosters, as well as make upgrades in order to improve their experience.\n\nCoupled with a unique art style, created by a full-blown art studio who seem to know well the exoteric culture of crypto memes, the game is visually appealing and much more engaging than simpler clicker apps. It might be quite fair to say that social media abound in MemeFi-inspired videos and other types of content.\n\nWhen it comes to novelty, MemeFi Web3 app certainly has a lot to offer. The app is an idle game that comes with a spin: players unite in meme clans and fight ridiculous crypto-inspired bosses to earn rewards that other players can tap into via keys!\n\nKeys are a Social Tech feature introduced last summer, with the release of friend.tech, that represent players’ social capital. Since their prices are not directly set by supply and demand but rather change along a bonding curve through a liquidity pool mechanism, users are incentivized to behave in a competitive manner, speculating on key prices.\n\nMemeFi turned the bonding curve-powered asset into a sort of a bond, as players receive yield based on their share of another player’s key supply. This provides an economically-viable framework for keys that elevates them much higher than just a mere representation of social capital, which is, to say the least, quite an ethereal notion.\n\nThe new way “to do Social Tech” has attracted the attention of Linea, a leading player in the L2 sphere. With the MemeFi Web3 app launching on Linea, as well as social media activity, it is quite clear that the project has strong ties with the blockchain team. Even more obvious is that the Clicker App might have a bigger role to play in the development of the Linea ecosystem.\n\nThe immense potential and the number of clickers have been realized quickly by many in Web3. First leveraged by TON via Notcoin, along with top tier exchanges, including Binance, OKX and ByBit, the never-seen-before-in-crypto traffic is being channeled to their corresponding products.\n\nNow that TON has become too competitive of an environment for clickers, other blockchains might be looking at opportunities to grow their userbases tapping into these apps’ massive audiences. Linea seems to be a leader in this regard, becoming a close partner of one of the most used mass-appeal apps on Telegram.\n\nThis suggests Linea is highly motivated to provide full support to the MemeFi team, taking advantage of their success and upcoming listing. Now we are at a breakpoint where we might soon witness a mass conversion campaign of MemeFi users to Linea and the MemeFi Web3 app.\n\nWith clickers becoming the new narrative, MemeFi is one of the few apps that might attract a completely new audience to an EVM chain rather than TON — if successful, this will certainly threaten the current status-quo, where TON is able to monopolize the user base of Telegram, being closely associated with the social media giant.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Analysts from leading international cross-border bank, Standard Chartered have made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could witness a significant rise to new all-time highs above $73,700. This projection, slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an unexpected and wholly ambitious timeline.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research, Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In an email to TheBlock, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin is poised to break out of its previous all-time high on March 14, 2024, to witness a massive surge to approximately $73,798.\n\nThe analyst has projected a rather grandiose timeline for this bullish rally, expecting Bitcoin to hit the forecasted price target by the weekend. Kendrick attributed this potential price increase to the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEarlier on May 21, data from Farside investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had recorded their best inflow week in the last two months. The digital asset saw over $305.7 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), amassing the largest inflows of $290 million.\n\nCumulatively, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows of more than $13 billion from its launch on January 11 to the present. This increased demand and influx of capital which had been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March, could propel fresh surges for the cryptocurrency.\n\nKendrick has also disclosed that the possible approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The analyst has doubled down on his previous price prediction which anticipates Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and a whopping $200,000 increase in 2025.\n\nAs of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $70,013, reflecting a slight decline of 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady bullish momentum over the past week, experiencing consistent price surges, which have led to a sharp increase of 12.86%.\n\nPopular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has reported that Bitcoin is up more than 20% since its previous lows of $56,000 earlier this year. The approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could see the cryptocurrency’s price potentially rising more, following previous patterns when the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered a major price spike for the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nThis sentiment for a bullish breakout is shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has asserted that Bitcoin is currently showing a strong potential for further gains, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s robust price potential and strong fundamentals.\n\n",

    "content": "While top DeFi token, Solana, continues to recover in the broader market, SOL bulls are reeling with optimism, with many expecting the token to reach $200. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) has sparked excitement among traders and crypto enthusiasts after the announcement of its unique revenue-sharing model.\n\nRollblock’s emergence into the cryptocurrency market has sparked interest among traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Currently, in its presale’s second stage, Rollblock (RBLK) has demonstrated enormous potential, promising users and buyers incredible returns. Its ecosystem presents a roadmap unlike no other, gearing to change the narrative in the casino world.\n\nUnlike its traditional rivals, Rollblock offers a smooth sign-up process, prioritizing user privacy and convenience in today’s digital world. In addition, its incorporation of cryptocurrency as well as seamless onboarding process draws diverse users across the crypto market, especially with no need for KYC verification or extra downloads.\n\nFurthermore, Rollblock introduces a unique revenue-sharing model that could potentially change the dynamics in the GameFi market. While trying to repurchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, the Rollblock network sets aside up to 30% of its weekly revenue to achieve this. Furthermore, Rollblock’s token-burn feature ensures that 50% of repurchased tokens are removed from the market, while the other half goes to staking rewards.\n\nMeanwhile, the native RBLK token currently trades for $0.012 per token, which reflects 20% increase from an initial offering price of $0.01 as well as heightened buyer interes. As it awaits its listing on a major crypto exchange, market experts are touting Rollblock to soar to the top, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year.\n\nOne of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana (SOL) has proven time and again to be a formidable player in the crypto space. Notably, Solana is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve scalability concerns in the crypto market by introducing proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism.\n\nBesides its unique features, Solana has also demonstrated exceptional strength in the broader DeFi market. In the last year, Solana has surged over 760%, demonstrating its resilience despite the bear market. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $146.8 and $178.6, SOL token has shown signs of recovery with analysts projecting a resurgence for the token.\n\nFurthermore, Solana network’s success can be partly attributed to emergence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With tokens like Dogwifhat and Bonk taking centerstage, there has been a growing interest in the Solana network as a whole. Moreso, while this has spurred optimism, analysts are projecting Solana to soar and reach the $200 mark very soon. With its current mass adoption and growing market cap, Solana maintains a solid spot among top Defi tokens in the crypto market.\n\nRollblock’s ascent in the crypto market has been quite commendable, with the token exploding into the scene without much hassle. This is a result of its innovative features and distinct roadmap which give it an edge over other new tokens. With its current trajectory, market experts are touting it to mirror and surpass some of the top DeFi tokens in the market.\n\n",

    "content": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim, COO of the digital asset trading platform, Websea, where he shares his insights about web3 adoption.\n\nQ. Hello. Would you please introduce yourself and share your professional journey with our readers?\n\nHi, I’m Herbert and it’s wonderful to be here. I’m currently the COO of Websea, a youth-focused web3 digital asset trading platform.\n\nBefore Websea, I worked as the Global Operations Director at Huobi Global and Chief Marketing Officer at Cryptology Exchange. So I’ve been in operational management in the FinTech sector for a fairly long time.\n\nMost people know me as ‘The Bitcoin Man’ for my work as an angel investor and advisor for crypto projects. The Bitcoin Man is now a venture capital fund where I continue to invest and incubate promising startups.\n\nI’m also the founder of Crypto Chain University (CCU), a non-profit institute and digital repository for blockchain research and policy-oriented work. CCU is a passion project and comes from my desire to make web3 accessible to people.\n\nI believe the web3 sector has much to do to bring decentralized protocols to the masses. So I continue to work hard to realize the vision of ‘onboarding the next billion’ to crypto.\n\nQ. Why do you think the web3 industry hasn’t yet reached mass crypto adoption? What does the industry need to do to bring more people into web3?\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of easy-to-use, smooth, and efficient web3 protocols with an engaging user interface. We can’t expect newcomers to navigate complicated apps to store or use digital assets daily.\n\nSo web2 users need a seamless transition to web3 protocols where they don’t require any technical knowledge to operate the apps. Moreover, web3 apps must integrate attractive features and financial incentives to appeal to first-time users.\n\nFor instance, crypto exchanges function as the main gateway to enter web3 for investing and trading in crypto and NFTs. These exchanges serve as the primary circulation hubs for the digital asset economy to transact globally without any restrictions.\n\nHowever, most crypto exchanges have a difficult user interface that doesn’t appeal to new users. Thus we need more exchanges that can conveniently provide digital asset services and remain integrated with the wider web3 economy.\n\nOnce we have engaging web3 protocols, people from diverse demographics will start joining the crypto world.\n\nQ. Who do you think will be the primary driver of crypto adoption in the next decade? Can you elaborate on the reasons?\n\nI think the digital asset economy is conducive for people of all age groups and across geographical borders.\n\nIf you look at statistical reports, there has been an almost 200% growth in global crypto users with Asian and African countries dominating the Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nBut once you probe further, you’ll see that young people are the main drivers in the crypto space and will continue to do so.\n\nA Coinbase report states that 31% of young people own crypto compared to just 12% of older people. Further, 38% of youth believe that crypto is the future of finance compared to 28% of the older generation.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Millennials and Gen Z prefer crypto assets. To begin with, they’re digital natives who organically grew up with the Internet. But other socio-economic factors are working as well.\n\nMillennials have faced student debts, rising housing costs, inflation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, rather than trusting centralized banks or government-backed national currencies, they’re more open to alternative finance like crypto.\n\nThe Great Wealth Transfer will happen over the next few decades where Millennials and Gen Z will inherit around $84 trillion. A Galaxy Research report states that $160-$225 billion would come into crypto markets from younger generations if the Wealth Transfer happened today.\n\nWhen the Transfer is complete by 2045, crypto can record a daily incremental buying pressure of around $20-$28 million.\n\nThat is why I’m building Websea, a digital asset ecosystem that specifically focuses on young investors.\n\nQ. Tell us more about Websea. How do you intend to cater to a young audience with your platform?\n\nWebsea is a digital asset trading platform exclusively customized for the global youth.\n\nOur platform offers a dual account system with centralized and decentralized asset custody models. We have an integrated AI system for risk mitigation, fraud prevention, predictive trading analytics, and strategy recommendations.\n\nThe WBS token powers our Websea platform. WBS has a total supply of 300 million tokens with 60% allocated for community incentives. The rest is for long-term platform development with a multi-year lock-up period.\n\nWe follow an X-To-Earn tokenomics model where users can play, trade, browse, stake, contribute, and create to earn tokens.\n\nTo answer your second question, Websea offers gamified features for an engaging and entertaining trading experience for our young audience.\n\nWe also have options like Boost to Bargain, Invitation Red Packet rewards, Lucky Box awards, and Group Boosts. These financial incentives help us consolidate our platform and organically expand our user base.\n\nWebsea is also focussing on building a gaming ecosystem to cater to the youth and will incubate GameFi projects.\n\nQ. We’re currently going through a bull market where hype and speculation dominate crypto trading. However, the bear market brings a huge slump. So what do you think about this cycle and its impact on the crypto trading industry? How do you think the youth will shape this space in the coming years?\n\nI consider that the bull market hype brings new investors to the crypto industry. So there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with speculative trading during a bull run. Plus, the stock market also goes through cycles so it’s only natural for the crypto market to go through the same.\n\nLet me explain this with an example. The Runes hype has brought huge attention to Bitcoin and will provide an impetus to Bitcoin DeFi in the long run. However, as of April, two-thirds of the top 50 Runes are in the red, which means investors are not seeing any immediate profits.\n\nPeople usually blame young investors for having fun with memecoins and making the crypto space akin to gambling. But even Vitalik Buterin thinks such practices are not entirely bad.\n\nHe recently said, “If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version…?”\n\nI’ll echo Buterin’s statement and say that young investors know what they’re doing and how they want to manage their finances. So even if they’re having fun with meme coins or investing seriously in BTC or ETH, they know the game.\n\nThat is why I think the youth will drive global crypto adoption and make the web3 space more valuable and utility-driven in the future.\n\n\n\nImage: Websea Medium Blog\n\n",

    "content": "Ethereum price is again moving higher above the $3,800 resistance. ETH is now consolidating near $3,850 and is eyeing an upside break above $4,000 in the near term.\n\nEthereum price remained stable above the $3,540 support zone. ETH formed a base, outperformed Bitcoin, and started another increase above the $3,650 level.\n\nThere was a move above the $3,750 resistance. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,944 swing high to the $3,530 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum price is trading above $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,944 swing high to the $3,530 low.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $3,880 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,920 level. An upside break above the $3,920 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $4,000, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $4,080 level.\n\nIf there is a clear move above the $4,080 level, the price might rise and test the $4,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $4,350 resistance zone.\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,880 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $3,735 zone. A clear move below the $3,735 support might push the price toward $3,630. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,540 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is still above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level – $3,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $3,880\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin whales have continued to show their resilience and unwavering bullishness on the flagship crypto as it retraces.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin whales have continued to show their resilience and unwavering bullishness on the flagship crypto. This category of investors has accumulated a significant amount of the crypto token in the last seven days amid heightened volatility in Bitcoin’s price.\n\nData from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have combined to accumulate 20,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) over the past seven days. This accumulation coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price surge above $70,000.\n\nFurthermore, these whales’ purchases suggest that volume is picking up for the flagship crypto, which could help trigger more price rallies. Moreover, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in a recent market report that the selling pressure on Bitcoin was declining. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price looks primed to take off sooner rather than later with significant buys like the one made by these whales.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional investors are also back in the fold and look to be doubling their bets on the flagship crypto. This is evident in the fact that inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have picked up over the last two weeks. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds have taken in almost $800 million in this week alone.\n\nCrypto analyst James Check (also known as Checkmatey) noted in a recent market report that these funds could lead the next wave of demand, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high (ATH). These Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already been instrumental to Bitcoin’s growth this year, with the flagship crypto hitting its current ATH of $73,750 earlier in March.\n\nLike Check, crypto analyst Gustavo Faria also noted in a recent blog post that there are signs that a new wave of demand is emerging. This has raised the possibility of the next rally happening even sooner than expected. Crypto analysts like BitQuant have provided insights into how high Bitcoin could rise on its next leg up, predicting that the crypto token will reach $95,000.\n\nOn-chain analytics platform Santiment suggested there was no need to worry about any price correction for Bitcoin as the bulls have enough capital to buy up these dips. The platform highlighted that the amount of non-empty stablecoin wallets is rising, indicating that more whales are loading up their bags to invest in the crypto market.\n\nSpecifically, USDC non-empty wallets have grown by over 13%, and Tether non-empty wallets have grown by over 15%. This figure is expected to keep rising as the bull run progresses later in the year.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\n",
