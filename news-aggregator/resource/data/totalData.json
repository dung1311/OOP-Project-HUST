    "title": "Governance: Blockchain Tech\u0027s Greatest Problem\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Determining how a blockchain network is governed may be the most important factor toward success.\n\n",
    "content": "On paper, blockchain technology seems to be ironclad. An online distributed ledger that is entirely self-governed, immutable, anonymous and secure, there are near-limitless potential applications for the new technology. However, a crucial step in the development of any blockchain is the creation of governance mechanisms.\n\nThis aspect of blockchain, whose responsibility lies with the founders and developers of any particular project or network, is perhaps the greatest predictor of a particular chain\u0027s success or failure. While many developers have a good idea of what blockchain governance is and how they would like it to operate, achieving these goals is sometimes significantly more challenging.\n\nConsensus Between Users\n\nBlockchain governance requires not just consensus achieved by validating nodes, but also consensus between users on the network as well. One of the first projects to bring the idea of blockchain governance to light was Dash. In the case of Dash, a network of masternodes helped to achieve these goals. Operators of masternodes are able to vote on budget proposals, providing members of the community with the greatest stake in the project with a system for making decisions and reaching agreement on new developments.\n\nDash\u0027s model has proved useful for many other cryptocurrency projects, although each is somewhat different. Sometimes, a developer will add voting rights into the token as well, providing holders with the opportunity to be a part of the governance process and helping to ramp up incentives for use as well. While this is a straightforward and, some might argue, slapdash effort at harnessing the power of blockchain, other projects seek to be more innovative in their governance structures.\n\nIn the Interest of the Community\n\nParticularly in the case of highly successful cryptocurrency projects, it can be tough to find mechanisms for governance that will encourage voters to act in the common interests instead of self-interest. Storecoin may be one of the more interesting projects in this regard. Chris McCoy, the project\u0027s creator, says that there are four separate branches that check and balance each other on protocol-level, key people, and monetary policy decisions for the cryptocurrency imitating the U.S. Constitution. McCoy explains that blockchains need an enterprise-grade governance [model] that is trusted, enforceable and reaches finality in a democratic process. Storecoin has yet to break into the mainstream of the digital currency world, but its governance strategy is distinctiveEOS is another project that aimed to channel the U.S. Constitution in its governance procedures. However, following pushback from the broader digital currency community, founder Dan Larimer was forced to return to the drawing board in search of a new model. In 2021, he resigned from Block.one due to concerns about censorship in the industry. MakerDAO is another project that aims to harness a \"governance risk framework\" in order to diversify trust in trustless ecosystems.\n\nCryptocurrency project Tezos also illustrates a potential pitfall of governance models as well: human users. When Tezos launched in 2018, it claimed to innovate in the area of governance, promising \"a formal process through which stakeholders can efficiently govern the protocol and implement future innovations.\" However, bitter fights between Tezos foundation members crippled the project early on, forcing developers to re-examine their structures and goals.\n\nInterestingly, the largest digital currency in the world does not have a governance model like the ones above. Bitcoin was designed without any type of governance in this sense, and the project has continued to see success in a truly decentralized fashion. While some may argue that this is evidence against the need for governance, others are likely to suggest that, with a healthy governance system, the bitcoin project could be even more successful than it has been. Undoubtedly, the debates over whether and how to enact governance mechanisms for cryptocurrency projects will continue so long as the space itself remains active.\n\n",

    "content": "Even if bitcoin and the cryptocurrency trend turns out to be a massive bubble, the technology that supports the new sector may be here to stay. Blockchain technology has already seen many broad applications in areas separate from cryptocurrency, according to a report by CoinSpeaker. (See also: 6 Ways Cryptocurrencies Make the World a Better Place.)Now, one of the oldest and most staid sectors in the financial world – healthcare – may see fundamental changes as a result of the technology.\n\nSecurity, Data, Networking\n\nAs an industry, healthcare may be primed for disruption by a technology like blockchain. The industry is, by nature, closely linked with some of the facets that distributed ledgers and smart contracts were designed to enhance. These include security restrictions, shareable data, networking, and consistent, reliable service.\n\nWhile traditional models of infrastructure have worked to bring the healthcare industry to where it is today, many analysts see these systems as expensive, outdated, and susceptible to failure. Old technology systems that are put to the test by increasing amounts of data and stringent industry standards have not served to improve patient care, the argument goes.\n\nConsulting firm Deloitte believes that \"blockchain technology has the potential to transform healthcare, placing the patient at the center of the healthcare ecosystem and increasing the security, privacy, and interoperability of health data.\"ICOs Linked to Health Care Proliferate\n\nICOs, the initial coin offering launches which have become the trendy new way to launch blockchain-based startups, are increasingly focused on health care products and services. There are already many other healthcare-focused digital tokens and coins which have been launched in the past year, and ICO alert suggests that many more are on the way.\n\nOne of these upcoming launches, called BlockMedX, aims to address the rampant opioid crisis in the U.S. The service is designed to be used by physicians and pharmacies to help increase security and accountability in the prescription drug industry. BlockMedX analyzes millions of prescriptions to find concerns, helping to protect patients in the process. (See also: Can Blockchain Make Medications Cheaper and Safer?)Dentacoin, a cryptocurrency which launched last fall and which has a market cap of nearly $2 billion, aims to revitalize the dental industry, making changes to directories, review board procedures, and payment systems.\n\nMedicalchain, on the other hand, uses blockchain technology to store and share health records securely, allowing for easy and safe transfer of information between providers and patients.\n\nThese are just a small sample of some of the new ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are in the works and which could shake up the health care sector. Will every new launch upend the existing industry? That\u0027s unlikely. However, if even a few successfully take hold, the health care world in the years to come may look dramatically different from the one of a few years ago, or even of the one today.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Amid the dynamically changing state of blockchains and distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms ensure that only the true state of the system is maintained.\n\nA consensus mechanism is any method used to achieve agreement, trust, and security across a decentralized computer network. In the context of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) are two of the most prevalent consensus mechanisms. Consensus mechanisms play an essential part in securing information by using automated group verification.\n\nData and computer scientists such as Moni Naor, Cynthia Dwork, Adam Beck, Nick Szabo, and many others worked on and contributed to developing networked consensus mechanisms.\n\nProof of History (PoH) was developed by the Solana Project. It is similar to Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which encodes the passage of time cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nA consensus mechanism is the programming and process used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger\u0027s state or the state of a data set. Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledgers benefit from their use because consensus mechanisms replace much slower and sometimes inaccurate or untrustworthy human verifiers and auditors.\n\nHistory of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhen computers and networks began gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, shared databases were created so that multiple users could access the information they stored. Most had a centralized database with permissions that users accessed from different workstations. This setup evolved into centralized networks with administrators who granted user rights and maintained the integrity of the data.\n\nSome of these shared databases developed into programs that distributed storage and processing power across a network of storage devices in different locations. One of the most significant issues that needed addressing was that of preventing data tampering and unauthorized access, whether it was malicious or not. A method to automate distributed database management was required to ensure data was not changed.\n\nThis need led to the creation of distributed autonomous consensus, where programs on a network agreed on a database\u0027s state using cryptographic techniques. Agreement was designed to be reached using encryption algorithms to create long strings of alphanumeric numbers—called a hash—which were then verified by programs running on the network. A hash only changes if the information input into the hashing algorithm is changed, so the programs were designed to compare hashes to ensure they matched.\n\nWhen each program running on the network created a matching alphanumeric string, the data was said to be agreed upon by consensus of the network. Thus, consensus mechanisms were made, with credit generally given to Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin creator. However, many people worked on consensus mechanisms for years before Nakamoto released the whitepaper that made Bitcoin famous.\n\nTypes of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nThere are different kinds of consensus mechanisms, each of which works on different principles.\n\nProof of work (PoW) is a common consensus mechanism used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. It requires a participant node to prove that the work done and submitted by them was valid and a large network of programs to verify it. However, the Bitcoin consensus mechanism requires high energy consumption and long processing times.\n\nProof of stake (PoS) is another common consensus mechanism that evolved as a low-cost, low-energy-consuming alternative to PoW. It involves allocating responsibility in proposing new blocks to a participant node in proportion to the number of virtual currency tokens held. The rest of the network then verifies the block and adds it to the blockchain if consensus is reached.\n\nHowever, this approach has the drawback that it incentivizes hoarding instead of spending.\n\nWhile PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms. Proof of Capacity (PoC) allows contributing nodes to share storage space. The more hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger. Proof of Activity (PoA), used on the Decred blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. Proof of Burn (PoB) requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect \"burning\" them out of existence.\n\nThe Future of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nResearchers have been experimenting with consensus mechanisms since they became popular to try and find ways to scale blockchains securely while keeping them decentralized. To this end, there are several consensus mechanisms in use, most of which fail to provide enhancements to security, scalability, and decentralization. Rather, one of these factors is generally sacrificed to improve one or two of the others—even on the blockchains that claim to have \"solved\" this trilemma.\n\nTo address this lingering \"blockchain trilemma\" issue, some researchers are proposing artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) enabled blockchains and consensus mechanisms. There are myriad proposed methods for implementing AI/ML into blockchains—some use clusters of mobile nodes and AI/ML to manage the nodes, while others discuss using existing consensus mechanisms to train AI/ML-enabled consensus algorithms.\n\nMany of these are being developed to address three issues: first, to create fair reward models; second, to reduce their environmental impact; and third, to increase their speed without sacrificing security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nIf developers have their say (which they likely will because they\u0027re the ones creating this technology), the current state of cryptocurrencies and blockchains is not what it will eventually be—but what it all will turn into is another unknown.\n\nSimilar to all technological developments, Bitcoin and other existing blockchain systems will likely become outdated as advances are made—researchers are already proposing quantum state-based consensus protocols in addition to AI-enhanced ones. The next obvious step is AI-enhanced quantum state-based consensus blockchains and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsensus mechanisms have become an essential aspect of distributed ledgers, databases, and blockchains because much of the world is becoming more digital. Ownership of physical assets is being tokenized on ledgers and blockchains, people without access to financial services have access through blockchains, and businesses need data security more than ever.\n\nConsensus mechanisms verify data inputs and outputs, which translates to automatically auditing the digital transactions that are common today—without human oversight or intervention. They create an environment where you don\u0027t need to trust that the other party in a transaction is honest because these programs ensure the information is unalterable and secure.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "content": "Blockchain, the online ledger technology technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions, could get a boost from the recent data scandal facing tech giants such as Facebook Inc. (FB), according to one analyst on the Street. This week, Facebook saw billions of dollars wiped from its market capitalization after news broke that political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had used the personal information of more than 50 million users without their consent to help the Trump campaign in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves suggested that Zuckerberg\u0027s woes could be good news for blockchain technology. The RBC analyst indicated that decentralized blockchain will allow users to see exactly which data are being shared and with whom, but will not be able to prevent the misuse of data.\n\nInstead of giving photos over to Facebook, Steves stated that with blockchain, people would instead share data like photos specifically with people, maintaining the ability to track it and make sure it is not shared with someone who gets access to their information. (See also: Bitcoin Will Become World’s ‘Single Currency’: Dorsey.)Deception and Decentralization\n\n\"You can 100% track all this stuff,\" said the RBC analyst. \"I think that\u0027s where we\u0027re going long term.\" Steves noted that while blockchain would solve the transparency issue, allowing users to keep tabs on their data and how it gets shared, it would not solve the control issue, failing to prevent misuse in the first place.\n\nSteves expects cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology to skyrocket to a $10 trillion industry in the next 15 years, boosted by the proliferation of decentralized computing and open source software.\n\nPerhaps ironically, Facebook banned cryptocurrency ads on its platform to curb \"deceptive promotional practices\" in January. Facebook\u0027s CEO and founder spoke out regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal for the first time on Wednesday, indicating that he is \"really sorry\" and that he is \"happy\" to testify in front of Congress.\n\nThe decentralized nature and anonymity offered by the cryptocurrency space also comes with risks, causing governments around the world to double down on efforts to control the high flying space. This week, news broke that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has made it a top priority since 2013 to monitor the bitcoin blockchain in efforts to help track down senders and receivers of bitcoin. As part of a larger counterterrorism push, the NSA\u0027s bitcoin surveillance project analyzed global internet traffic and used unnamed software to \"look at organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move and launder money.\" (See also: Why The Facebook-Google Digital Duopoly May Be Dead.)Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "content": "Amber Baldet, the former head of JPMorgan \u0026 Co.’s (JPM) blockchain program, has announced her new venture—a decentralized app store for businesses. Baldet teamed up with Patrick Nielsen, who was part of her team at Quorum, to create the new framework, which is called Clovyr.\n\n“It is not an ICO. It is not a platform. It is not a new blockchain,” Baldet clarified during an announcement at the recently concluded Consensus conference. Instead, Clovyr is a framework for decentralized applications aimed at businesses and individuals. In addition to this, it also has open-source tools for developers to create new applications. (See also: JPMorgan Has Big Plans for Blockchain.)Speaking at the launch, Baldet described Clovyr as an “open ecosystem” that is “blockchain agnostic,” meaning that it is intended to facilitate transfer of value across multiple blockchains. “Clovyr is about decentralized networks growing together,” she said. To start with, Clovyr will support both public and private versions of ethereum.\n\nWhy Clovyr?\n\nExplaining the rationale behind their decision to target a varied set of audiences, Nielsen said both individuals and businesses faced several headaches in understanding and integrating decentralized applications. “Right now, there’s no way to keep data private at its point of origin and also enable big data analytics, but there could be,” he said in a press release. At the launch announcing his new venture, Nielsen provided additional context. “The cost of innovation (for businesses and individuals) is just too high,” he said.\n\nBy combining the benefits of private and public blockchains, Clovyr is intended to reduce that cost and, also, help individuals and businesses get their feet wet in the technology. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Baldet provided historical context regarding the current debate about private permissioned blockchains and the public cloud to one that occurred during the evolution of a public cloud.\n\n“When public cloud started to be a thing, a lot of businesses said, Oh, cloud, it’s a great idea architecturally, but we’re going to go ahead and build our own private cloud internally, because it’s safer and we know what we need. Now they’re spending millions of dollars to undo a lot of that work in an attempt to migrate to the public clouds that have evolved to the point where they are secure and robust and connected,” she said. Clovyr is raising funds currently and plans to launch a beta version later this year.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A Merkle root contains information about every single transaction hash that ever was on a particular block in a blockchain.\n\nA Merkle root is a simple mathematical way to verify the data on a Merkle tree. Merkle roots are used in cryptocurrency to make sure data blocks passed between peers on a peer-to-peer network are whole, undamaged, and unaltered. Merkle roots are central to the computation required to maintain cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Merkle Root?\n\nA Merkle root is the hash of all the hashes of all the transactions that are part of a block in a blockchain network.\n\nUnderstanding a Merkle Root\n\nA blockchain is comprised of various blocks that are linked with one another (hence the name blockchain). A hash tree, or the Merkle tree, encodes the blockchain data in an efficient and secure manner. It enables the quick verification of blockchain data, as well as quick movement of large amounts of data from one computer node to the other on the peer-to-peer blockchain network.\n\nEvery transaction occurring on the blockchain network has a hash associated with it. However, these hashes are not stored in a sequential order on the block, rather in the form of a tree-like structure such that each hash is linked to its parent following a parent-child tree-like relation.\n\nSince there are numerous transactions stored on a particular block, all the transaction hashes in the block are also hashed, which results in a Merkle root.\n\nFor example, consider a seven-transaction block. At the lowest level (called the leaf-level), there will be four transaction hashes. At the level one above the leaf-level, there will be two transaction hashes, each of which will connect to two hashes that are below them at the leaf level. At the top (level two), there will be the last transaction hash called the root, and it will connect to the two hashes below it (at level one).\n\nEffectively, you get an upside-down binary tree, with each node of the tree connecting to only two nodes below it (hence the name \"binary tree\"). It has one root hash at the top, which connects to two hashes at level one, each of which again connects to the two hashes at level three (leaf-level), and the structure continues depending upon the number of transaction hashes.\n\nThe hashing starts at the lowest level (leaf-level) nodes, and all four hashes are included in the hash of nodes that are linked to it at level one. Similarly, hashing continues at level one, which leads to hashes of hashes reaching to higher levels, until it reaches the single top root hash.\n\nThis root hash is called the Merkle root, and due to the tree-like linkage of hashes, it contains all the information about every single transaction hash that exists on the block. It offers a single-point hash value that enables validating everything present on that block.\n\nFor example, if one has to verify a transaction that claims to have come from block #137, they only needs to check the block\u0027s Merkle tree, without worrying about verifying anything on any other blocks on the blockchain, like block #136 or block #138.\n\nEnter the Merkle root, which further speeds up verification. Since it carries all the information about the entire tree, one only needs to verify that transaction hash, its sibling-node (if it exists), and then proceed upward until it reaches the top.\n\nEssentially, the Merkle tree and Merkle root mechanism significantly reduce the levels of hashing to be performed, enabling faster verification and transactions.\n\n",

    "content": "Streamlining \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) processes is among the key benefits of blockchain for the financial services industry. The distributed ledger functions as a common repository for client transaction activity history, and it is now being tested for KYC use.\n\nA consortium consisting of a Singapore government body and several banks, including HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MTU), has completed a \"proof-of-concept\" for a KYC blockchain. According to reports, it is the ASEAN region\u0027s first ever proof-of-concept for use of blockchain in a KYC project. The prototype was tested between February and May 2017 and worked without problems, even during \"high-volume\" information flows. In addition, it was secure and \"resistant to third-party intervention.\" (See also: Banks Claim They\u0027re Building Blockchains. They\u0027re Not.)The Singapore government is among an increasing number of organizations testing the utility of blockchain in streamlining KYC processes. For example, consulting firm Deloitte developed KYCStart (pronounced as Kick Start) earlier this year. The application claims to reduce onboarding and ongoing monitoring costs. Similarly, financial services firm R3 developed a proof-of-concept for a KYC registry for customer due diligence and determining a valid identity. For its part, Singapore, which already has a thriving financial services industry, is positioning itself as a hub for fintech innovation, and the current project puts it in a leadership position within Asia.\n\n\"Know Your Customer\" regulations are expensive and cumbersome for banks but are necessary to meet Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. A 2014 Deloitte study put the cost of AML at $10 billion. Blockchain offers a solution through its distributed ledger, which can be used to avoid duplication of effort between member banks and provides a common database of client transaction history. It can also help weed out criminal activity. For example, startups such as Chainanalysis and Identity Mind mine blockchain to identify transaction patterns.\n\n",

    "title": "4 Blockchain Contenders in Competition with Ethereum\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Ethereum remains the gold standard for smart contracts and blockchain-based apps, but new challengers are springing up.\n\n",
    "content": "The advent of Ethereum created a new paradigm in a still-young blockchain industry and shifted its focus away from cryptocurrencies as financial tools and toward a more utilitarian purpose. With smart contracts on Ethereum and similar blockchains, processes that involve some transaction of data can achieve autonomy while remaining irrefutable and transparent. Startups and mature firms alike have developed ways to use smart contracts to build low-overhead work flows, and creatives are using them in their innovations as well.\n\nA recent project on Ethereum’s platform called Crypto Kitties was the talk of the community for many reasons. The idea behind Crypto Kitties is that people can use Ethereum to trade and breed virtual pet cats via smart contract, which results in some interesting and rare “cattributes.” The more uncommon a cat’s trait, the more it’s worth in ETH.\n\nDespite the novelty of the idea, or perhaps because of it, the simple game exploded in popularity. It temporarily managed to take over 13% of traffic on Ethereum’s blockchain through the Crypto Kitties smart contract. The event slowed down Ethereum significantly and revealed some daunting problems facing its scaling efforts. (See more: CryptoKitties Are Still a Thing. Here\u0027s Why.)Ethereum’s Achilles Heel\n\nEthereum has a long road ahead if it wants to achieve its ambition of becoming the world’s “decentralized computer.\" Even Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, doubts its current ability to scale, saying, “Scalability [currently] sucks; the blockchain design fundamentally relies on bottlenecks where individual nodes must process every single transaction in the entire network.”He’s correct. The Ethereum blockchain keeps getting bigger, and exhibits an increasingly large footprint for the hardware of miners and users alike. Additionally, its relatively outdated algorithmic programming makes inefficient use of the chain’s processing power, and returns a dismal number of transactions per second. This is a problem for businesses who rely on Ethereum smart contracts and impacts its future applicability and price. Fortunately, there are other smart contract platforms built on blockchain that are working to evolve the concept further.\n\n1. QTUM\n\nOne of the most promising contenders for Ethereum’s title is QTUM, a hybrid cryptocurrency technology that takes the best attributes of bitcoin and Ethereum before blending them together. The result is a solution that resembles bitcoin core, but also includes an Abstract Accounting Layer that gives QTUM’s blockchain smart contract functionality via a more robust x86 Virtual Machine.\n\nEssentially this is an off-layer scaling solution akin to what bitcoin seeks in SegWit and the Lightning Network, combined with the ability to build and host smart contracts. This has made QTUM a popular destination for developers, who appreciate the protective clauses installed in the platform that make it nigh impossible to commit the kinds of coding infractions that might one day become a multi-million-dollar problem. They also appreciate the presence of second-layer storage, despite its implications on decentralization, because stable business applications are their primary desire, as well they should be.\n\n2. Ethereum Classic\n\nThe first hard fork that the cryptocurrency community witnessed was Ethereum forking from Ethereum Classic in 2013, which created a new prototype with ambitions to fill the gaps in Ethereum’s code. The controversy surrounded a hack where one individual stole over $50 million in ETH from a smart contract that was holding them in escrow as part of the original DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) project.\n\nAfter the hacker created a glitch that withdrew ETH from users instead of depositing it, the community voted to create a new chain that was backwards-compatible with the old one, so that mistakes like these could be reversed, and coins returned to their rightful owners. The hard fork installed a new update to the old Ethereum’s code which made it impossible to backtrack, even in the case of heinous breaches, of which there have been several. Ethereum Classic is continually being upgraded in this manner, thanks to a vibrant and active community, and keeps on pace with other projects despite its age.\n\n3. NEO\n\nNEO is what people like to refer to as “China’s Ethereum,” and for good reason. First, the two are very similar, and bill themselves as hosts of decentralized applications (dApps), ICOs, and smart contracts. They’re both open source, but while Ethereum is supported by a democratic foundation of developers, NEO has the full backing of China’s government. This has made it popular domestically but also abroad, and for its unique value proposition as well.\n\nNEO uses a more energy-efficient consensus mechanism called dBFT (decentralized Byzantium Fault Tolerant) instead of proof-of-work, making it much faster at a rate of 10,000 transactions per second. Moreover, it supports more computer languages than Ethereum. People can build dApps with Java, C#, and soon Python and Go, making this option accessible to startups with big ideas while helping to add to its long-term viability.\n\n4. Cardano\n\nOne of the newest entries into the smart contract platform contest, Cardano is a dual-layer solution, but with a unique twist. The platform has a unit of account and a control layer that governs the use of smart contracts, recognizes identity, and maintains a degree of separation from the currency it supports.\n\nCardano is programmed in Haskell, a language best suited for business applications and data analysis, making its future applications likely to be financial or organizational. This ideal blend of public sector usability and privacy protection makes Cardano a potentially groundbreaking solution, but it’s still very young. While the developer team’s use of deliberate, airtight scientific methodology make progress slow, it will likely be void of any parity or security mistakes that are an unfortunate reality in its more haphazardly assembled peers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite its issues, Ethereum remains the gold standard for smart contracts and blockchain-based apps. These new challengers all offer exciting value propositions, but they must also prove capable of attracting a wide enough user base to allow for mainstream adoption and success.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A recent study revealed that child pornography, or links to such materials, might be housed within the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "Besides their seemingly enormous potential for profit by everyday investors, cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks also have a seedier appeal as well. The anonymity provided by decentralized networks has enticed criminals of various sorts; some currencies and exchanges have been plagued by hacks and other nefarious activity. Now, a report by Cointelegraph suggests that a study from Germany\u0027s Goethe and Aachen Universities has unearthed eight files that show or link to sexual content, hidden within the blockchain for bitcoin, the world\u0027s largest cryptocurrency. There have been allegations that some of these image might link to child pornography, but Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told Cointelegraph that any links to child porn sites were found to be dead links.\n\nQuestion of Ownership and Responsibility\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of bitcoin and the structure of the blockchain which undergirds it, determining ownership and responsibility for the illegal content is difficult, at best. Ultimately, the report suggests, \"any user that has a bitcoin full node is in possession of data that could potentially lead to criminal prosecution.\" A number of media outlets have moved quickly to criticize the broader blockchain community for this content. Nonetheless, Coin Telegraph suggests that there are important technical considerations regarding the structure of the blockchain to keep in mind.\n\nCan Content Be Removed?\n\nTodd commented on questions of ownership of the material and next steps. He suggested that the risk of the average user accessing the particular material in question is small, suggesting that \"you need special decoding tools to be able to extract the data and make sense of it.\"Todd also acknowledges that the bitcoin protocol was not built to publish data. As he told Cointelegraph: \"The tools in question make use of the unavoidable fact that any publicly auditable ledger that the public can interact with can also be leveraged to publish data. This is an unavoidable fact of life, because the entire purpose of being publicly auditable is to distribute data so the public can verify it.\"Todd continues by suggesting that adding a prohibitive cost for publishing data could be a deterrent to this type of content in the future. However, because of the immutability of the transactions on the blockchain, meaning that transactions which have been verified cannot be changed, the content cannot be removed. However, the illicit links are dead and they are effectively blocked to the public by deep levels of encryption. Regardless, this particular case may have a significant impact on future developments in the blockchain space, as new networks make efforts to neutralize this issue.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "summary": "Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world\u0027s largest asset management firm, said the company was a \"student of blockchain\".\n\n",
    "content": "The world’s biggest asset manager, Blackrock Inc. (BLK) may be getting into cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology, blockchain. According to Financial News, the company has set up a team from different parts of its business to investigate cryptocurrencies. Blackrock’s chief executive officer, Larry Fink, said it had set up a working group to investigate blockchain and cryptocurrencies. “We are a big student of blockchain,” he told Reuters. He did not express similar sentiments about cryptocurrencies, though, saying that he does not see “huge demand” for them from investors. Fink had earlier called bitcoin “an index of money laundering” and said that it was a “speculative” investment. Blackrock is also on record as having said that it was “monitoring” cryptocurrencies and blockchain. (See also: Blackrock Keeping Cryptocurrencies On Its Radar).\n\nIn May of this year, three Blackrock analysts left the firm and started a $20 million venture capital fund Eterna Capital. Their aim was to attract institutional investors to cryptocurrencies. According to them, institutional investors are wary of risking their reputation by investing in or offering services related to cryptocurrencies. Apart from unremitting volatility, tales of market manipulation by bitcoin whales and hacks have garnered an unsavory reputation for cryptocurrencies. (See also: Why Did Bitcoin Whales Sell $100 Million Of Crypto).\n\nBitcoin Price Moves Up\n\nBitcoin’s price moved up in response to news of Blackrock’s interest in blockchain. It jumped by 6% to $6739 this morning before inching downward again. The original cryptocurrency is down by more than 50% since the beginning of this year due to negative sentiment about cryptocurrencies and selloff by major investors. At 14:43 UTC, bitcoin was trading at $6,694.70, unchanged from its price 24 hours ago.\n\nBlackrock manages $6.3 trillion in assets. An endorsement or move by the firm to either invest in cryptocurrencies or utilize blockchain technology could result in significant mainstream traction for both. Other asset management firms, such as Fidelity Investments, have already conducted several tests to assess blockchain’s applications to their industry. Possible application areas for the technology in asset management include smart contracts and decentralized trading networks.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "title": "Blockchain Is Changing How Dating Apps Work\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "As cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology become more popular, blockchain-based dating apps are taking off.\n\n",
    "content": "In its relatively short existence, online dating has gone from being a highly stigmatized way to meet people to the default strategy for locating dates among younger, and even older, generations. Older models based on sites like eHarmony have given way to gamified systems like Tinder and its contemporaries, but the equation has remained mostly unchanged. Users create profiles intended to exhibit the best possible impression (sometimes to the point of exaggeration or lying) before other users make selections based on limited information if they are interested.\n\nThe industry is undoubtedly in a boom after millions of new users flocked to join online dating services in recent years, but it is not without its headwinds. Most of the existing apps, including major names like Tinder and Bumble, create little incentive for honesty, rewarding those whose profile looks best, and not the most transparent. Moreover, people don’t magically become extroverts online, and for some users finding a match is still a challenging process.\n\nNevertheless, the industry continues to evolve, and new startups are introducing blockchain into the equation in an attempt to overcome some of these hurdles. The technology allows for creative models that shift incentives, and by using many of its inherent advantages, startups are building on an already popular foundation to produce an even better experience for all users.\n\nThe Transparency Problem\n\nOne of the biggest issues dating apps face — and a problem that has existed since inception — is honesty. In the real world, people have fewer chances to lie about certain aspects of their identities, especially in relation to physical appearance and other easily verifiable details.\n\nOnline, users must display a certain degree of blind trust, assuming that the person interacted with is truthful, an aspect in application-based dating that isn\u0027t always a given. The main issue here is the lack of an incentive to be transparent.\n\nThe goal for most people on apps like Tinder is to identify as many matches as possible, an objective that lends itself poorly to honesty. Users are less likely to post an accurate photo or description of themselves if they perceive it to be harmful to their dating opportunities. Apps have made attempts to punish users, but there is no real mechanism to prevent the problem in the first place. Blockchain, on the other hand, has a ready-made solution designed to address the problem.\n\nBlockchain technology is built on the idea of full transparency and immutability, two factors that play a large role in verifying users’ identities while maintaining the option of privacy. Because users can freely share information which will remain anonymous, but which is easy to verify on a chain, identities are thereby easier to validate. Companies like Viola and Hicky have both implemented blockchain solutions that increase transparency by requiring users to verify their identities.\n\nMore importantly, blockchain helps companies offer strong incentives for good behavior such as undergoing a verification process or adding more details to a profile. This in turn promotes a more transparent ecosystem that lets users feel confident while avoiding scams, fraud, and dishonest users. (See also: Beware of these Five Bitcoin Scams.)Improving the Matchmaking Process\n\nThe other problem for many users is actually finding a match. Despite the fast-rising popularity of the online dating scene, many people still rely on their real-world social networks to find a match, a feature most dating apps have yet to incorporate. The issue in this case is a lack of clear incentives for helping others find a match. In the real world, friends, family, and colleagues may help others find a date for altruistic reasons, but among strangers that is less common.\n\nOnline, the problem results in awkward interactions, failed matches, and frustration by shier users who are unable to find a partner this way. In an ecosystem where matches have been gamified into a measure of success, this dynamic can be compounded and cause users to simply leave the app altogether.\n\nIt’s hard to ignore that some users do prefer this mode of finding a partner, and blockchain-based startups have come up with interesting solutions that could resolve the issue. Blockchain startup Ponder is one such app adding a twist to the regular dating dynamic by allowing users to participate simply as matchmakers. By employing this model, users can connect other participants whom they believe would be a good match, while others can volunteer to be matched, allowing third parties to select their potential next date.\n\nOther apps have introduced similar models, such as Matchpool, which hinge on this very situation. In both cases, users are rewarded for being helpful. Ponder awards users who match others with tokens, with the incentive to quickly earn more as they match additional users. This presents a third way for both matchers and those being matched. Instead of relying on computer algorithms or a highly gamified ecosystem, users can trust others who are motivated to succeed in matching them, as they have an incentive to work to fulfill everyone’s best interests.\n\nRedefining Dating Apps\n\nMuch of the press blockchain has received has focused on its large-scale applicability, from logistics to IoT functionality and even the broad travel industry. However, by localizing the technology to the dating industry, startups have been able to quickly target and start disentangling some of the biggest drawbacks the market has so far been unable to resolve on its own.\n\nWith new apps quickly emerging and threatening to capture market share from established companies like Match and eHarmony, the industry is faced with a real need to embrace innovation or be cannibalized by its younger visionaries. By adopting blockchain and the easy fixes it offers, dating services can improve their transparency, provide users with a more complete experience, and create incentives for honesty and good behavior.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The venture branch of IBM has been exploring blockchain for some time.\n\n",
    "content": "IBM (IBM), the worldwide technology giant, may be getting closer to making a major investment into the blockchain space. According to a report by Coin Desk, the venture wing of the tech company, IBM Ventures, has been exploring the new technology by investing \"employee time and energy\" into the space. Now, it appears that IBM Ventures is preparing to assume an equity stake in an industry startup as well. IBM Ventures is reportedly considering from among a number of candidates for possible investments at this time.\n\nSupply Chain Management and Compliance Verticals\n\nAccording to Christoph Auer-Welsbach, a partner at IBM Ventures, the company may be focused particularly on startups incorporating blockchain and which are in the supply chain management and compliance verticals. Auer-Welsbach explained that \"from a time perspective, the time already is right\" for such an investment. However, in order for IBM Ventures to be able to initiate a cash investment in a blockchain startup, a number of particular conditions must be met. First, IBM\u0027s investments need to occur between 18 months and five years after a company\u0027s maturity. Beyond that, investments by the venture wing are limited to company\u0027s providing business-to-business products. Auer-Welsbach explained that it was the last of these stipulations which has previously pushed IBM away from cryptocurrency-related companies. \"Most companies in the space are in the cryptocurrency field, which we don\u0027t see from a B2B perspective as the ultimate angle for us to add value,\" he said.\n\nIBM Has Focused on Blockchain in Other Ways\n\nBesides the various hurdles standing between IBM Ventures and investments in blockchain companies, the larger tech giant\u0027s priority has long been to promote and develop its own blockchain platforms, IBM Blockchain Platform and Hyperledger Fabric. The company has prioritized developing support for these projects over generating revenue on any related investments, for the time being.\n\nThus, companies that IBM Ventures would be likely to consider are those that have strong, proven business models and multiple clients, allowing for them to participate in the development of a sense of community. In one example, IBM Ventures recently took a position as lead investor for a $15 million round in Lightbend, a company with an open-source platform based in the Scala development language and with a number of prior corporate customers.\n\nThere have yet to be many companies which have met all of IBM\u0027s criteria, and because of that, the company has remained focused on its own project, Hyperledger Fabric. This platform allows groups of firms to develop into consortia. Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM\u0027s blockchain unit, explained that the company\u0027s investment in cloud computing was a sort of \"plumbing layer\" to support blockchain ecosystems. Regardless of where IBM ends up investing, the addition of a major tech company to the blockchain startup world is an important sign of the latter\u0027s growth and success.\n\n",

    "content": "Although it may not be a household name in various other parts of the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is nonetheless a colossal figure in the global banking scene. ICBC, founded in 1984 and, by certain metrics, the largest bank in the world, will reportedly include a greater focus on developing blockchain technology, according to its chair. Among other focal points that Chair Yi Huiman described, according to Coin Telegraph, are big data, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations.\n\nSmart Banking and Blockchain\n\nICBC has been focused on so-called \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" banking since 2017. In an effort to find use cases for smart banking, ICBC aims to improve service in the global financial world and to increase security of financial data which may be shared with third parties. Given the natural tendencies toward anonymity, immutability, and data sharing, blockchain seems like a strong tool to use in pursuit of the goal of developing smart banking technologies and applications.\n\nChinese Authorities\n\nAt the same time, though, the Chinese government remains broadly opposed to digital currencies in many ways. Since September of 2017, China has tightened regulations on digital tokens. However, authorities have been much more open to the possibilities inherent in blockchain technology; indeed, China is actively developing blockchain technology for use in many different industries. Earlier in the summer, the Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County of Sichuan Province partnered with Beijing Sinfotek Group to establish a new blockchain company designed for \"forestry economic development and industrial poverty alleviation,\" for instance. The Communist Party of China also recently released a blockchain primer which details many of the potential applications of this new technology.\n\nSpecifics about how the ICBC hopes to utilize blockchain technology in its new projects remain sparse at this time. With more than 5,000 corporate and 530 million personal customers, however, ICBC has the opportunity to dramatically impact the financial world both inside and outside of the digital currency space. If ICBC were to fully embrace blockchain technology, it would mark a crucial turning point toward the long-term and broad integration of blockchain into everyday business and life.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Proof of work is the process of validating transactions on a blockchain to confirm transactions, close a block, and open a new one.\n\nProof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires network members to expend effort in solving an encryption puzzle. Proof of work is also called mining, in reference to receiving a reward for work done. Proof of work allows for secure peer-to-peer transaction processing without needing a trusted third party. Proof of work at scale requires vast amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nProof of work (PoW) is a blockchain consensus mechanism that requires significant computing effort from a network of devices. The concept was adapted from digital tokens by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable proof of work\" using the 160-bit secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1).\n\nFollowing its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin became the first widely adopted application of Finney\u0027s PoW idea (Finney was also the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction). Proof of work is also the mechanic used in many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnderstanding Proof of Work\n\nProof of work is a concept used in some public blockchains to demonstrate that a program did the work required to propose a new block for the chain. It is commonly called a consensus mechanism because, eventually, network consensus is reached after there is proof the work was done honestly (in this case, \"honestly\" means there were no attempts to alter data).\n\nProof of work is provided by sending the information in a block through a hashing algorithm, then adjusting variable fields until a hexadecimal number is reached that has a lower value than the network\u0027s difficulty target. This serves as proof that the program expended the computational effort to \"hash\" the block until a solution was reached.\n\nProof of Work and Consensus\n\nHere\u0027s a quick rundown of the proof of work process on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nFirst, the worker, which is called a miner, creates a temporary file (a block). If it wins the competition to solve for a winning hash, this file will be stored on the blockchain. The block has the four following fields:The block header contains the following fields:The mining program assembles this block and places the transactions it has prioritized in the transaction field. It continuously adjusts the nonce and the extra nonce (which is part of the coinbase transaction in the Merkle tree) and sends the information in the block through a hashing algorithm.\n\nIt repeats this process until it finds a solution, which is a value less than or equal to the difficulty target. The difficulty target is set so that a certain number of hashes per second must be attempted before a solution is found. For example, on May 17, 2024, block 843,900 had a difficulty target of 83.148T, or 83.148 trillion attempts per second per miner.\n\nThe winning hash for that block was:000000000000000000033028b3c8296ed776653032030cd01290f4345f5a9b6eThis hash provided proof to the network that the miner did the work. The block was added to the blockchain, and the network began its process of reaching consensus.\n\nConsensus, the attribute most commonly associated with blockchain proofs, is reached after the block is closed and added to the chain. While working on proposing new blocks and generating winning hashes, each miner also validates each new block as it is added. Each miner broadcasts to the network that the block it confirmed is valid.\n\nNew blocks use the previous block\u0027s header hash, creating a chain of proof, which leads to network consensus. This is why these proofs are called consensus mechanisms—because they form the basis of how consensus is reached.\n\nProof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nThe two most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. Bitcoin\u0027s top competitor, Ethereum, used proof of work on its blockchain until September 2022, when its highly-anticipated transition to proof of stake was made. Here are some of the key differences between the two.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nProof of work mining is a competitive process, with many participants hoping for a profitable outcome. Because minable cryptocurrency has market value, businesses have emerged and overtaken most of the computational power used by proof of work blockchains.\n\nFor example, on May 17, 2024, FoundryDigital had the most hashing power on the Bitcoin network, 175 exa hashes per second (EH/s) out of a network total of 673 EH/s. Foundry Digital is owned by Digital Currency Group, a venture firm that has funded or invested in hundreds of cryptocurrency projects.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that use proof of work were designed to be used and hosted by individuals for their benefit. However, individuals have been pushed out of the processes by businesses that have centralized them for profit.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies to validate transactions on their blockchains and award tokens for participating in the network. It is a competitive process that uses publicly available transaction information to attempt to generate a hexadecimal number less than the network target for that mining period.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "summary": "The state of West Virginia is developing a blockchain-based app for voters abroad.\n\n",
    "content": "West Virginia is launching a blockchain-based voting application designed for military troops serving overseas. With the app, troops registered in the state and stationed abroad will have the opportunity to vote in the midterm elections this November, according to Bitcoin News.\n\nThe project, a partnership between the state and Boston-based blockchain project Voatz, is the first of its kind to reach this far. However, there are also several other companies intending to explore the use of mobile apps as voting systems. Given recent concerns across the U.S. about the activities of Russian hackers during the 2016 elections and heightened tension regarding voting security, blockchain-based solutions could present a helpful development.\n\nFollowing on Success of Earlier State Election\n\nEarlier this year, West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner reportedly planned to test a blockchain-based voting solution for the state\u0027s Senate primary. Assuming that this trial run proved successful, the state would allow all 55 counties to take part in the new method for the upcoming general election. Warner\u0027s office reported that no problems were found following four audits of the software and after the pilot election process took place.\n\nFor the pilot, the blockchain app was offered to military personnel from two specific counties and serving overseas. For the time being, the blockchain app will be limited to those serving abroad.\n\nBenefits of the App\n\nThe app is designed to address several of the issues caused by absentee ballots submitted by those serving overseas. One problem is the late receipt of these ballots, both by absentee voters and by the state following the submission of the ballots. This slows down the voting and tabulation processes. Another concern is voter anonymity. In each of these cases, voting by app could help to address these concerns.\n\nPushback\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there is also substantial pushback to the idea of voting via mobile app. A representative for the Center for Democracy and Technology has suggested that \"mobile voting is a horrific idea.\" While blockchain offers an immutable, public ledger that is updated in real time, thereby increasing efficiency and theoretically enhancing security, the example of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is reason enough for some to balk at the idea of blockchain app voting.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been subjected to intensive hacks, fraud and scams of various kinds. Given the critical importance of voting, as well as the tense national debate about Election Day security, some are simply not willing to introduce a dramatic change to the voting process at this time. Nonetheless, West Virginia has taken a crucial first step in applying blockchain technology to yet another area of public life in need of revision and renewal.\n\n",

    "title": "Stellar Blockchain: Overview, History, FAQ\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Stellar was among the top 30 cryptocurrencies in 2023. Here is a brief intro to this cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is a distributed ledger used to transmit digital currencies. The main token of the Stellar blockchain is Stellar lumens or XLM. The Stellar blockchain uses a consensus algorithm that is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than that of Bitcoin. The Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, who also founded Mt. Gox and co-founded Ripple. Critics say that the Stellar blockchain is centralized around the Stellar Development Foundation, which controls a large share of the lumens tokens.\n\nEach Stellar wallet must maintain a minimum balance in order to exist. At present, each account must maintain a base reserve of 1 XLM.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Stellar Blockchain?\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the hundreds of networks that store and transmit cryptocurrencies. As bitcoin garnered headlines over the past ten years, many other virtual currencies and platforms racked up impressive gains and user bases. The stellar blockchain, with its lumens token, is one of them.\n\nIn early 2021, the value of Stellar\u0027s lumen token grew more than fivefold, from $0.13 to $0.73, before collapsing over the following year. As of early 2023, the lumen token is trading for about $0.08, according to the crypto data site CoinMarketCap.\n\nUnderstanding Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar\u0027s basic operation is similar to that of most decentralized payment technologies. It runs a network of decentralized servers with a distributed ledger that is updated every two to five seconds among all nodes. The most prominent distinguishing factor between Stellar and bitcoin is its consensus protocol.\n\nStellar’s consensus protocol does not rely on the entire miner network to approve transactions. Instead, it uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm, which enables faster processing of transactions. This is because it uses quorum slices (or a portion of the network) to approve and validate a transaction.\n\nEach node in the Stellar network chooses another set of “trustworthy” nodes. Once a transaction is approved by all nodes within this set, then it is considered approved. The shortened process has made Stellar\u0027s network extremely fast and it is said to process as many as 1,000 network operations per second.\n\nHow the Stellar Blockchain Process Works\n\nThe current process for cross-border transfers is a complicated one. It requires domestic banks to maintain accounts in foreign jurisdictions in local currencies. Their correspondent banks must operate a similar account in the original country.\n\nThe Nostro-Vostro process, as it is known, for cross-border transactions with fiat currencies is a lengthy one involving conversion and reconciliation of accounts. Because it enables simultaneous validation, Stellar’s blockchain can shorten or eliminate the delays and complexity involved.\n\nStellar’s Lumens cryptocurrency can also be used to provide liquidity and streamline the process. According to some reports, banks will use their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate such transfers in the future. According to David Mazières, a Stanford University professor and SCP creator, the protocol has “modest” computing and financial requirements. This enables even organizations with minimal IT budgets, such as nonprofits, to participate in its network.\n\nHistory of Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb (pictured), who also co-founded the cryptocurrency company Ripple and the exchange Mt. Gox. After leaving Ripple over his differences with other co-founders, McCaleb and his partner Joyce Kim launched the Stellar protocol as a fork of the Ripple codebase. Payments company Stripe provided $3 million in seed funding.\n\nStellar came into the spotlight in October 2017 after it announced a partnership with IBM. The partnership envisages the setting up of multiple currency corridors among nations in the South Pacific.\n\nThe project stated a goal of processing up to 60% of all cross-border payments in the region, which includes countries like Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. This would enable connections between small businesses, non-profits, and local banking institutions to expedite commercial transactions. For example, a farmer in Samoa would be able to connect and conduct transactions with a buyer in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2016, prominent technology consulting firm Deloitte also announced a partnership with Stellar to develop a payments app. At a conference in 2017, McCaleb confirmed that 30 banks signed up to use Stellar’s blockchain for cross-border transfers.\n\nConcerns About Stellar Blockchain\n\nFollowing the launch of the Stellar protocol, many investors raised alarms about the high number of lumens tokens controlled by the Stellar Development Foundation. Rather than let Stellar nodes \"mine\" new cryptocurrency, the creators of Stellar simply created 100 billion lumens tokens. The vast majority of them were assigned to the Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nAlthough these resources are ostensibly intended to fund development and adoption, some investors worry that they could be sold on the market, thereby diluting the holdings of potential investors. In order to address these concerns, the SDF intentionally destroyed 55 billion lumens tokens in 2019.\n\nThere are also concerns that the network relies on a small number of nodes, many of them controlled by the SDF. In 2019, two of those nodes unexpectedly failed, causing the Stellar blockchain to halt for over an hour.\n\nStellar Blockchain vs. Ripple\n\nStellar is an open-source payment technology that shares several similarities with Ripple and its XRP cryptocurrency. Like Ripple, Stellar is a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers.\n\nBoth networks use similar protocols and were derived from the same codebase. In both protocols, there is no mining or algorithmic proof-of-work: All tokens were created at the moment the blockchain was launched.\n\nThe majority of XRP tokens are controlled by Ripple, a for-profit company, while the majority of lumens tokens are held by the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. While Ripple is a closed system, Stellar is open-source.\n\nThey also have different customers. Ripple works with established banking institutions and consortiums in order to streamline their cross-border transfer technology. In contrast, Stellar is focused on developing markets and has multiple use cases for its technology, including money remittances and bank loan distribution.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the thousands of competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is used for fast, cheap transactions with minimal computational or energy costs. Although it has occasionally enjoyed sharp price rises, the value of Stellar lumens has plunged with respect to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain creates a more direct, mutually-beneficial playing field for retailers and shoppers alike.\n\n",
    "content": "There is no candidate more suitable to the disruption of the retail industry than blockchain, which is notorious for altering dynamics between individuals and entities regardless of the purpose for doing so. Where the internet layers the path between brands and customers with several intermediaries, blockchain delivers a resoundingly better deal. Robust decentralized networking capabilities, plus the ability to motivate certain behavior with cryptocurrencies and tokens, means that brands can bypass middlemen and motivate customers to volunteer the information most valuable to them. More than a few companies are putting this new infrastructure to the test in the retail sector, and the best of them will help customers and brands benefit simultaneously from the new status quo.\n\nWrecking Retail Barriers\n\nEscaping traditional data-based advertising strategies means finding a connection to customer data that isn’t stratified by entrenched go-betweens, which invariably drive up costs and obfuscate campaign analytics to perpetuate their dominant model. Usually, obtaining access to customer behavioral analytics isn’t possible from sources that don’t originate with Google or Facebook. Forget that these data monopolies push irrelevant key performance indicators and obfuscate the most relevant results. They also don’t allow shoppers to be directly targeted in a retail environment even though the vast volume of money still moves through brick and mortar businesses and not eCommerce.\n\nOne of the toughest skills to achieve, and what represents the pinnacle of advertising prowess, is the ability to target shoppers while they’re physically in the aisle. Not before they get to the store, or after, but the chance to alter their perception of products while in front of them. Brands can get close to this plateau by employing location-based advertising services, but for reasons of price and accuracy, this isn’t always the most effective option. Fortunately, companies using blockchain to build innovative, retail-facing services can address these weaknesses comprehensively.\n\nShping users, for example, can earn cryptocurrency coins for scanning product barcodes with a blockchain-connected mobile application. With the app, they can learn more about the products they’re buying and add value to the ecosystem by writing reviews, giving more detailed product descriptions, learning about sourcing of ingredients, recent product recalls, active promotions and more. With users motivated to ‘shping’ as they shop, brands have a new channel that they can deploy to promote themselves. Now, advertisers can reach shoppers as they peruse a dizzying variety of goods, and help inform their decisions in real time. Information on product authenticity and origin are also obtainable. Moreover, Shping finally allows brands to gain inexpensive access to data on customer demographics, location, preferences, and past campaign interactions. The platform is all about mutual benefits, and smart, relevant marketing to shoppers who have an interest in seeing ads.\n\nOther platforms promote healthier retail dynamics and sustainability as well, such as Nucleus Vision, which uses an IoT-based blockchain to identify who the customers are that walk into any store. Using ION Sensors installed in retail stores, brands can engage with customers that are within the immediate vicinity of their products at any time, without using any applications, RFID or Bluetooth connectivity required. Developed at Harvard, Nucleus Vision is one of the lightest-weight, least adoption-dependent blockchain retail tools available. Blockchain is permeating through all sectors of the retail industry, not just in-store targeting. A pertinent example comes courtesy of Incent, an Australian marketing leader that helps brands incentivize specific customer behavior online. Instead of IoT sensors or a barcode scanner, however, the company pays INCNT tokens to users who allow their browser extension to gather data while they conduct their online shopping.\n\nRevolutions Take Time\n\nWhile these platforms are propagated by new marketing models that inflate the bottom line and offer greater accuracy, customers must be able to benefit in the same manner. While blockchain is the only technology that can offer this dual-edged utility, it still takes some skill to create a decentralized engagement platform that’s good enough to stand the test of time. The first entrants have a head start, and the architectures they’re building so far are encouraging. What’s required now is participation, meaning the companies which have now successfully launched an ICO will be using their funding to spread the word.\n\nHowever, just as shoppers show preference to the products that suit their lifestyles, they will also join the blockchain platforms that cater to their needs best. The race to revolutionize retail is on, but though the starting gun has sounded, it may take years for the new retail services sector’s winner to establish a qualifiable lead.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "In online advertising’s current paradigm, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest. Enter blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "Whether collective hosts of a remote cloud storage platform or inhabitants of a player-owned VR world, blockchain users are stakeholders in their favorite applications rather than mere customers. Whereas the internet constructed inroads between disparate service providers and content hosts, encouraging more entrepreneurship and access, it also turns its participants into clients of the “internet establishment” by default. Blockchain, on the other hand, represents a network of paths skirting the toll booths installed by these entrenched entities, to achieve better autonomy and equality.\n\nOne of the biggest industries in the world, online advertising operates on these old toll roads exclusively. Companies like Google and Yahoo broke ground in the industry first and have benefited from the internet’s centralized infrastructure to institute themselves as middlemen between advertisers and publishers. The services they provide are convenient, but they’re built on a system that is opaque enough to hide some worrisome flaws. Blockchain represents a way out for participants in the status quo, and there are some very clever companies already using it to show these people what they’re missing.\n\nTipping the Scales Back\n\nIn online advertising’s current paradigm, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest that informs the results of any advertising campaign. Advertisers need to know how their ad is performing, yet all the tools they’re given to optimize campaigns are provided by middlemen who also act as platforms where publishers and advertisers connect. Google, for example, sells ad space and illustrates the performance of ads with their Analytics dashboard as well.\n\nThe thing is, Google Analytics puts an inordinate emphasis on key performance indicators that benefit Google more than the advertiser. True indicators of ad success are obscured in favor of KPIs like click-through rate, which isn’t necessarily a signal of ad efficacy but is close to the bottom line of Google itself.\n\nAccordingly, advertisers waste money when they don’t have a transparent way to measure ad efficacy, and the unfortunate existence of bots only exacerbate the problem. These are robotic computers that artificially inflate results and give fake justification for high ad hosting costs. Google’s tools don’t separate fake engagement from real participation, and neither does it have any incentive to do so.\n\nPublishers suffer the consequences of this system as much as advertisers. From small blogs to high-volume publications, those who host ads on their site aren’t given enough of the profits, because ad giants use their biased data and oligopoly to increase their own take.\n\nFinally, users – the ones subjected to ads on their favorite website – often tolerate ads that are irrelevant to them and intrusive. They might also choose to ignore ads by abandoning the site permanently, thus harming other stakeholders. (See also: Twitter Suspending Accounts to Curb Crypto Scams.)Blockchain Rolls Out the Red Carpet\n\nBlockchain systems, on the other hand, offer a better deal. This infrastructure effectively cuts out middlemen who used to make their living matching publishers with advertisers by allowing advertisers to connect directly with relevant publishers. Publishers themselves can choose advertisers that more accurately match the content on their site.\n\nOn decentralized systems, authority is shared between network participants instead of being delegated to a single entity, which might otherwise use the responsibility to gain an advantage. Finally, the digital ledger provides an irrefutable record of how ads are performing, allowing advertisers to finally get a clearer, more granular, and less expensive analysis of their ad’s results. Though these capabilities are indeed impressive, it takes an expert touch to create a decentralized ad network to put them into practice, instead of on paper.\n\nKind Ads is a decentralized ad network that matches the best advertisers with appropriate publishers directly, eliminating platform fees for all participants. Its goal is to build stronger, more accountable connections between advertisers, publishers, consumers, and developers of decentralized apps (DApps) where ads might appear. With non-intrusive push notifications, easy opt-out tools, and multiple channels for advertisers to use, the KIND token will incentivize all contributors to engage with the ad ecosystem.\n\nIn the same way, BAT – Basic Attention Token – are looking to simplify the process of connecting ad buyers and sellers. The company’s token, and its integrated browser, let advertisers interact directly with publishers and get the information they need without sacrificing users’ privacy.\n\nWith BAT, the struggle is the necessity of their own browser to their platform, whereas Kind Ads are browser agnostic, as it is hard very to challenge Chrome, Fireox and Safari.\n\nPlatforms like these allow publishers to create content instead of messing with poorly-optimized ads, which helps users to get a better experience. It also helps advertisers, who no longer need to spend money on irrelevant ad space, exorbitant fees, or campaigns that bleed money due to misleading KPIs.\n\nIn eCommerce, the ledger will help consumers track the origins of the product they’ve purchased via ads, reducing fraud and the propagation of counterfeit goods. (See also: Google Bans Advertising Related To Cryptocurrency Products.)Forfeiting the Keys to the Kingdom\n\nThere are other companies using blockchain to revolutionize the advertising industry as well. AdChain, for example, seeks to combat inefficiencies in the space differently. By incentivizing advertising campaign audits with its tokens, AdChain enforces the simple idea that advertisers should get what they pay for.\n\nAdditionally, performance and impression data is encrypted so that only those who paid for the data can use it to gain valuable insights. Many more ideas, and the blockchain companies behind them, are threatening the industry’s status quo as well.\n\nWith the Interactive Advertising Bureau throwing its weight behind blockchain, it’s only a matter of time before solutions like Kind Ads or AdChain become the new standard. Their best chance is simply to illustrate to advertisers that the new deal is head and shoulders above the status quo, in every way.\n\nFor businesses, it’s impossible to argue against lower overheads and a higher level of control. This idea is enough for blockchain to gain a foothold, which is all it needs to begin chipping away at the industry’s looming goliaths.

    "title": "Are Smart Contracts the Best of Blockchain?\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Smart contracts may be one of the best innovations to accompany blockchain development.\n\n",
    "content": "Every day presents a fresh opportunity to uncover a new application for blockchain technology. After successfully forming the backbone for a revolutionary cryptocurrency, the blockchain is bringing forth strategic evolutions across industries including logistics, web security, and even trade finance. However, nowhere is this advance more evident than its growing function as an innovative payment solution. One of the key pillars driving this rapid adoption is the embrace of smart contracts.\n\nSimply stated, smart contracts are a form of automated contracts that use pre-defined rules to facilitate the exchange of nearly any good or service. The overarching principle is to increase the transparency of the transaction while reducing fees and allaying the potential for conflict over nonperformance. However, unlike traditional contracts, these contracts have no room for interpretation because all terms are predetermined and automatically enforced by the contract itself. (See also: Understanding Smart Contracts.)A simple analogy for understanding the purpose would be pizza delivery. In this example, a pizzeria promises 30-minute delivery for a pie or money back guaranteed. The pizzeria would then create a smart contract with a customer ordering a pie. The customer could put the funds in escrow, and if the pizza is delivered within 30 minutes, the funds are released from escrow to the pizzeria. If the pizzeria fails to deliver on time, the money held in escrow is returned to the customer. While overgeneralized, this example readily illustrates how smart contracts can be applied across nearly any activity that requires some sort of contract to establish trust and security between parties.\n\nBridging the Ingenuity of Blockchain With Modern Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are simply that – smart. They are very carefully designed to carry out specially designed functions and tasks without the intervention of either of the parties which could result in the breach of said contract. In the event of a breach, the contract is optimized to ensure that the other party is not damaged by the violation.\n\nThe principle of keeping funds in escrow, for instance, is completely solved by smart contracts without the need for an especially complicated legal framework that requires fees or a broker. Each side is protected by the agreement. If the seller fails to deliver on all the terms of the contract, the other party keeps their funds or other deliverable. The reverse is also true if the buyer fails to post the funds in escrow.\n\nAs cryptocurrency gains greater application and adoption, smart contracts effectively enable trade with significantly fewer barriers. Companies are already racing to the space to build straightforward contractual solutions for businesses of all shapes and sizes.\n\nOne example of this focus on smart contracts is Jincor, thanks to its simplification of the system for parties that are not comfortable with blockchain technology or cryptocurrency applications. The system can handle transfers tied to trade agreements or even implement employment contracts. Its integrated wallet solution accompanied by contract templates and an arbitration platform helps Jincor broaden the appeal for companies seeking ways to integrate blockchain with daily business activities.\n\n\"The volume of commodity-money transactions is much larger in the business sector than in the consumer one,\" explained Anton Lysakov from Jincor. \"The evolution of Jincor ecosystem will encourage companies to use cryptocurrencies for corporate needs and, therefore, transfer digital assets turnover into mainstream trend.\"The Automation Effect\n\nUltimately, the embrace of smart contracts may very well owe its success to two of its key pillars: automation and the cost savings it brings. Foremost, transferring funds within a digital environment is much faster than traditional bank transfers, which can be time-consuming and costly. If digital wallets on either side of a transaction can be verified, it creates an atmosphere of trust that enables both parties to collaborate without fear of loss or the need to build confidence. (See also: How to Invest in Bitcoin Futures.)Apart from saving legal expenses by building a template, enforcement becomes a much less costly endeavor, and transaction times can be shortened significantly. The amount of time it takes from contract inception to completion is also reduced, saving money and reducing associated back-office expenditures. Once a transfer is recorded by the receiving party, funds or other assets can be immediately disbursed to the other party. With the smart contract in place, all these activities are automatically executed as a function of its design, reducing the likelihood of fraud and contract failure.\n\nFacilitating Trust Without Worrying About Enforceability\n\nWhen large contracts depend on both sides fulfilling numerous conditions, any number of things could go wrong. This means companies face a degree of risk when transacting with suppliers or clients. To move forward without the risk of a drawn-out legal process should either side fail to honor their obligations, two entities can enter into a smart contract that establishes a set of milestones for payment to be released for any services rendered or received. Apart from being a magnificent risk-management tool, smart contracts can effectively remove trust from the transactability equation.\n\nThanks to the numerous functional benefits of smart contracts, they stand out as one of the best innovations to accompany blockchain development. Apart from helping formerly uninterested parties adopt the blockchain for payments and agreements, the protections offered by smart contracts present a win-win scenario for all participants involved.\n\nWith automation efforts accelerating across the globe, blockchain and digital ledgers will play a pivotal role across industries. To this end, smart contracts are a helpful innovation accompanying many blockchain activities, helping end-users benefit by lowering fees, hastening transaction speeds, ensuring performance, and increasing protections for associated parties entering into an agreement.\n\n",

    "content": "In the massive world of online advertising, blockchain will be a force to reckon with. Unlike with some blockchain products such as cryptocurrency, advertising can employ blockchain in a plethora of unique ways. The applications of this technology in advertising will help ad creatives target audiences better, share data, make users safer and more private, and democratize who controls the data that the industry relies on.\n\nA New Direction for Advertising\n\nOne of the most notable features of blockchain as a finance application is anonymity. While this is a product of blockchain’s origins in bitcoin, for advertising, anonymity is sometimes counter-productive. Blockchain solutions for advertising will instead make use of the robust accountability that the technology provides, wiping the slate clean for all participants.\n\nBlockchains built since the original (bitcoin) have expanded upon the importance of such transparency, and many of the most influential chains will find their killer apps in the advertising world. Companies like Papyrus exemplify this trend, with platforms that make it easy for users to know exactly who is paying to advertise to them, and where their data is coming from. With Papyrus, these users can even decide not to share any of their browsing habits or other usage data, though if they do, advertisers can pay them for it directly.\n\nFrom the user side, this is preferable to the excess of ceaseless, inaccurate ads that bombard us daily. Advertisers might be put off at first, but will quickly realize that the system works in their favor as well.\n\nThis type of schema is a far cry from the current way of doing things, which sees users voluntarily surrender their most personal information with little reward. These are the “terms and conditions” that most people skip over when setting up new applications. With new, blockchain-based platforms like Papyrus and MetaX, all those with a stake in advertising will share resources, see the entire flow of information in the same place, and have an even playing field that allows for more efficient competition.\n\nAnother venture, Bitcomo – a blockchain-driven lead generation platform – is creating a smart contract-based advertising model (pre-sale ICO kicks off on September 18) in which payment is due once results been delivered or after generating a smart contract-triggered sale. Bitcomo offers a solution to the traditional advertising model in which publishers are at the mercy of advertisers who are not always able to pay the entire commission as a protection against leads that were not approved.\n\nSimilarly, advertisers cannot be certain they are getting their money\u0027s worth and are often forced to blacklist publishers who may be conducting fraudulent activities. (See also: Investing in Cryptocurrencies: What to Keep In Mind.)Kanstruktor over at Steemit explains: \"Decentralized network between advertisers and publishers through caching, and logging of clicks and leads, key statistics, personalized nodes in the blockchain operator MetaHash (fork of Ethereum – ERC20). It is a basic principle of protection against fraud and concealment of data on actual transactions from advertisers, or making unrealistic target bots in the traffic of publishers instead of real users.\"Blockchain’s Advertising Chops\n\nFor online advertising, data is precious. It reveals patterns in one’s shopping and search history, comprises social media posts and leaves priceless clues behind. Blockchain distributes this data to the entire network, whereas it was once kept on secure company servers and put up for sale to bidders with a relevant interest.\n\nApart from functionality that gives users more control, and puts the value of their data exclusively in their hands, this decentralized system benefits ad creators as well. They will have access to immense shared pools of relevant data, already vetted by other participants and proven with the chain, making ad targeting much more accurate and much less expensive. Blockchain’s irrefutable, ledger-like system is a perfect tool in the hands of ad companies whose bread and butter are key performance indicators like clicks and likes.\n\nInstead of paying upfront for expensive ad space targeting fishermen, for instance, the same fishing gear company can use a blockchain advertising company to target those who have expressly stated (with their data-sharing preferences) that they are interested in such gear. The game will no longer be based on flighty browsing habits, but on hard data. Moreover, smart contract ad buying solutions make it possible for companies to buy conditional space, which will only show an ad should the target fulfill certain parameters.\n\nBlockchain’s Future in Advertising\n\nOnline advertising companies are just now beginning to develop real use cases for blockchain in their daily activities, and those who get ahead of the curve sooner will benefit greatly. Blockchain is the ultimate democratization tool, and while those who currently protect the status quo are right to be afraid, at some point everyone will realize that an open system creates as many opportunities as it takes away.\n\nThe future is fast in coming, and instead of predicting it, the fast movers are already making it happen.\n\n",

    "title": "How Blockchain Can Fight Piracy\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Piracy could cost the television and movie industries $52 billion by 2022, but blockchain technology could potentially play a role to control that.\n\nDigital piracy costs the U.S. economy an estimated loss of domestic revenues of at least $29.2 billion each year, along with an estimated reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion. Using blockchain technology could be one strategy to help in the effort to halt digital piracy. In theory, a blockchain Internet and distributed ledger technology (DLT) could help prevent pirates from hiding their unlawful piracy activities online. Companies are already using blockchain to prevent piracy through content surveillance and digital watermarking.\n\nThe estimated number of viewings of U.S.-produced movies that are pirated digitally each year.\n\n",
    "content": "In a study produced by the Global Innovation Policy Center for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, global online piracy costs the U.S. economy at least $29.2 billion and as much as $71 billion in lost domestic revenues each year.\n\nWhile this figure is significant, it doesn\u0027t take into account the annual losses to the U.S. economy in jobs and in the reduced gross domestic product (GDP). The report estimates digital video piracy results in between $47.5 billion and $115.3 billion in reduced U.S. GDP per year along with losses of between 230,000 and 560,000 jobs.﻿﻿To be sure, media companies have taken steps to protect their content from piracy, but this has not been enough to fully cut off the process. Now, analysts have speculated that blockchain technology could potentially play a role in the control of this content and the protection against piracy going forward.\n\nBlockchain as a Player in the Fight\n\nWhile blockchain is unlikely to be able to address piracy fully on its own, blockchain technology could be best put toward this cause as one component of a larger effort to stop piracy.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that there are many potential reasons why piracy takes place, and experts have yet to arrive at a definitive explanation for the practice. Various factors like cultural norms, lack of access, unaffordability, and even a general view of media content as not having inherent value can all contribute to piracy activities.\n\nIn theory, if the Internet were built on blockchain technology, it could become impossible or, at the very least, extremely difficult for pirates to unlawfully share and profit from media content. The reason for this, presumably, is that a blockchain Internet would allow for the tracking of unlawful actions via distributed ledger technology (DLT). Individuals would not be able to hide their piracy activities as they can now. However, a blockchain Internet remains speculative.\n\nContent Surveillance\n\nOne way that blockchain can help to prevent piracy at this stage is through content surveillance. Vevue is a blockchain streaming service developing a technology to track the life cycle of media content. Founder Thomas Olson has indicated that \"if someone copies content tracked by our technology by any possible means, including videoing or recording a screen, our platform will be able to identify the owner of the device/system where the content was last played.\"﻿﻿In this case, blockchain itself does not track the content; this is dependent upon a unique computational process inherent in Vevue\u0027s project. However, blockchain would allow the surveillance data to be stored and shared efficiently. Put another way, blockchain is a record that Vevue\u0027s team can use to assist in the tracking actions of its proprietary technology.\n\nBounty Hunting\n\nBlockchain can also help with the process of digital watermarking, a process akin to bounty hunting. South African company CustosTech has used the bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to build a proprietary digital watermarking technology. This technology allows the embedding of a monetary reward, like BTC tokens, in media files. These watermarks are embedded in such a way as to be imperceptible to the content receiver and impossible to remove. If a file is pirated, CustosTech can analyze the watermark for that file to determine who the legal recipient of the file was.\n\nThe fact that a monetary reward can be encoded in the process as well could serve as an incentive for those outside of the media space to help find pirated files. Indeed, CustosTech\u0027s bounty-hunting program is available to anyone. By helping to track down pirated files, hunters can earn rewards in BTC.\n\nThe idea of rewarding users with cryptocurrency for their assistance in fighting piracy translates to the project of Rawg, a cross-device game discovery platform, as well. This company is aiming to create a blockchain system that rewards video gamers with cryptocurrency tokens for achievements they earn in the game itself. Gamers are only able to synchronize their achievements for token rewards with non-pirated games and on official platforms. In this sense, Rawg is not offering a bounty-hunting reward but rather an incentive for gamers to avoid piracy on their own.\n\nMany other projects are exploring the anti-piracy space and using blockchain technology. Are they likely to fully eradicate the practice? No, but they very well may help to reduce the amount of revenue lost as a result.\n\n",

    "content": "Blockchain is emerging as a powerful technological force that promises to change the travel industry’s status quo. In fact, it\u0027s already being heralded as a game-changer for many different industries. Remember that blockchain is a type of database that is commonly used in the cryptocurrency market wherein data is stored in blocks and then chained together.\n\nServices that are based on blockchain are already isolating major pain points in a very fragmented industry—travel and tourism. It should come as no surprise that this sector is broken up into different parts. Think flights, hotels, car rentals, among other factors. So how can blockchain help? These services are able to ease hurdles in the industry by resolving common challenges and streamlining processes while building a more equitable ecosystem that shuns gatekeepers.\n\nThe technology’s impact is more than hypothetical, though, with several businesses disrupting several nodes on the industry’s supply chain. The following five companies are improving key aspects of the travel ecosystem and establishing blockchain’s place in the industry.\n\n1. Winding Tree: Displacing Online Booking Hubs\n\nMajor travel service aggregators like Expedia and Priceline dominate airfare bookings. But this comes at a serious cost to both travelers and airlines. Booking through these websites often includes hefty fees and surcharges made possible by their largely unchallenged status as gatekeepers. Blockchain-based startup Winding Tree works to unseat these entrenched giants by challenging their role as industry middlemen.\n\nWinding Tree is a private company based in Switzerland. Founded in 2017, it reaches numerous parts of the travel and tourism industry, including hotels and airfare. The company uses \"blockchain technology to enable a fair and competitive travel distribution market.\"The company seeks to connect travelers directly with service providers like airlines, hotels, and tour guides with its LÍF token. The aim is to minimize fees for travelers while reducing costs for service providers. LÍF is Winding Tree\u0027s platform cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company’s clever use of smart contracts and the ERC827 protocol delivers better savings for every stakeholder in the travel and tourism industry. Winding Tree\u0027s nonprofit status assures there are no middlemen adding unnecessary fees to the booking process.\n\n2. Webjet: Adding Assurances and Avoiding Inaccuracies\n\nInaccurate or lost hotel bookings add considerable stress and anxiety to a travel experience. When this happens, customers usually have to take on fees across several layers of the supply chain while providers consistently extract value.\n\nThanks to blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger technology, Webjet has built a new model designed to avoid these irritating booking experiences. The company is a prominent online travel agency based in Australia and was founded in 1998. Webjet claims that it is Australia and New Zealand\u0027s leading online agency and is a leader in online tools and technology.\n\nWebjet officially launched its blockchain platform in 2019. The system enhances the customer experience by recording all entries on the blockchain’s immutable ledger, which reduces the likelihood of mistaken or lost bookings and reduces the layers between sellers and consumers. It does this by locating real-time data problems that may occur between customers, agents, and hotels and sending messages to every party.\n\nThe technology’s improved security features provide better protection for the ecosystem. Apart from building greater supply chain efficiencies and reducing costs for hotels, travelers ultimately benefit from lower-cost bookings along with more transparency and greater accountability.\n\n3. Sandblock: Improving Loyalty’s Fungibility\n\nLoyalty rewards have gone through several iterations in the competitive travel and tourism industry. Many frequent travelers belong to airline and hotel loyalty programs. Spending points and miles often means jumping through multiple hoops to redeem rewards. Despite high participation rates in loyalty programs, many customers report a willingness to accept better deals from competing carriers and service providers if the price is right.\n\nSandblock is one of the newest entrants to this part of the industry. Founded in 2017, Sandblock is based in France. It aims to change the loyalty landscape with its blockchain-based platform by allowing travel providers to create their own loyalty tokens, which can be exchanged for brand-specific rewards. Not only that but they can also be used like real coins and exchanged for fiat money.\n\nUsers can also apply their tokens to redeem rewards across a variety of services beyond the company that awarded them and can earn more by being active participants in the community. For businesses, the reward is better data and transparency, and an ecosystem that actually returns value thanks to improved targeting and happier consumers.\n\n4. Accenture: Striving Towards Shorter Lines\n\nSpending hours waiting in lines at airports is one of the major annoyances of traveling the globe not just for travelers but also for airlines and airport staff. Congestion can add to the time spent in lines for security, customs, and passport control. Security needs are also trumpeted as the reason for tighter controls and oversight, all of which contribute to frequent travelers\u0027 headaches.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and expedite the security process, Accenture (ACN) developed the Known Traveler Digital Identity System. The consulting firm partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to help disrupt the global travel industry.\n\nThis blockchain is designed to collect and host identifying information from frequent international travelers, enabling a freer flow of data between travelers and customs agents to ease the clearance process.\n\nThis allows travelers to gain control over their digital identities with better security thanks to distributed ledger technology. Airports and airlines benefit from accelerated processing and better security, helping shorten lines all while alleviating one of the biggest traveler pain points.\n\n5. TravelChain: Making the Most of Data\n\nData is a prized commodity in today’s economy. It offers businesses insights and advantages when used appropriately. Data generated by travelers, which is highly valuable to service providers, is generally restricted to gatekeepers such as Expedia and Orbitz. These companies offer a faster booking process at a price. This raises costs and adds to the informational asymmetry for service providers.\n\nTravelChain is a new entrant that wants to upend the paradigm with an open-source blockchain. The Russian company seeks to remove intermediaries on the supply chain. Users are empowered to collect and monetize their travel data, keeping it safe from prying eyes and receiving tokens as compensation for sharing with travel service providers. These tokens can then be redeemed for services or money.\n\nParticipating companies can access more granular information about travelers, channeling these insights for more pinpointed promotion targeting. Apart from personalizing marketing, these companies can offer customized tours and promotions based on a traveler’s preferences, closing the entire ecosystem loop and delivering value to all stakeholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTraveling should be comfortable, cost-effective, and most importantly, enjoyable. While fees, booking irregularities, bad reviews, and long lines may be symptomatic of the current travel environment, blockchain is challenging this status quo with a host of new services designed to modernize and streamline the travel experience.\n\nThanks to the formation of more equitable ecosystems constructed to reduce the presence of intermediaries, travelers and service providers can build more mutually fulfilling relationships that contribute to better overall value.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "summary": "Read about the Bitcoin blockchain, a public ledger shared among all Bitcoin users that records information about every single Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is essentially an enormous, shared, encrypted list of all addresses that hold Bitcoin balances. Blockchains consist of a series of individual blocks, arranged in chronological order based on the order of transactions.

    "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain is essentially an enormous, shared, encrypted list of all addresses that hold Bitcoin balances. Because this list is shared, it is referred to as a digital distributed ledger technology (DLT). Every new block represents the latest update to account balances. A block simply refers to a set of Bitcoin transactions that are related because they took place within the same time period. New blocks are created after further mining takes place or a transaction occurs where Bitcoin is exchanged.\n\nBlocks are stacked on top of each other in such a way that one block depends on the previous. In this manner, a chain of blocks is created; this is where the term \"blockchain\" comes from. When a transaction is submitted to the Bitcoin network, the information is passed on through all Bitcoin nodes—all computers connected to other computers in the blockchain—at the same time (through the blockchain).\n\nThe Function of a Blockchain\n\nIn this way, it functions much like a public ledger, accounting for economic transactions and providing a way to verify that all Bitcoin users have been equipped with the same information. Everyone can download a copy of the blockchain and use it to trace the path of Bitcoins from one Bitcoin transaction to another. (It should be noted that although there is a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made, they are linked to a specific Bitcoin address, rather than a personally-identifying name or email. For this reason, Bitcoin is considered pseudonymous.)The goal of a blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed to every participant, but never edited. This permanence is called immutability, which is a crucial feature of the blockchain data architecture. While a blockchain can be used to store any number of data points (votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, etc.), Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments.\n\nIn a blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. For Bitcoin, this data includes the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions. If one node has an error in its data, it can use the thousands of other nodes as a reference point to correct itself.\n\nInformation Contained in Each Block\n\nBlockchains consist of a series of individual blocks, arranged in chronological order based on the order of transactions. There are two parts to the information contained in a block.\n\nThe first part consists of the header elements: information about the location and other data related to the transactions contained within that block. For example, a hash within the header points to the previous block. There are no hashes for genesis blocks because these blocks have no predecessor. A merkle tree—a data structure used in computer science to record transactions—is used to display the sequence of transactions contained within the block. Another hash within the block contains timestamp information, the nonce, and the difficulty level. Here is a brief explanation of each of these components:The second part is the identifier information. Again, this is a cryptographic hash function. It is generated by hashing the header elements twice in a row.\n\nBlockchain More Anonymous Than a Bank Statement\n\nOne of the alleged benefits (or risks, depending on your outlook) of Bitcoin is its unique anonymity. Those transacting in Bitcoins are supposed to be tied to a specific Bitcoin address, rather than a personally-identifying name or email. Yet anonymity is somewhat compromised because of the blockchain information ledger.﻿﻿Since every transaction is publicly logged, one single breach of ownership identity could lead to the revelation of many other owners by simply following back the transactions. The blockchain is still more anonymous than a bank statement, but it is not an impenetrable veil of secrecy, as some proponents of Bitcoin technology like to assert.\n\n",

    "title": "How Blockchain Will Revolutionize Future Cars\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain has been flexing its muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense untapped potential.\n\nIn order for autonomous cars to enter the mainstream, they must continue to improve their ability to collect and communicate data from their surrounding environment. To maintain safety, driverless cars must constantly be aware of conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Using blockchain\u0027s decentralized ledger, driverless cars could have access to key traffic data almost simultaneously and more accurately. Enabled by blockchain technology, smart contracts could simplify many aspects of driving, such as paying for car insurance, repairs, and tolls.\n\nIn its 2021 annual automated vehicle survey, the American Automobile Association (AAA) found that only 14% of drivers would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself.\n\n",
    "content": "The future’s cars have long since moved from our imagination into the real world. High-profile successes and failures have created a polarized discussion surrounding the industry’s outlook, but no conclusions have emerged.\n\nAs more automakers contemplate the direction of the industry, there are still too many unanswered questions. For one, companies continue to focus exclusively on their cars, and not on the ecosystem they drive in. Even so, the emergence of blockchain as a viable way to store and communicate data seamlessly is a promising addition to the equation.\n\nThe key ingredient in successful autonomous vehicle deployment is creating environments that foster two-way communication between cars and their supporting infrastructure. While the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities have taken this in a positive direction, blockchain technology delivers a significant upgrade that could revolutionize the future of driving.\n\nConnecting Cars and Cities\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to autonomous cars entering the mainstream is the fact that they are still not connected enough to their surrounding environment. While cars can perceive millions of data points per second, they must view them in isolation and without context.\n\nUsing IoT devices improves this functionality significantly as they can collect and communicate crucial contextual data to cars to improve their performance. This includes information about road conditions, traffic accidents, and other cars on the road that could affect a vehicle’s ability to drive.\n\nEven so, IoT devices remain bound by the limitations current technology imposes on them. Centralization makes data vulnerable, and the inability to communicate data rapidly between points reduces its usefulness in real-time situations. However, blockchain technology can significantly enhance the status quo.\n\nSAE International’s Levels of Driving Automation for On-Road VehiclesSource: SAE InternationalBlockchain Advantages\n\nAn advantageous benefit blockchain brings to the table is the ability to spread data more efficiently and rapidly. Driverless cars must constantly be aware of a few key factors: the conditions on the road, their own condition, and the status of other cars. Traditional IoT makes this process complex because of its communication protocols.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralized ledger means that each node in the network—in this case each car and data point—has access to all data almost simultaneously, and more accurately. Companies are already working on integrating better vehicle tracking and communication to improve overall connectivity. Creating decentralized networks that more seamlessly transfer data to all points is the first step toward building a safe driverless ecosystem.\n\nPutting Microservices on the Blockchain\n\nAnother increasingly popular use case for blockchain technology in driverless cars is improving transactions that occur repeatedly between vehicles as well as vehicles and the infrastructure around them. It may not seem significant, but it could reduce friction at several points, advance communication, and reduce traffic bottlenecks.\n\nAn important area where this will likely be employed relates to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) microtransactions. In this model, car owners could use tokens—such as Streamr’s DATA token—to pay for data they require from other cars. This could include weather forecasts, gas prices nearby, congestion data, and more. Vehicles could then earn tokens simply by sharing their data or choosing to sell it to advertisers or manufacturers. With this strategy, blockchain creates a V2V closed ecosystem that incentivizes and rewards participation simultaneously.\n\nIn terms of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), blockchain offers cars a significantly streamlined payment ecosystem that is designed to simplify many aspects of driving. Instead of having to manually pay for multiple things—car maintenance, tolls, insurance, and more—blockchain could enable automated payments thanks to smart contracts.\n\nA shining example of an attribute smart contracts could improve is usage-based insurance (UBI). Instead of paying yearly insurance premiums that can vary thanks to murky factors, drivers could automate their insurance to be paid based on usage.\n\nThese UBI systems require significant data input to ensure accurate quotes and premiums for drivers. However, by tapping into public blockchains, insurers could instantly calculate a driver’s premium and simply execute pre-existing smart contracts to automate payments.\n\nOne other interesting application of blockchain-based microservices for vehicles relates to ride-sharing. The sector is currently controlled by ride-hailing applications like Uber and Lyft, but there is increasing competition emerging from popular ride-sharing services like Google’s Waze, which instead emphasizes carpooling over taxis.\n\nThe Toyota Research Institute (TRI) has already made some headway in terms of studying and planning for integrating the automotive sector with blockchain. TRI works with several startups to create systems that improve ride-sharing via blockchain, possibly even including car sharing for seats and empty trunk space. In April 2021, Toyota bought \"Level 5,\" the self-driving research department of Lyft.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain has been flexing its disruptive muscles in several industries, but the automotive sector offers immense potential. By changing smaller aspects of the driving experience and improving the security of drivers on the road, the technology could prove a revolutionary catalyst for a more autonomous experience. As more automakers and infrastructure businesses discover new ways to integrate blockchain, consumers will soon bear witness to the transportation transformation spurred by distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A hard fork is a radical change to the protocol of a blockchain network that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid—or vice-versa.\n\nA hard fork refers to a radical change to the protocol of a blockchain network that effectively results in two branches, one that follows the previous protocol and one that follows the new version. In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying. A hard fork can occur in any blockchain, and not only Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others, for example).\n\nAs the graphic below displays, nodes that are not upgraded reject the new rules, which creates a divergence, or hard fork, in the blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Hard Fork?\n\nA hard fork (or hardfork), as it relates to blockchain technology, is a radical change to a network\u0027s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice-versa. A hard fork requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.\n\nForks may be initiated by developers or members of a crypto community who grow dissatisfied with functionalities offered by existing blockchain implementations. They may also emerge as a way to crowdsource funding for new technology projects or cryptocurrency offerings.\n\nA hard fork can be contrasted with a soft fork.\n\nUnderstanding a Hard Fork\n\nA hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain no longer accept the older version(s) of the blockchain; which creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.\n\nAdding a new rule to the code essentially creates a fork in the blockchain: one path follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other path continues along the old path. Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.\n\nHow Forks Work\n\nA fork in a blockchain can occur in any crypto-technology platform—not only Bitcoin. That is because blockchains and cryptocurrency work in basically the same way no matter which crypto platform they\u0027re on. You may think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Because the miners in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these miners understand the new rules.\n\nHowever, all of the miners need to agree about the new rules and about what comprises a valid block in the chain. So when you want to change those rules you need to \"fork it\"—like a fork in a road—to indicate that there\u0027s been a change in or a diversion to the protocol. The developers can then update all of the software to reflect the new rules.\n\nIt is through this forking process that various digital currencies with names similar to bitcoin have come to be: bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. For the casual cryptocurrency investor, it can be difficult to tell the difference between these cryptocurrencies and to map the various forks onto a timeline. To help sort this out, we have composed a history of the most important bitcoin hard forks of the past several years. Additionally, those looking to get involved with one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges need to tread carefully when investing in currencies like Bitcoin so as not to waste time and money on the wrong digital currency.\n\nReasons For a Hard Fork?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why developers may implement a hard fork, such as correcting important security risks found in older versions of the software, to add new functionality, or to reverse transactions—such as when the Ethereum blockchain created a hard fork to reverse the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\n\nAfter the hack, the Ethereum community almost unanimously voted in favor of a hard fork to roll back transactions that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their ether (ETH) funds returned.\n\nThe proposal for a hard fork did not exactly unwind the network’s transaction history. Rather, it relocated the funds tied to the DAO to a newly created smart contract with the single purpose of letting the original owners withdraw their funds.\n\nDAO token holders could withdraw ETH at a rate of approximately 1 ETH to 100 DAO. The extra balance of tokens and any ether that remained as a result of the hard fork was withdrawn and distributed by the DAO curators to provide \"failsafe protection\" for the organization.\n\nHard Forks vs. Soft Forks\n\nHard forks and soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform\u0027s existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.\n\nWith a soft fork, only one blockchain will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains, and a soft fork is meant to result in one.\n\nConsidering the differences in security between hard and soft forks, almost all users and developers call for a hard fork, even when a soft fork seems like it could do the job. Overhauling the blocks in a blockchain requires a tremendous amount of computing power, but the privacy gained from a hard fork makes more sense than using a soft fork.\n\n",

    "title": "Blockchain Technology Could Revolutionize Traditional Banking\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry.\n\n",
    "content": "One of the biggest threats to the banking sector today is technology. Whether it is coming from large technology firms such as Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL), eBay Inc. (EBAY) or Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), or from new financial technology (FinTech) start-ups, traditional banks are beginning to take notice, and some of them are now taking part as well.\n\nOne potential disrupter for the financial industry today comes from applications involving blockchain technology—the tamper-proof system of distributed ledgers that underlie cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Large financial institutions, from investment banks to stock exchanges to central banks, are all beginning to work on their own blockchain-based solutions in order to stay on top of this innovation.\n\nBanks Are Taking Notice\n\nBefore looking at just how blockchain technology can disrupt traditional banking, it is worth taking note of some of the key institutions that have publicly announced interest in it (meanwhile, many other banks are doing so without informing the public).\n\nPayments and Remittances\n\nThe most obvious and basic use for blockchain technology is its use as a payments system. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies act both as digital money and a method to send payments in that money form around the globe. These transactions require only an internet connection and take place instantly. While it is true that it may take many minutes for a transaction to be 100% confirmed, the transaction itself takes place in a matter of moments. These transactions are borderless, secure, and largely anonymous. Furthermore, transaction costs are minimal, costing only a few cents per transaction making it a much cheaper way to send money around the world than wire companies like Western Union (WU) and Wise or via credit card processors such as Visa Inc. (V), Mastercard Inc. (MA), or Discover Financial Services (DFS). A merchant not wanting to pay the initial and ongoing fees in order to accept credit cards could take electronic payment via a cryptocurrency instead for a fraction of the cost.\n\nRemittance overseas is a difficult undertaking. The fees are high, the processing time is slow, the money can be intercepted or stolen, and there are legal and tax issues that must be considered. A blockchain-based system would eliminate these problems. There are already dozens of companies that have been started to facilitate remittances in this way.\n\nAccount Balances and Deposits\n\nConsumers generally utilize banks to hold deposits in checking and savings accounts. But once you deposit money into a bank account, the bank loans most of it out via fractional reserve banking. As a result, most of the money that shows up when you view your account balance is not held by the bank. In fact, a bank run causes a bank to fail when too many customers attempt to withdraw their money all at the same time, and the money just isn\u0027t there. A bank account balance, therefore, is just an accounting entry.\n\nThe blockchain is ultimately a ledger that represents accounting entries. Therefore, bank accounts could come to be represented on blockchains making them more secure, accessible, and cheaper to maintain. Furthermore, it could help alleviate the risk of bank runs.\n\nSecondary Market Trading and Clearing\n\nThe simplest purchase of a company\u0027s shares to a complex over-the-counter currency swap requires clearing and settlement of trades. Ownership of the asset or contract being traded must verifiably change hands and be recorded. Today, exchange fees and clearing fees are added to the cost of each trade and can become sizable over time and given large volumes of orders.\n\nIf the ownership of shares could exist on a blockchain and any change of ownership could be immediately validated and confirmed, it would greatly reduce transaction costs and clearing costs for all sorts of asset classes from stocks to bonds to derivatives to commodities to real estate. It is entirely possible that such storied institutions as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade may one day be replaced by a distributed ledger technology that is more secure, robust, and less expensive to operate and transact on.\n\nOverstock (OSTK) recently announced it was developing a blockchain-based asset exchange called T0 in order to directly issue some of its corporate bonds to investors. New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has announced that it will roll out a blockchain-based platform to clear over-the-counter transactions which allows settling in T+10 minutes. To put that into perspective, buying a share of stock on a U.S. exchange takes T+2 days to settle.\n\nPrimary Market Issuance and IPOs\n\nIf secondary market trading can occur on blockchains, can primary markets also exist? The answer is yes. Imagine you are a company seeking to raise capital via issuing new shares to the public via an IPO. Today, this would be a very expensive undertaking requiring an investment bank (or a syndicate of such banks) to underwrite and sell your shares. This can cost up to 7% of a company\u0027s gross proceeds.\n\nNow, imagine being able to issue shares of your company by yourself directly to the blockchain where you can then sell them in exchange for money. These virtual shares can then be exchanged on secondary markets that also exist via the blockchain. If this scenario becomes accepted by the public, it could be a huge disrupter to both asset exchanges as well as the investment banking industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain technology is being taken seriously by the financial sector as it may prove to be a great disrupter to the traditional banking industry. The tamper-proof, decentralized, immutable nature of the blockchain makes it ideal for reducing costs and streamlining everything from payments, asset trading, securities issuance, retail banking, and clearing and settlements. It becomes obvious that blockchain technology is much more than Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. While those implementations as payments and money systems are indeed disruptive, the greater disruption may come from alternative uses of these unique and powerful characteristics.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Much like the internet, it iss possible to divide the development of blockchain into stages.\n\n",
    "content": "In the development of the internet, one can point to landmark events that can be used to divide the process into stages. Among these important landmarks are the creation of the first wide-area computer networks in the 1960s, the development of an electronic mail system in the 1970s, the creation of ethernet later in that decade, the launching of the world wide web in the 1990s and the creation of the first browsers and search engines later in that decade, among others. Following each of these hallmark developments, the internet changed in a dramatic way. Each step was pivotal in creating the internet that we know and rely on today.\n\nIn a similar way, it\u0027s possible to look back on the development of blockchain and also divide it into stages which are marked off by important developments and inventions. Blockchain technology has only been in existence for a fraction of the time that the internet has, so it\u0027s likely that there are still important developments to come. Even now, though, experts have begun to divide the history of blockchain into at least three important stages.\n\nStage 1: Bitcoin and Digital Currencies\n\nWhile the ideas that would go into the blockchain were swirling around in computer science communities, it was the pseudonymous developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who outlined the blockchain as we know it in the white paper for BTC. In this way, blockchain technology began with the Bitcoin network. While blockchain has since gone on to see use in a huge variety of other areas, in some sense it was designed specially for this digital currency and for advancing the goals of digital currencies more broadly.\n\nIn the earliest stages, blockchain set up the basic premise of a shared public ledger that supports a cryptocurrency network. Satoshi\u0027s idea of blockchain makes use of 1 megabyte (MB) blocks of information on bitcoin transactions. Blocks are linked together through a complex cryptographic verification process, forming an immutable chain. Even in its earliest guises, blockchain technology set up many of the central features of these systems, which remain today. Indeed, bitcoin\u0027s blockchain remains largely unchanged from these earliest efforts.\n\nStage 2: Smart Contracts\n\nAs time went on, developers began to believe that a blockchain could do more than simply document transactions. Founders of ethereum, for instance, had the idea that assets and trust agreements could also benefit from blockchain management. In this way, ethereum represents the second-generation of the blockchain technology.\n\nThe major innovation brought about by ethereum was the advent of smart contracts. Typically, contracts in the mainstream business world are managed between two separate entities, sometimes with other entities assisting in the oversight process. Smart contracts are those that are self-managing on a blockchain. They are triggered by an event like the passing of an expiration date or the achievement of a particular price goal; in response, the smart contract manages itself, making adjustments as needed and without the input of outside entities.\n\nAt this point, we may still be in the process of harnessing the untapped potential of smart contracts. Thus, whether we have truly moved on to the subsequent stage of the development of blockchain is debatable.\n\nStage 3: The Future\n\nOne of the major issues facing blockchain is scaling. Bitcoin remains troubled by transaction processing times and bottlenecking. Many new digital currencies have attempted to revise their blockchains in order to accommodate these issues, but with varying degrees of success. In the future, one of the most important developments paving the way for blockchain technology going forward will likely have to do with scalability.\n\nBeyond this, new applications of blockchain technology are being discovered and implemented all the time. It\u0027s difficult to say exactly where these developments will lead the technology and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Supporters of blockchain are likely to find this incredibly exciting; from their perspective, we are living in a moment with an epochal technology that is continuing to grow and unfold.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "IOTA\u0027s blockless ledger Tangle wants to position itself as a viable alternative to Ethereum\u0027s blockchain.\n\n",
    "content": "The blockchain craze continues unabated as more companies create new applications faster than ever. The architecture made popular by bitcoin and its contemporaries has proven to be a useful tool that offers better security and transparency, leading to its growing adoption in several industries thanks to its effective communications and public ledger.\n\nEven so, blockchain’s meteoric rise has not been without speed bumps, and there have been instances where it has shown weaknesses that could prove to be major challenges down the road.\n\nIn an industry such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain’s capabilities have proven to be a particularly strong fit. Interconnected devices require rapid and transparent verification of data, something blockchain’s ledger can handle exceptionally well. However, some have complained that blockchain’s somewhat rigid architecture makes it well-suited for robustly storing small amounts of data. This means it’s not truly scalable for things such as big data storage that has come to be synonymous with IoT.\n\nThis and other concerns led a team of developers to launch IOTA, a cryptocurrency platform designed for the demanding IoT ecosystem. With a twist on the traditional blockchain the company calls Tangle, IOTA claims to provide zero-fee transactions, as well as a unique verification process that resolves many of the scalability problems associated with bitcoin.\n\nTangle is attempting to position itself as a viable alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, which is still the gold standard for most applications built on the architecture. Regardless, new Ethereum-based solutions for IoT could render the discussion moot, offering a better way for IoT to function.\n\nStorage Versus Streaming\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention between supporters of blockchain and Tangle is the former’s capacity for data storage. IoT systems create massive amounts of data to parse and store, and most existing blockchains simply cannot handle the load. Indeed, the technology is meant to offer strong, secure storage for limited amounts of data.\n\nDetractors argue that this philosophy is incompatible with IoT design, and proffer that Tangle delivers a better solution thanks to its take on mining. With IOTA, every transaction requires the user to verify two other, random transactions, creating a tangled ledger that reduces the need for mining and theoretically removes any fees. This makes it a useful infrastructure for IoT devices that require micro and nano-transactions to process data being communicated, without raising overheads.\n\nIn this sense, Tangle architecture does exhibit notable advantages over blockchain. Transaction processing in blockchain means that much larger block sizes and volumes will take significantly longer to process as they must be completely verified to be appended to the chain.\n\nFor an IoT platform, this could represent prohibitive costs, and a lack of functionality due to longer processing times. However, some blockchain-based applications could present a third option using Ethereum’s blockchain, helping to resolve many of the system’s issues with data storage.\n\nStreamr, an application based on Ethereum, has designed a platform for IoT systems that uses live data streaming instead of storage. In the development team’s mind, storage in such technology is superfluous on an atomic level, as most devices require live data to make the best possible decisions, as opposed to outdated information.\n\nMoreover, Streamr proposes to create a marketplace that allows IoT providers to monetize their live data and create a greater incentive for interconnectedness and participation. The system even hosts a development environment designed to facilitate easy creation of IoT applications.\n\nEthereum and Tangle: Which Reigns Supreme?\n\nOn a deeper level, this IoT battle between Streamr and IOTA represents a broader clash of philosophies. On one hand, blockchain has proven to be a game-changing technology. Ethereum’s smart contracts and architecture have lead to a boom in the sector, and the democratization of information.\n\nOn the other hand, Tangle offers to virtually remove the cost of transacting and solve the mining issue thanks to its verification methodology. IOTA also claims that its verification method removes many of the centralization problems traditional mining creates. Because there is no need for miners to process blocks of transactions, there is no motivation to centralize the verification process.\n\nHowever, Ethereum backers have countered that even with Tangle’s supposedly superior design, they must still run on hardware that is not optimized for that type of process. Instead, verification could become bogged down due to existing technology’s binary nature, and lead to longer processing times down the line.\n\nMoreover, solutions like Streamr render the data conversation moot, as they remove the burden of data storage from the blockchain. Instead of handling massive amounts of data that can crash the network, live streamed data offers an immediate solution for IoT, and reduces the overall chain’s operational load. Most importantly, however, is that the existing ecosystem is already geared toward existing platforms such as Ethereum’s ERC-20. By creating applications that fit in to the wider environment, developers can reduce the development costs and compatibility issues.\n\nAn Escalating Race\n\nDespite blockchain’s popularity, new solutions are constantly emerging that could threaten its recent darling status in the technology world. While Ethereum has in many ways solidified its staying power and remains the most popular development environment for blockchain-based applications, Tangle is an intriguing competitor.\n\nIOTA’s architecture is still young, and while it has made promising steps towards broader adoption, the newer upstart must still contend with Ethereum’s existing infrastructure and first-mover advantage. Additionally, companies that build on Ethereum remain ahead, as they are already compatible with the prevailing systems. With the introduction of live-data streaming capabilities from companies like Streamr, Tangle may face an uphill battle dethroning Ethereum in the IoT sphere, even when considering its custom-built design.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blocks are files that permanently record cryptocurrency transaction data; once written, they cannot be altered or removed.\n\nA block is a file where information is stored and encrypted. Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information. Blocks and the information within them must be verified by a network before new blocks can be created. Blocks and blockchains are not used solely by cryptocurrencies. They also have many other uses.\n\nSolving for the hash under the proof-of-work protocol is what takes so much energy and computational power. Proof-of-work blockchains adjust mining difficulty based on how fast the network can hash. The Bitcoin network has so much hashing power, and the difficulty is so high it hashes at about 600 exahashes (quintillion, or 18 zeros) per second, and takes about 10 minutes to solve the Bitcoin hashing puzzle.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Block (Blockchain Block)?\n\nBlocks are files stored by a blockchain, where transaction data are permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is closed. Then, a new block is created for new transactions to be entered into and validated.\n\nA block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed without changing all preceding or following blocks.\n\nHow a Block (Blockchain Block) Works\n\nA blockchain network witnesses a great deal of transaction activity. The transactions made during a period are recorded into a file called a block, which is the basis of the blockchain network.\n\nA block stores information. There are many pieces of information included within a block, but it doesn\u0027t occupy a large amount of storage space. Blocks generally include these elements, but it might vary between different types. For example, Bitcoin block structures include:The transaction element is the largest because it contains the most information. It is followed in storage size by the block header, which includes these sub-elements:One 32-bit (four bytes) number in the header is called a nonce (number used once). The nonce is increased with every guess by a value of one. In Bitcoin\u0027s case, the nonce can only go up to a value of about 4 billion before it rolls over to zero again (which takes less than one second). Once this happens, another value called the extra nonce is changed, and the nonce starts over again at zero.\n\nOnce the right combination of block data, nonce, and extra nonce are found, the miner wins the competition. The network closes that block, generates a new one with a header, and the process repeats.\n\nDifferent mechanisms are used to reach a consensus; the most popular for cryptocurrency is proof-of-work (PoW), with proof-of-stake (PoS) becoming more so because of the reduced energy consumption compared to PoW.\n\nThe XRP Ledger uses a mechanism similar to proof-of-history (PoH), where a deterministic transactional ordering algorithm prevents double-spending.\n\nMining\u0027s Relationship to Blocks\n\nMining is the term used for solving the cryptographic puzzle, which acts as the first verification for transactions and proof that work was done to do the verification.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is commonly thought to be solving a complex mathematical problem; mining is actually sending block data through a hashing algorithm (which uses complicated math functions) to generate a hexadecimal number.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin uses the hashing algorithm SHA-256. For a miner to generate the \"winning\" number, the mining program sends the block header, nonce, and the extra nonce through SHA-256. The two nonces are adjusted incrementally until a certain value is reached. This value is another hexadecimal number that requires the network to spend about 10 minutes generating hashes.\n\nOther Block and Blockchain Uses\n\nBecause most blockchain definitions refer to Bitcoin because it was the first cryptocurrency to use one, many people associate blocks and blockchains with Bitcoin. However, other cryptocurrencies use blocks and blockchains as well. It\u0027s important to note that Ethereum\u0027s network also uses blocks and blockchain.\n\nHowever, Ethereum and its blockchain were designed for multiple uses that extend to much more than cryptocurrency. For example, non-fungible tokens, smart contracts, decentralized finance applications, and more have been developed using Ethereum.\n\nBlock and Blockchain Developments\n\nCryptocurrency introduced blockchains to the mainstream, but these distributed ledgers have been under development for many years. Blocks are files that store information, so much more can be done with them than issuing a token that can be used as payment or to invest in.\n\nBlocks and blockchains create unchangeable records. Public blockchains can be widely distributed and nearly impossible to alter, while private blockchains can be secured using accounts and permissions. Permissioned public blockchains are a combination of public and private blockchains. These three types set the stage for what some believe to be the next iteration of the way information and content are stored, accessed, controlled, and secured.\n\nThe backbone of the modern world is connectivity and the internet. Information and content are hosted and stored on centralized servers controlled by businesses and governments. This allows them to censor what you are exposed to, monetize (or demonetize) any content you create, track your spending and viewing habits, set restrictions on what you can and can\u0027t do, and much more.\n\nBlockchain developers are developing systems designed to replace the structure of the web. This emerging structure is commonly called Web 3. Web 3 is a concept that combines tokens, wallets, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains to overhaul the web\u0027s infrastructure and transition ownership of digital content and assets back to creators.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Individuals\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of blockchains on individuals is access to financial services. Even in developed countries, some people do not have access to personal or business loans, credit, or other financial instruments that could help them achieve financial independence and stability.\n\nAnother important expectation for blockchain and Web 3 development is that they will allow you to control how your personal information is used. Information such as your age, income, what you watch, and what you\u0027re shopping for is valuable to businesses. Businesses pay other companies for your information so that they can market specifically to you and others who share your interests.\n\nIf you controlled your information using tokens, you could sell it to a business and make money from it rather than someone else using your information to earn revenue. Even better, imagine placing only the information you want businesses to have in a smart contract. If an entity wanted it, they would have to pay you for it using cryptocurrency. The blockchain would release it, you\u0027d be paid, and the smart contract could keep the business from reselling it to another company without your permission.\n\nBlockchain Impacts for Businesses\n\nBusinesses in all sectors are exploring ways to use blockchains. Insurance companies can use it to facilitate insurance claims and fraud investigations, and the legal industry can use it to reduce time and costs.\n\nIntellectual property rights have always been an issue, with thefts, piracy, and fraud costing billions of dollars. Creators, media, and entertainment providers can tokenize and track content to protect their interests.\n\nFinancial service providers can have access to more individuals. Businesses can use blockchain to accurately and automatically record data, trusting that it cannot be altered by anyone. Data in these cases would be more transparent and actionable, allowing businesses to make more informed and strategic decisions.\n\nMany international businesses use blockchain solutions to make faster and cheaper cross-border payments.

    "content": "Blockchain continues to find new kinds of usage and adoptions with each passing day. While secure storage of any format of data has been tried and tested time and again on blockchain technology, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Justice is possibly the first government authority to pilot a blockchain-based project in a bid to secure digital evidences. (See also: Blockchain App Helps Indigent Defendants Make Bail.)DLT to Handle \u0026 Store Evidence\n\nThe initiative was announced in a blogpost by the Her Majesty’s Courts \u0026 Tribunals Service (HMCTS) portal by Balaji Anbil, the head of digital architecture and cybersecurity at the UK\u0027s Ministry of Justice. The pilot project aims to assess whether the distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be utilized to simplify and streamline the present-day court processes with focus on securely handling digital evidence. The working group constituted to lead the project has already conducted the inaugural meeting and is actively working with industry experts.\n\nDescribing the DLT-based initiative as a part of the larger court reforms program, Anbil states that the project envisages “the application of novel solutions to traditional challenges including evidence sharing, identity management and ensuring citizens have maximum control over their own information. Our service designs are focused on value, simplicity and use of the best modern technology approaches. This brings numerous benefits including cost effective and timely delivery and future proof solutions.”Order in the Court\n\nCiting the practical issues and challenges faced in managing evidence, the working group is looking for a system that is capable of maintaining the records of all system activities that capture how various forms of digital evidences get created, accessed or modified, by which entity or participant and from which location. The records need to be maintained in a chronological order in a way that can easily enable the reconstruction and verification of the sequence of events and actions, which can lead to and certify the current state of the digital evidence. A suitable DLT technology with its intrinsic feature of maintaining a well defined audit trail fits the bill. It can be the crucial platform that can guarantee the integrity of evidence in its secure handling, storage and retrieval.\n\nThe project is actively following work done in similar domains, both in academia and in other regional implementations. Researchers at Britain\u0027s University of Surrey are attempting to secure the digital archives of the UK’s National Archives on a DLT system while Estonia has built an innovative, blockchain-based solution for citizen identity management. (See also: Estonia Is Pushing for State-Backed Cryptocurrency.)These projects will provide crucial pointers to develop the required model, and a trial of DLT solutions for interagency evidence sharing is planned for later this year.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "On the Bitcoin blockchain, the nonce is a number used when a miner generates a hash from the block header to compare to the network difficulty target.\n\nA nonce is a numerical value used in a trial-and-error process to have a block added to the blockchain. The nonce is increased by a value of one for every attempt made. Finding the right combination of nonce and other values in the block consumes significant computational power. The nonce is one of a few values that can be altered to generate hashes for the competitive mining process.\n\nThe target difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a valid nonce. It is adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block generation rate.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is the Nonce?\n\nNonce, a portmanteau of \"number used only once,\" is a number that the Bitcoin mining program uses. It is included in the block header, then that information is hashed. If the resulting hexadecimal number adds up to a value of less than or equal to the network\u0027s difficulty target, the miner\u0027s block is added to the blockchain. Another is opened, and the process begins again.\n\nUnderstanding the Nonce\n\nA Bitcoin nonce is a 32-bit (or 4-byte) number miners use to attempt to generate a valid hash to produce a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain. The nonce is one of the fields included in the block header, which also includes:On the Bitcoin network, participants called miners compete to generate a hash that is less than or equal to the network target hash by repeatedly changing the nonce after each unsuccessful attempt.\n\nHashing refers to the process of applying a cryptographic hash function to information. The cryptographic hash function is a mathematical operation that takes block data and encrypts it by transforming it into a unique value, a fixed-length output of hexadecimal characters.\n\nThis hash value serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the block, ensuring that the block\u0027s contents remain unaltered. The nonce is the only variable in the block header that a miner can modify. By changing the nonce, a miner can change the hash of the block and calculate different possible solutions.\n\nFor example, this is the previous paragraph sent through an SHA-256 hashing algorithm:acd691b23cc47b03addf7329b0467c6190e758ee763d7d648af75b5c5ae73e3aBy adding a value of zero (the nonce) at the end of the paragraph, you get a different hexadecimal value:If you change that zero to a one, you\u0027d get this:This is how the nonce is used by the Bitcoin mining programming. The nonce value is increased by one with every attempt until a certain value is reached.\n\nThe first miner to find a valid hash under the network\u0027s difficulty target is awarded the block reward. Their block is broadcast to the network, added to the blockchain, and the process begins again.\n\nExtra Nonce and Time Stamp\n\nYou\u0027ll find in a block explorer that nonces generally only go up into the billions. For example, the nonce for block 841,948 was 1,614,498,317. Block 841,949 had a nonce of 4,218,083,700. A modern mining rig can generate many more hashes than this in less than one second.\n\nAdditionally, the nonce is limited to 32 bits (4 bytes), so it can only go up to a little more than 4.29 billion. It has to roll over to be useful because hashing is so fast. So, an addtional method was created after Bitcoin ASIC miners began ripping through the blockchain. Another number, called the extra nonce, is randomly generated and used in the coinbase data field. This value is added to the coinbase transaction space, which changes the Merkle root.\n\nThe Merkle root is part of the block header, so the block header hash changes. The extra nonce and the nonce are both manipulated to try to find the solution. If a solution cannot be found using either of these, the mining program allows the miners to adjust the timestamp. The combination of these three values allows the blockchain to keep its target of mining one block about every 10 minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners compete to find a nonce that meets the network\u0027s difficulty criteria. The information in a block header is sent through a hashing algorithm, resulting in a value that must be less than or equal to the network difficulty target.\n\nIn every attempt to meet the target, the nonce is increased by one. If it exceeds the 32-bit limit, it is rolled over, and the extra nonce and timestamp are used in combination with it until a miner is successful.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

    "title": "How Blockchain Can Solve Social Media Privacy \n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "LinkedIn and other social networks own all of your data. The next-generation social networks, based on ethereum blockchain, changes that.\n\n",
    "content": "The main drawbacks to social media are the loss of personal privacy, data protection and ownership of information. So the saying goes, “If You\u0027re Not Paying for It, You\u0027re the Product.” However, this \u0027centralized\u0027 control model of social media might be a thing of the past, thanks to blockchain technology. Specifically, ethereum, which brings the next-generation ‘decentralized’ models of social media. Ethereum is an open software platform that allows developers to build and make available decentralized applications. [1]A good example to illustrate this is Indorse, a rewards-based decentralized professional network on the ethereum blockchain. It was developed by Indorse Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based blockchain company. [2]Indorse uses a LinkedIn-style professional networking model, but members retain data ownership while earning rewards for sharing their professional skills and using the platform. Users are incentivized, in other words. The data ownership and reward system are based on the blockchain principles of decentralization and tokenization. Tokenization removes sensitive data from your business systems and replaces them with an undecipherable token that can store the original data in a secured cloud. [3]Through its platform, Indorse seeks to resolve three basic problems of social networking platforms: economic, autonomy and trust.\n\nThe economic conundrum of traditional social media is that a social media company can\u0027t make money without selling your data. And the actual providers of information, i.e. you, don\u0027t receive any monetary reward, which seems unfair.\n\nSocial media\u0027s autonomy problem refers to the concentrated control over the platform, which rests in just a few hands.\n\nThe trust problem springs from the autonomy problem because a centralized power makes all the decisions.\n\nA white paper written by Indorse highlights: “To be clear, we are not against advertising, and we are most certainly not against social media. However, we are against the centralization of social media. We believe the solution is a new model of social networks—a decentralized one that places ownership of information back in the hands of the members.”How Indorse WorksIndorse uses internal rewards, called Indorse Rewards, and a reputation system, dubbed Indorse Score, to incentivize members to not only add their skills or accomplishments but to endorse other members as well.\n\nIndorse is looking to engage members to actively participate on the platform. This is how members earn Indorse Rewards. The decentralized platform also involves advertisers, who purchase space using Indorse Tokens (IND Tokens) and are bought through an exchange. A part of these IND tokens will be shared with the members who create the content.\n\nIndorse completed its Token pre-sale, which ran from July 26, 2017 to July 29, 2017, receiving 13,807 ether (ETH) in the public pre-sale and approximately 4,000 more ether in private placements. Indorse held a Token sale on August 8, 2017 through Sept. 8, 2017. Here’s a snapshot from its fact sheet. [4]Rising Trend of ICOsRaising money for projects by selling “Tokens” via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is increasing in popularity. According to UK-based CoinSchedule, which provides cryptocurrency ICO statistics, US$20 billion has been raised in ICOs through October 4, 2018. This exceeds the venture capital investment in firms related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology. [5]In a 2017 report, The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that “issuers of distributed ledger or blockchain technology-based securities must register offers and sales of such securities unless a valid exemption applies.” The report further added, “Those participating in unregistered offerings also may be liable for violations of the securities laws. Additionally, securities exchanges providing for trading in these securities must register unless they are exempt. The purpose of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws is to ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny for investors\u0027 protection.”Eddy Travia, CEO and Co-founder of Coinsilium, shared his views with Investopedia: “The SEC message following its review of the DAO did not surprise the market nor the crypto community. The positive aspect of this message is the fact that tokens are being seriously considered by regulators across the world and a clear position by regulators will serve the token economy as a whole.\" He further added: “There are thousands of token smart contracts and thousands more will be created in the next six months. This puts immense pressure on founders to find adequate legal advisors, technical experts, and marketing consultants who have experience in a token generation event.”The Bottom LineIndorse creates a parallel decentralized version of a professional networking platform. Other such projects that are following suit will one day build a decentralized world in social media networking. Together, decentralized platforms and tokenization are emerging in a big way and if the trend continues—more regulations will be created over time.\n\n1. Ethereum2. Indorse3. Tokenization4.

The news marks the latest plunge by a large corporation in the blockchain space, as leaders across industries such as finance, retail, manufacturing and tech experiment with the underlying distributed ledger technology powering cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. (See also: JPMorgan Dives Into Crypto Space.)Faster Transactions Without Compromising Security\n\nOver the past 18 months, MUFG, the world\u0027s fourth-largest bank, has been working with Akamai to design a blockchain built on Akamai\u0027s cloud-based Intelligent Platform to handle 1 million transactions per second at latencies of less than 2 seconds. As the firms continue to work on enhancing the technology, they foresee the new service will be capable of processing 10 million transactions per second. Bitcoin, the world\u0027s largest digital coin by market capitalization, has been criticized for its long transaction times. The virtual currency can only process seven transactions per second at latencies exceeding 10 minutes.\n\nAkamai Labs chief technology officer Andy Champagne said the new blockchain service is best-suited for making traditional payments online. Ultimately, he says the service could pave the way for \"micropayment-type transactions\" in a world where connected devices on the Internet of Things (IoT) operate autonomously and make small orders for things such as detergent when the washer runs out of supplies. Champagne said the payment network application with Mitsubishi should roll out in early 2020.\n\nMUFG is no stranger to the blockchain. Earlier this year, it was first reported by local news publication Manichi that the Japanese financial giant would launch its own digital currency. The cryptocurrency, which will be pegged to the Japanese yen, is slated to launch this year. MUFG is also an investor in leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and has dabbled in blockchain projects with partners such as International Business Machines Corp.

    "summary": "Oasis Labs is a blockchain-based cloud platform that promises a combination of security and speed for smart contracts. It recently announced $45 million in a token pre-sale from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital.\n\n",
    "content": "The meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies in the last couple of years has been marred by hacking scandals and thefts. (See also: The Biggest Cryptocurrency Hacks This Year). Now a slew of top venture capitalists is funding a solution to the problem. Marquee venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, along with Accel Capital, and Pantera Capital were among the firms that participated in a $45 million token pre-sale for Oasis Labs, a Berkeley-based startup. It is headed by Dr. Dawn Song, a much-feted and awarded security researcher. Among her numerous achievements are winning the MacArthur Genius Grant and Guggenheim Fellowship. (See also: Fred Wilson And Howard Lindzon Are Securing The Blockchain).\n\nAccording to a description on its website, Oasis is a “privacy-first cloud computing platform on blockchain”. This means that the startup implements privacy technology on its cloud. That technology, which is known as Ekiden, is described in a research paper published by Song recently. Ekiden uses “Trusted Execution Environments”, which separate execution of smart contracts from consensus mechanisms. Thus, not all nodes are required to arrive at a consensus. Ekiden supports multiple blockchains and can be used to execute off-chain transactions (to speed up processing) as well. In its on-chain state, the technology enforces strong security properties.\n\n“We use a combination of trusted hardware and cryptographic techniques (such as secure multiparty computation) to enable smart contracts to compute over this encrypted data, without revealing anything about the underlying data. This is like doing computation inside a black box, which only outputs the computation result without showing what’s inside the black box,” Song told Techcrunch. The black box, in this case, is a piece of hardware called “secure enclave”, which is separate from the main blockchain and is used to execute smart contracts and generate cryptographic proof. Ari Juels, a Cornell Tech professor and coauthor of the paper, said an approach using secure enclaves was the only way to realize the “full potential” of blockchains.\n\nAn example of a potential application of Oasis Lab’s technology is in healthcare, where the confidentiality of patient data is of utmost importance. “Smart contracts could be used to encode privacy-related terms of use and let users selectively dole out access to their data. That would go a long way toward simplifying what is today a cumbersome process,” explains the MIT Technology Review. Oasis Labs plans to release its technology next year.\n\n",

    "content": "Companies thinking of riding the blockchain wave to a stock price jump might want to consider the Securities and Exchange Commission first.\n\nThe regulatory agency suspended trading in three Oregon-based firms last week after investigating their balance sheets and businesses. Cherubim Interests Inc. (CHIT), PDX Partners Inc. (PDXP), and Victura Construction Group Inc. (VICT) are penny stocks that trade in OTC markets. They had published press releases in January claiming to have acquired assets from a private equity firm that has interests in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in its businesses.\n\n“There are questions regarding the nature of the companies’ business operations and the value of their assets, including in press releases issued beginning in early January 2018,” the SEC wrote in a post on its site, adding that trading in Cherubim had also been stopped due to delinquency in filing of annual and quarterly reports.\n\n“This is a reminder that investors should give heightened scrutiny to penny stock companies that have switched their focus to the latest business trend, such as cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, or initial coin offerings,” said Michele Wein Layne, Director of the Los Angeles Regional Office. But Patrick Johnson, who is listed as the CEO of all three companies, has said they were not involved in “the cryptocurrency space.\"Valuations of companies that have tacked onto the blockchain and cryptocurrency craze have jumped in recent times. But the SEC has taken an increasingly strident stance against such companies and cracked down on their operations. For example, it halted trading in UBI Blockchain Internet last month due to “unusual and unexplained market activity.”In a Congressional hearing recently, SEC Chair Jay Clayton also came out against initial coin offerings (ICOs) and said that every ICO that he had seen was a security token. Unlike utility tokens, which are unregulated, security tokens fall under SEC purview. Cohen\u0027s statement could be construed as a mark of the agency’s future intentions.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Open protocol lets developers take part in the API economy without sacrificing privacy, while retaining the ability to maximize profits.\n\n",
    "content": "The role of a CIO (chief information officer) in the corporate world has evolved over time, keeping pace with the rate of innovation characteristic in technology and business. From the position’s original mandate to steward the IT department and ensure a company’s systems ran smoothly, today\u0027s CIOs are expected to not simply enact IT platforms, but to understand and create new business models that employ existing technology and external solutions for unique tasks.\n\nAs technology moves away from the monolithic model and into a mix-and-match paradigm, APIs have become a key component for success. APIs (application program interfaces) are sub-functions, or small applications, that allow developers to use different tools in a single solution by enhancing communication between different components. In essence, APIs act as communicators between two pieces of software, enabling both to work as if they were a single program.\n\nAPIs have become increasingly popular tools, with companies like Facebook, Amazon, SalesForce, and more launching their own APIs which allow companies to access some of their services without having to fully migrate into their ecosystem. This new paradigm has led to the rise of what some experts call the \"API economy,\" a model that enhances a company’s bottom line by improving interoperability and thus creating new systems from existing ones.\n\nMuch in the same way businesses today are building new platforms not from single sources but from a variety of applications, blockchain technology offers a more democratic and efficient way to construct new solutions.\n\nBlockchain is founded upon the idea of democratization and decentralization, two notions that are inherently built into API development paradigms. Like APIs were the catalyst for a technological revolution, the technology that supports cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has shown vast potential to lead a new wave of innovative development. (See also: What is Blockchain Technology?)The First API Economy: Centralization Wins\n\nThe concept of APIs was borne out of the necessity evolving technology brought about. Whereas legacy systems were dependent on a single monolithic application that handled every aspect of an operation, APIs offered developers the ability to simply plug in existing solutions from other systems to gain functionality without sacrificing efficiency. Moreover, they presented companies the ability to integrate tools with proven track records for key functionality all whilst shaping a more decentralized environment for innovation.\n\nThe API economy came about as companies understood that more than simply developers’ tools, APIs delivered a way to expedite business processes, use existing technology to produce novel platforms, and establish a more connected and interoperable environment for applications. In an increasingly cloud-based world, APIs offer an easy way to connect services and create solutions that can employ the best of what’s readily available. For many companies, this model is highly attractive, as it allows them to deploy existing technology, but also increase their footprint and revenues—as companies such as Facebook, SalesForce, and others have already done.\n\nOne excellent early example of both the rise and stagnation of the current API economy is LinkedIn. Initially, the company opened several APIs that let developers use LinkedIn tools in a variety of ways. The program was highly successful and allowed users to share large portions of information from their accounts within other services.\n\nHowever, after it became too popular, the company announced a decision to shutter most of its APIs, or heavily restrict them to paying members, killing off what was a vibrant developer ecosystem using the company’s tools. LinkedIn’s reaction highlights a problematic dichotomy in the industry.\n\nAPIs are built to remove centralization. They’re designed to create interconnected systems that share data quickly and support a more efficient ecosystem governed only by what’s possible, and not what’s allowed. The other major trend in the tech world, and one LinkedIn displayed when closing off their API library, was the fear embodied by major companies surrounding losing their grip as gatekeepers of the world’s data. LinkedIn was unhappy API users had the ability—given by itself—to simply move data they could use for monetization from the company’s services.\n\nBlockchain and API Economies 2.0\n\nBlockchain has been hailed as a revolutionary technology in many industries, but one of its most valuable functions is as a democratizing tool for development. The technology removes the idea that data can be controlled by a few central nodes in a network.\n\nDue to its decentralized and open ledger, every user on the network has access to all data and can use it how they see fit. Closely related to this concept, and one central to a true API economy is the matter of trust.\n\nIn the current model, APIs collect data about users that is owned by the company whose API is being used. For instance, Google Maps still gets to keep the information collected by other apps that use their API and has the sole rights to monetize it. Using blockchain, this would not be possible, as all information isn’t stored centrally, but rather distributed simultaneously to every node’s ledger, creating a fully trust-capable network dynamic.\n\nBlockchain’s built-in trust mechanism and its informational advantages mean that APIs can work optimally, and indeed many blockchain projects are built almost entirely using APIs. Request Network, for instance, is built using Civic, Aragon, Kyber.Network, and other tools. Similarly, there are innovative solutions that permit companies to freely move information around and retain control of it, instead of leaving it to gatekeepers.\n\nDock.io, for example, allows users to connect to major centralized sources such as LinkedIn, Upwork, and other similar sites and control the information displayed on them. It also empowers individuals to take their information with them and migrate to different platforms if necessary. This ability to move data is vital for the new API economy, where informational flows are not restricted or limited by a single entity. As long as users can control their information, the company’s tools can be integrated into any platform to create a professional knowledge exchange.\n\nSimilarly, blockchain startup Wibson enables users to control their information and decide how it should be monetized. In the current API economy, control over user data remains firmly in the hands of gatekeepers. However, tools like Wibson, which lets users sell validated data to media sources without sacrificing their privacy, offer a different model for APIs, allowing platforms to collect user data without running into ethical dilemmas about control and infringing on privacy.\n\nMat Travizano from Wibson offered his take:Adding Trust, Removing Barriers\n\nThe API economy is not going anywhere. Currently, there are over 17,000 APIs available for use (as reported by ProgrammableWeb), though most of them have not integrated blockchain. Even so, the market has seen larger players either close their access or use APIs as a means to expand their data mining and monetization efforts.\n\nDespite the model’s popularity, though, this continued centralization of power and control resting in the hands of a few large corporations means they effectively control innovation. (See also: Top Blockchain Startups to Watch in 2018.)Blockchain can help resolve these issues by adding trust, self-control, and the ability to employ democratic approaches towards developing new applications. The more open protocol lets developers take part in the API economy without sacrificing their privacy while retaining the ability to maximize their profits by keeping the data they use and produce.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "content": "The CFA Institute, which offers a certification of expertise in finance, is adding blockchain and cryptocurrencies to its curriculum next year. According to a Bloomberg report, the Institute plans to release material for the new topics in August this year. (See also: What Is A CFA?)Reading about blockchain and cryptocurrencies will be included in a topic called Fintech in Investment Management. The Institute is also adding a discussion related to cryptocurrencies in its reading on professional ethics. Regulatory uncertainty about cryptocurrencies should make this an interesting topic of study for students who focus on financial regulation. The cryptocurrency industry’s numerous hacks and scandals should also provide fertile material for students to study the absence of ethics in cryptocurrencies. Stephen Horan, managing director of general education and curriculum at CFA Institute, told Bloomberg that the field of cryptocurrencies was “advancing more quickly than other fields”. “This is not a passing fad,” he said.\n\nAn Education In Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe CFA Institute\u0027s decision to include cryptocurrencies and blockchain in its curriculum represents a further mainstreaming of the industry. But this one might be one of the most important since it will help demystify cryptocurrencies to students.\n\nAs much as they’ve gained popularity in the last year, cryptocurrencies still remain a puzzle for most investors. This is partly because they combine two separate but related fields: finance and computer science. The concepts underlying cryptocurrencies are those of finance but their execution is uniquely based on computer science. The melding of two different fields has resulted in an industry that has become infamous for being opaque and difficult to understand. While analyst firms have offered differing interpretations of bitcoin, a standardized framework to assess and value cryptocurrencies is still absent. The rapid pace of new developments within the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems, such as Lightning Network, has further complicated matters. The CFA Institute’s initiative should be evaluated within this context. (See also: Bitcoin Is The New Gold: Goldman Sachs).\n\nThe course’s emphasis on blockchain will also serve students well. “It will be beneficial for us, since there’s been a huge expansion and adoption of crypto in our investment universe,” Kayden Lee, a fund analyst intern in Singapore told Bloomberg. “But more importantly the focus is on fintech and blockchain. How it works to improve, unravel or even disrupt certain sectors.”Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "summary": "SALT loans allow borrowers to maintain ownership of their blockchain assets, while also gaining access to cash via a loan.\n\nSALT (Secured Automated Lending Technology) Lending is a company that offers loans to members who put up cryptocurrency as collateral. SALT Lending provides personal and business loans. SALT loans allow borrowers to maintain ownership of their digital assets, while also gaining access to cash through the loan. If the cryptocurrency’s price declines, a breach of the loan-to-value (LTV) threshold can occur, resulting in a “collateral maintenance call,” similar to a margin call. Loan terms are 12, 36, or 60 months.

California also suspended SALT’s lending license for that state. After an infusion of $64 million in capital in February 2023, the Denver-based lender announced that it had “embarked on a growth plan that we believe positions us for even greater success in the future.”\n\n",
    "content": "What Is SALT Blockchain-Based Lending?\n\nSALT is an acronym for Secured Automated Lending Technology. SALT Lending provides a platform where members can take out a loan using cryptocurrency as collateral.\n\nSALT was founded in 2016 by a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts to offer crypto-backed lending and provide flexibility for investors who hold digital assets. This article explains how it works.\n\nHow SALT Blockchain-Based Lending Works\n\nSALT Lending provides personal and business loans to members who put up blockchain assets as collateral. Users buy a membership to the SALT Lending platform by purchasing a SALT token, which is the platform’s cryptocurrency. When someone becomes a member, they can borrow money from an extensive network of lenders. SALT’s minimum loan amount is $1,000, and loans can be used for any purpose, such as paying down credit card debt or buying a car.\n\nSALT is built on an ERC-20 smart contract. Smart contracts are contracts that, in addition to stipulating the terms of the agreement, also enforce and execute on those terms with cryptographic code. ERC-20 is a standard that any Ethereum token contracts must implement to facilitate the exchange of tokens.\n\nBorrowers can only use blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as collateral. In other words, the borrower must have the ownership of their crypto recorded on a public, permissioned blockchain. Some of the digital assets that can be used as collateral for SALT loans are:Following the approval of the loan, the borrower sends collateral to the SALT collateral wallet. In return, the loan proceeds are transferred to the borrower’s bank account. The digital assets held as collateral remain the property of the borrower, meaning any price changes of the assets belong to them.\n\nDuring the lifetime of the loan, the borrower must make timely, periodic payments to the lender and once the loan has been repaid—called loan completion—the borrower’s collateral is made available for withdrawal.\n\nRequirements for SALT Loan Approval\n\nSALT loans do not require a credit check or credit score for the borrower, as many bank loans do. That’s because the crypto assets used to secure the loan can be liquidated if the borrower fails to repay the loan—a process called default.\n\nEligibility is based primarily on the value of the borrower’s blockchain assets. However, SALT does perform verification of each borrower, to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Client (KYC) regulations. Once a member has been deemed eligible, SALT allows the loan application to move forward.\n\nSALT’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios\n\nSince the collateral being used to secure the loan is a cryptocurrency, it can fluctuate as the market price of the crypto changes over time.\n\nIf the value of the cryptocurrency rises, the borrower can, if they wish, use it to obtain additional funds from the lender. The borrower can also do nothing and use the additional proceeds from the increased value of the digital assets to eventually pay off the loan.\n\nHowever, if the price of the cryptocurrency decreases significantly, it can lead to a breach of the loan-to-value (LTV) threshold, resulting in a “collateral maintenance call,” which is similar to a margin call on a traditional brokerage account. That’s when the broker requests additional funds from a customer who has purchased stocks on margin (with borrowed money from the broker), due to a decline in the value of their collateral.\n\nThe loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is calculated by dividing the loan principal amount by the current U.S. dollar value of the digital currency in the SALT wallet. The initial LTV ratio is based on the terms within the original loan agreement.\n\nFor example, if a $100,000 loan is secured by $155,000 in Bitcoins, then the initial loan-to-value ratio would be 65% (100,000 ÷ 155,000 \u003d 0.65). In other words, the loan amount represents 65% of the value of the Bitcoin assets held as collateral.\n\nThe initial loan-to-value ratio will decrease over time as the borrower pays down the loan. However, if Bitcoin’s price declined significantly, then the loan-to-value ratio would increase. For example, if the total value of the collateral decreased to $110,000 due to a fall in Bitcoin, then the loan-to-value ratio would increase to about 91%.\n\nThe borrower would then have to provide more collateral by depositing an additional amount of the cryptocurrency or else make a payment to reduce the outstanding loan balance. The loan-to-value ratio is tracked by a smart contract, which calculates and updates the ratio throughout the life of the loan based on the changes in the price of the digital asset held as collateral and the various payments made by the borrower.\n\nThese are the loan-to-value ratios that would trigger a margin call for a SALT loan:If the value of the digital asset held as collateral crashes and the loan-to-value ratio reaches 90.91%, then SALT converts the entire crypto portfolio into a U.S. dollar-based stablecoin—a process called automatic stabilization. Once the loan-to-value ratio has been reduced to 83.33% or lower, by either making a payment to reduce the amount outstanding or depositing additional collateral, the borrower can then reenter the market by converting the stablecoin back into their original digital currency.\n\nThe stabilization process helps to preserve the value of the cryptocurrency assets held as collateral during market downturns. Stabilization also provides the borrower with time to decide when they want to reenter the market and purchase the original digital asset.\n\nSALT Loan Length, Interest, and Fees\n\nThe loan term can be 12, 36, or 60 months, and SALT does not charge an origination fee for setting up the loan. Borrowers pay interest on the loan, as they would on any other loan. Rates recently ranged from 0.95% to 9.99%, depending on loan length and LTV. Also, if stabilization is triggered, SALT charges a 5% processing fee.\n\nThe deposited funds held as collateral do not earn interest.\n\nBenefits of SALT Loans\n\nA likely SALT borrower would be someone who believes that the digital assets they use as collateral will increase in value over time or at least remain the same. (In crypto jargon, that makes them HODLers.) SALT loans allow them to maintain ownership and benefit from any gain in their digital currency’s value, while also obtaining cash for other purposes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSALT blockchain-based lending gives investors access to cash without having to sell their cryptocurrency holdings. However, there are risks to the borrower since cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly. If the digital asset used as collateral drops in value, then the borrower may need to pay down a portion of the loan or deposit additional crypto assets as security.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

The report, which also claims that the U.K. has industrial and governmental appetite for new blockchain projects, suggests that the U.K. could be at the forefront globally by 2022. With more than £500 million in blockchain-related investments made in the U.K. markets in the past two years, it\u0027s not hard to imagine this being the case.\n\nDAG Global CEO Sean Kiernan believes that the traditional financial world of the U.K. is primed to integrate with the digital currency space. He suggests that \"the U.K. is a major global financial hub and in recent years has become a fintech leader as well. At the same time, it is starting to demonstrate significant potential to become a leader in blockchain technologies and the crypto economy.

Carney described cryptocurrencies as \"failing,\" adding that digital tokens\u0027 \"extreme volatility reflects that the cryptocurrencies have neither intrinsic value nor external backing.\"BOE Deputy Governor Sam Woods echoed this sentiment last month, suggesting that \"crypto-assets have exhibited high price volatility and relative illiquidity ... many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks.\"In order for the study above to come to pass, regulators\u0027 opinions on digital currencies will likely have to change.

    "summary": "The clock is ticking until eSIMs are the new status quo, and blockchain will help them arrive precisely on time.\n\nCompanies are exploring blockchain technology in order to save their customers time and hassle with physical SIM cards by offering fully-digital eSIM options. Blockchain is a relatively new technology, but one that is widely used and fairly secure. Some customers still prefer the ease of switching out physical SIM cards between phones, especially when traveling. eSIMS can be instantly assigned and downloaded once the carrier\u0027s terms and conditions are met and payment is processed. Currently, SIMs are operating on technology that hasn\u0027t changed much since it was introduced in 1991.\n\nBlockchain has no central database to exploit, which is one of the main reasons it is so secure.\n\n",
    "content": "The telecommunications industry has experienced more than its fair share of change, and by necessity has evolved extremely quickly. As computing and communications have merged, the industry has had to deal with debates about privacy and data ownership, and major companies have quickly morphed into the giants of today.\n\nAt the same time, the technology that powers telecommunications is rapidly changing, and old standards are being challenged. The SIM card, one of the staples of mobile phones, is facing obsolescence as digital solutions offer significant improvements. With the help of new concepts like blockchain, the smartphones of tomorrow may look familiar, but their technology will be a massive leap forward.\n\nCombining Communications Tech With Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain revolution continues to gather steam, and for good reason. Blockchain’s distributed ledger is a powerful system for democratically organizing the nodes—or users—on its network while rewarding them for lending processing power and other resources.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralized ledger has laid the foundation for ideas that include a decentralized cloud storage network, self-sovereign banks, and transparent voting systems. More importantly, however, it could also radically change the way our smartphones operate.\n\nDespite the bells and whistles that smartphones offer today, the technology that drives them is surprisingly outdated. Most smartphones still use the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module), a physical memory card that was first developed back in 1991. It holds the identity and cellular network details of each user, including their phone number, name, service provider, and other information.\n\nSIMs are a relatively basic way to upgrade a phone as one simply removes the card and plugs it into a new device. Switching providers isn’t as easy and still requires customers to request a new SIM card be mailed to them or to drive to a brick-and-mortar store for a new SIM.\n\nWhile other hardware-based storage tools upgraded to digital technology—much like video games went from cartridges to digital downloads—SIM technology remains essentially the same as it did when it was created. Now, its dominance is being challenged by eSIM technology, which was first deployed by Google. With blockchain’s help, it’s set to hit the wider market and make a larger splash.\n\neSIM Technology and Blockchain Create New Markets\n\nThe eSIM is essentially software that holds the same information as a regular SIM but on a digital module instead of a physical chip. Apple already deploys it in its Apple Watch and iPad products, which tout slimness and couldn’t afford to incorporate even the tiniest of memory cards.\n\nThough the move was mostly intended to cut out cell service providers, Apple and Google first showed the efficacy of the eSIM model by selling their devices without a pre-loaded service provider. Customers could simply choose from any number of providers and data packages once connected to Wi-Fi, saving them precious time and effort.\n\nConsumers also save money with eSIMs, which is a threat to service providers who charge installation fees and upsell relevant products in their branches. If centralized companies like Apple and Google can use eSIMs to disrupt this lucrative cash flow and simultaneously offer more flexibility for consumers, it’s easy to imagine what the technology can accomplish when combined with blockchain. Keepgo recognized the opportunity early and is putting the plan into motion.\n\nSoon, devices with eSIMs will be able to connect to KeepGo’s distributed marketplace, where users can enjoy a bigger selection of data plans with greater transparency. Instead of purchasing the right to surf from a third party, users will be able to choose their provider in a decentralized network. The twist is that other users are the providers and share their data with others via KeepGo’s Decentralized Megabyte Exchange.\n\nSimilarly, blockchain-based services have started popping up looking to be the first to corner the emerging market. Dent Wireless, for instance, offers a service that lets users purchase mobile data directly on their mobile phones, as well as send data. QLink, another blockchain telecommunications pioneer, is building out its infrastructure to provide tools like wi-fi sharing, mobile data, and even enterprise-to-peer services.\n\nFighting for the Future\n\neSIM and blockchain are disruptive technologies, yet they face significant resistance from entrenched industry players. Even so, they’re finding their way into the world thanks to consumer-minded innovators and companies that see the value of changing with the times.\n\nDespite the sometimes-slow progress, both technologies have long since secured their continued existence. The clock is ticking until eSIMs are the new status quo, and blockchain—itself pushing through various industry obstacles—will help them arrive precisely on time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\neSIMs are not a new idea, but rolling them out to the general public via blockchain is relatively new. Telecom giants like Verizon, Telus, and Vodafone have all explored the potential of the disruptive technology but as of 2022, almost all phone users are still operating their lines on physical SIM cards.\n\n",

(See also: Can Blockchain Become the Global Standard?)Finance Leads in Blockchain Adoption\n\nThe financial sector will lead blockchain spending during 2018, said the report. Its $552 million expenditure during 2018 will be largely driven by the banking industry.\n\nThe next biggest blockchain spender during 2018 comes from distribution and services sector, which will contribute $379 million, aided by investments from the retail and professional services industries. The manufacturing and resources sector, which is expected to invest $334 million in 2018, takes the next spot, which will see increased blockchain adoption from the discrete and process manufacturing industries. The highest growth rate is forecasted to be within the process manufacturing (78.8% CAGR), professional services (77.7% CAGR) and banking (74.7% CAGR).\n\nThe report further predicts that use cases for cross-border payments \u0026 settlements are expected to see the largest blockchain spending in 2018 ($193 million). It will be followed by lot/lineage provenance ($160 million), and trade finance \u0026 post-trade/transaction settlements ($148 million). The study predicts that these three use cases will continue to remain the largest in terms of overall spending in 2022.\n\nGlobal Blockchain Adoption\n\nGeographically, the United States is expected to lead the pack with more than 36% of global spending throughout the forecast period. It will be followed by the Western Europe, China, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) and the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn terms of the highest growth rate, Japan and Canada will lead with CAGRs of 108.7% and 86.7%, respectively.\n\n\"Enthusiasm for blockchain continues to be universally shared across regions as businesses and organizations alike continue to explore the technology’s potential business application,\" said Stacey Soohoo, research manager with IDC\u0027s Customer Insights \u0026 Analysis team. \"Regulatory concerns and industry standards continue to hinder widespread adoption as governments around the globe work with enterprises to formulate policies and governance.

(See also: How the SWIFT System Works.)Recent SWIFT hacks have not helped matters and further compromised the network’s integrity. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the traditional cross-border payments industry is ripe for disruption. “Interbank payment systems such as SWIFT are old, inflexible, slow, and increasingly prone to cyberattacks at a time when banks are under tremendous pressure to cut costs and protect customer data from hackers, which blockchain could achieve,” the bank posted on its site earlier this year.\n\nThe emergence of rival systems based on blockchain, such as Ripple – which has more than 75 banks as its members already – is also not helping matters. Large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. (JPM), have also formed networks among themselves to develop cross-border payment systems based on blockchain technology. (See also: JPMorgan Unveils Blockchain Money Transfer Project.)SWIFT And Blockchain\n\nGiven the similarity in both payment systems\u0027 technologies, it would make sense for SWIFT to investigate blockchain. Indeed, the messaging network has initiated blockchain projects of its own. The consortium in January announced a proof of concept to test reconciliation of databases for cross-border payments in real time; by August, the project met its objectives. But that success came with a catch. In an interview with Coindesk, SWIFT’s R\u0026D head Damien Vanderveken said its solution would require a significant infrastructure overhaul for banks that had already invested in centralized solutions. “The business value depends on the level of automation of the participants,” he said.\n\nThe differences between SWIFT and blockchain came into sharp contrast at two competing conferences held at the same time last week. One of the conferences was organized by Ripple and the other by SWIFT. According to reports, SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt compared the current enthusiasm for bitcoin, which is based on blockchain, to the 17th-century “Tulip bubble” mania and barely mentioned the company’s own blockchain project. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella set him right by asking the company to build “useful” blockchain applications.\n\nDoes This Mean The End Of SWIFT?\n\nTo be sure, the share of payment-based messages within the SWIFT ecosystem has been declining even as security and treasury transactions have been gaining share.\n\nHowever, the company’s SWIFT for Corporates solution, which is used by banks to exchange secure messages about financial information, has seen rapid growth from 579 corporate entities which signed up for the solution in 2009, to 1,405 in 2014. Traction for its new product and uptick in revenue from alternate streams means that SWIFT might be reinventing itself rather than becoming obsolete in a blockchain world.\n\n",

    "summary": "Nasdaq plans to delist Long Blockchain, saying it deceived investors by fraudulently changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea.\n\n",
    "content": "Long Blockchain, the company which began life as Long Island Iced Tea Corp., is in hot water. Months ago, the beverage company made headlines when it abruptly renamed itself Long Blockchain. Detractors said the flailing company was trying to capitalize on the fervor over cryptocurrencies. (See more: Long Island Iced Tea Soars After Changing Its Name to Long Blockchain.)Sure enough, upon changing its name, Long Blockchain\u0027s stock price skyrocketed. Now, Nasdaq is accusing Long Blockchain of lying to its investors, and is making moves to delist the company. (See also: SEC Halts Trading In 3 Firms Linked To Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.)As it is, Long Blockchain \"remains out of compliance with Nasdaq\u0027s rules for market value requirements,\" according to a report by CoinDesk. In order to maintain its listing in the exchange, the company must maintain a market cap at or above $35 million on at least 10 consecutive business days.\n\nMarket Cap Hovering Below Nasdaq\u0027s Required Minimum\n\nLong Blockchain has until April 9 to meet these requirement. But earlier today, Long Blockchain\u0027s market cap hovered around $31.6 million, a decline of about $2 million from earlier in the week. Today, the company\u0027s stock is trading around $3 per share. At its peak, the stock traded for more than double that amount.\n\nLong Blockchain turned heads when it abruptly announced plans to change its focus from beverages to blockchain in December 2017. Given the sudden nature of the shift and inconsistencies regarding the company\u0027s market cap and information related to investors, Nasdaq says it has reason to be concerned about the company\u0027s honesty. (See also: SEC May Crack Down on Firms Misusing \u0027Blockchain\u0027 Name.)Plans to Appeal\n\nFor its part, Long Blockchain is not taking the news that Nasdaq aims to delist it from the exchange lightly. The company is appealing the delisting decision. According to a letter from February 21, Long Blockchain believes Nasdaq \"had determined to delist the Company\u0027s securities.\"The company added that \"the notification letter stated that the Staff believed that the Company made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology, thereby raising concerns about the Company\u0027s suitability for exchange listing.\"Long Blockchain said it \"strongly disagrees\" with that determination, and has appealed Nasdaq\u0027s decision to a hearings panel. However, because of its sputtering market cap, even if Long Blockchain wins the appeal regarding having misled investors, it may still be delisted for other reasons.

    "content": "The World Bank has chosen Commonwealth Bank of Australia to be the sole arranger of the world’s first blockchain bond.\n\nThe blockchain bond dubbed bond-i will be created, allocated, transferred and managed using distributed ledger technology or blockchain, which is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. The World Bank said that investor interest in bond-i, which stands for blockchain operated new debt instrument, has been strong with plans to launch the transaction following consultation with more investors. The World Bank didn’t provide a date for when the blockchain based bond will launch. Bond-i is also a nod to Bondi Beach in Sydney. (See more: Which Industries Will Blockchain Disrupt Next?)Blockchain To Streamline Processes In Capital Markets\n\nAccording to the World Bank blockchain has the potential to streamline processes in debt capital markets, making it easier to raise capital and trade securities. It also improves operational efficiencies and enhances regulatory oversight, the World Bank said in a press release announcing the new bond. It noted that it issues anywhere from $50 billion to $60 billion in bonds annually and prides itself on being an innovator in the capital markets. It pointed to the fact that it was the first to issue a bond in a global format in September of 1989 and was the first to launch an e-bond in January of 2000. “We believe that emerging technologies, equally offer transformative, yet prudent possibilities for us to continue to innovate, respond to investor needs and strengthen markets,” Arunma Oteh, World Bank Treasurer, said in the prepared remarks. Oteh noted that the World Bank has been working with Commonwealth Bank of Australia for several months on the initiative and is now in the position to launch its first blockchain bond transaction. (See more: How Blockchain Can Protect the Global Economy.)Blockchain Getting More Uses\n\nThe bond-i blockchain platform was built and developed by the CBA Blockchain Centre of Excellence. A private Ethereum-based blockchain is being used for the efforts but CBA said it could look at other options as this area of blockchain takes off. “We know blockchain has the potential to revolutionize financial services and markets, and this transaction is a significant step towards that future state,”Sophie Gilder, head of Blockchain, Innovation Labs, CBA in the press release. The move on the part of Commonwealth Bank of Australia comes as the Australian Securities Exchange is gearing up in 2020 to start using blockchain to clear and settle equity trades in an effort to save money.\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin\u0027s fortunes may have dipped, but career prospects for those working in the blockchain industry are on an upswing.\n\n",
    "content": "In recent times, blockchain has become a magic word for organizations, who are applying the technology to solve complex problems. Some of that magic seems to be rubbing off on career prospects for those working in the industry.\n\nThere are numerous data points which testify to the growing demand and salaries for blockchain developers. Glassdoor, a jobs review site, found that demand for blockchain-related jobs this year increased by 300 percent as compared to last year. New York accounted for the maximum number of openings in the technology followed by San Francisco and San Jose. Chicago and Seattle rounded out the top five. Upwork, a site for freelancers, stated that demand for freelancers with a “blockchain” asset grew by 3,500 percent this year as compared to last year.\n\nThe skyrocketing demand for blockchain-related jobs has also translated into a significant salary bump. Online jobs site Hired told CNBC that average salary for blockchain developers is between $150,000 and $175,000 – a range that is approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers. That salary range puts blockchain developers on par with another in-demand group – engineers with expertise in artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a skill set, blockchain is a combination of existing programming technologies and concepts, such as object-oriented programming and ledger economics, with an understanding of cryptography. As such, demand for other roles, such as product managers and requirements specialists, within the industry is also growing.\n\nWhat’s Behind The High Salaries For Blockchain Developers?\n\nHigh salaries for workers in blockchain are a function of increased demand and short supply.\n\nWhile blockchain’s benefits are still unproven, breathless media coverage has ensured that the technology is on everyone’s radar. Established firms have embraced blockchain and announced initiatives specifically related to the technology. For example, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has started a blockchain-as-a-service (BAAS) platform within Azure, its cloud division. IBM Corp. (IBM) has also launched a division dedicated to blockchain, basing it on an open-source fabric Hyperledger. Even social media behemoth Facebook Inc. (FB) has formed a group to explore blockchain’s uses in its business. A shortage in skills supply has helped further inflate salaries for blockchain experts. Several new initiatives are being launched to plug the gap in supply, from bounty programs to encourage developers to boot camps introducing the technology to developers. Universities are also in on the game and have launched online courses to educate professionals.\n\n",

The technology, thanks to its decentralized structure, is more difficult to hack. Issues that need to be overcome include its energy consumption, relative lack of speed, and the fact that each block in the chain can hold only so much data.\n\nThe number of 401(k)s that have been forgotten, according to estimates from Capitalize.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, could actually change the way we manage 401(k)s. Pundits claim blockchain represents the biggest breakthrough since the internet, with the potential to improve just about everything in our lives, including our health and bank balance. Here\u0027s how it might also increase the amount of money we have to live on in retirement.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nIf you\u0027ve kept up to date with the latest financial and investment innovations, you\u0027ve probably heard of blockchain. It is a digital ledger that records anything that needs to be logged and verified as having taken place securely and simultaneously across a network of computers. Every time something new happens, a record is automatically added to this type of online Excel document. That record is safe, cannot be tampered with, and is theoretically accessible to everyone.\n\nIn short, this technology offers a much more potentially secure, trustworthy, efficient, and organized way to record data than we currently have. While that might not sound particularly special, it is actually a pretty big deal.\n\nWhat Impact Can Blockchain Have on 401(k)s?\n\nOne thing that could really do with being saved by a technological breakthrough is the U.S. retirement system. Increasing life expectancy, mismanagement, low mobility, a lack of trust, too many stakeholders, and limited transparency are just a few of the issues that threaten to leave a significant portion of the population without the resources to live comfortably when they leave the workforce.\n\nBlockchain, if it lives up to its potential, could help to reduce these headwinds and breathe life back into retirement savings. Below we list some of the key ways that this highly hyped technology might make one of the darkest clouds hanging over the economy go away.\n\nFaith in the financial institutions that manage retirement plans isn’t exactly soaring and part of that is due to a lack of transparency. Inconsistent information, hidden charges, and the use of jargon cause many people to put off saving for retirement.\n\nA shared decentralized ledger could perhaps help to remedy this problem. Having everything stored in one easy-to-access place would give Americans a clearer picture of their retirement assets and perhaps incentivize them to invest more. A better-informed population would also be more likely to make smarter investment decisions and not just go with the default option.\n\nThese days people have a tendency to change jobs fairly frequently. In some cases, when they leave a job, they also leave an old pension behind.\n\nIn the U.S., it is basically up to employees to keep tabs on all their 401(k)s from previous jobs or merge them into their new employer’s plans. There is no pension database that keeps track of workers’ total defined contributions or someone who takes care of making sure retirement savings move where the employee goes.\n\nSadly, this means it is quite common for people to lose track of where all their retirement accounts are held and forfeit some of the money they worked hard to put aside for their later years. In 2017, NBC News reported that American workers could be losing a collective $2 trillion in retirement savings simply by failing to roll over their 401(k) savings accounts when they change jobs. In 2021, the financial services company Capitalize said there were 24.3 million forgotten 401(k) accounts worth about 20% of all 401(k) assets in the U.S.\n\nBlockchain could put an end to this. With this technology, it would be possible to keep track of all of our retirement accounts in one easy-to-access place.\n\nOne of the most hyped things about blockchain is that it doesn’t require a third-party intermediary such as banks and clearinghouses to validate transactions. When money or something else changes hands, it instantaneously gets logged on multiple computers that in theory are accessible for all to see.\n\nThe significance of this is huge. Cutting out the middlemen should trigger faster results and lower costs. With fewer people taking a cut, more of your money is invested, resulting in a bigger pension pot.\n\nHaving all your information related to retirement savings stored in one easy-to-access location should arguably put pressure on financial institutions to work harder to retain clients. A common problem today is that retirement plans are seldom monitored by their owners. Should blockchain live up to its promise and change this, asset managers will no longer be able to take customers for granted. When the threat of them shopping around, jumping ship, and demanding more becomes reality, providers will, in theory, be forced to offer more competitive terms, hopefully resulting in lower costs and higher quality products.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a spike in the number of 401(k)s that have been hacked. Most attacks lead to personal information being stolen, although online criminals are now increasingly taking money from people’s plans, too.\n\nBlockchain could help put an end to this. Information on the blockchain network is located in a shared database that exists on millions of computers rather than in one central location. According to experts in the field, that decentralized structure makes it more difficult to hack.\n\nHurdles Still to Overcome\n\nThe benefits of blockchain have been touted for several years now, yet the technology has still not been widely adopted. Why is that? As we’ve seen with other big breakthroughs in the past, it takes time for a potentially game-changing invention to be transformed into a system that can be safely and efficiently used by the masses.\n\nIn 2017, the research firm Gartner predicted that blockchain was still 10 years away from going mainstream. It said five to 10 years in 2019, indicating we still have a way to go before this technology is tried, tested, and ready to become part of our everyday lives.\n\nSome of the biggest issues that need to be ironed out before blockchain can feasibly become scalable for widespread use include the amount of energy it consumes to function, its relative lack of speed, and the fact that each block in the chain can only hold so much data.\n\nAnother concern is that uniting 401(k)s with blockchain could lead cryptocurrencies to become a permanent fixture in retirement plans. The U.S. Department of Labor, the body in charge of making sure that employer retirement accounts meet the minimum standards set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), has made it fairly clear that it’s against this idea due to the speculative and volatile nature of these digital currencies.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain has the potential to vastly improve the living standards of the retired portion of the population. Greater transparency and efficiency should boost engagement, lower costs, and ensure the money we put aside each month is put to its best use and given the greatest chance to grow in value.\n\nThe bad news is it could take a while for that exciting prospect to become reality. As things stand, blockchain still has plenty of hurdles to overcome before becoming ready for the mainstream. There’s also a chance that it will never make it that far and be superseded by something else, as yet unknown, that is even more capable.\n\n",

    "content": "The Chinese government\u0027s view of the cryptocurrency space, including blockchain technology, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and related projects and companies, has consistently made headlines for several months. News that the Chinese authorities were planning a crackdown on exchanges and ICOs prompted tumbles in the global cryptocurrency market, and the future of the industry in China remains unclear even now. However, despite the industry\u0027s precarious position, a new set of statistics by Thomson Reuters, reported by DecentralPost, indicates that China filed the largest number of blockchain patents in 2017.\n\nChina Accounts For Nearly Half of All Patents\n\n2017 was a breakout year for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based companies and projects. The industry captivated investors all around the globe, with huge numbers of new offerings in every possible category jockeying for investor funds and interest. Throughout the year, China dominated when it came to patents filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The Asian powerhouse country was responsible for 49% of all patents in the blockchain space in 2017. The U.S. ranked second with 33% of patents filed.\n\nThe People\u0027s Bank of China (PBOC) was first among the Chinese organizations that filed blockchain patents. Three of its branches submitted a total of 68 patent applications related to blockchain.\n\nBlockchain Patents Increased Overall\n\nChina was not the only country to see significant interest in blockchain-related patents. Indeed, blockchain patent applications tripled in 2017 over the previous year. Cryptocurrency-related patent applications rose by 16% for a total of 602 new patents requested in 2017.\n\nThe Chinese government appears to have a sustained and significant interest in the blockchain space. The country\u0027s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced plans to create a standardization committee for the new technology earlier this month. At the same time, the Investment Association of China (IAC) launched a blockchain-focused Global Blockchain Investment and Development Center with the aim of spurring additional research and development in the country. The IAC indicated that it \"will vigorously promote R\u0026D, application, promotion, investment and innovation of blockchains in China, [and] strengthen the integration and international cooperation of blockchain resources,\" according to bitrazzi.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology will disrupt real estate as well.\n\nBlockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and sellers to connect with one another. Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs. This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.\n\n",
    "content": "Given blockchain’s disruption of financial services and subsequent widespread application across industries, it’s hard to find a segment that has not been influenced by the technology. Cryptocurrencies have made a strong impact on payments, remittances, and foreign exchange. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have challenged stock investing, startup loans, and venture capital. Even the food supply chain industry has been upended by blockchain.\n\nReal estate hasn’t escaped blockchain disruption either. Previously, transacting high value assets such as real estate exclusively through digital channels has never been the norm. Real estate transactions are often conducted offline involving face-to-face engagements with various entities. Blockchain, however, opened up ways to change this. The introduction of smart contracts in blockchain platforms now allows assets like real estate to be tokenized and be traded like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.\n\nTrading real estate this way varies. Here are six ways blockchain has changed the real estate game.\n\n1. Platforms and Marketplaces\n\nReal estate technology has traditionally been primarily concerned with listings and with connecting buyers and sellers. However, blockchain introduces new ways to trade real estate and can enable trading platforms and online marketplaces to support real estate transactions more comprehensively. For example, ATLANT has developed a platform that uses blockchain technology to facilitate real estate and rental property transactions. By tokenizing real property, assets can then be traded much like stocks on an exchange and transactions can be done online.\n\nATLANT allows sellers to tokenize assets, essentially handling it like a stock sale, and liquidating that asset through a token sale using the platform. The collected tokens can be exchanged for fiat currency, with buyers owning a percentage stake of the property.\n\n2. No Intermediaries\n\nBrokers, lawyers, and banks have long been part of the real estate ecosystem. However, blockchain may soon usher in a shift in their roles and participation in real estate transactions, according to a report by Deloitte.﻿﻿ New platforms can eventually assume functions such as listings, payments, and legal documentation. Cutting out the intermediaries will result in buyers and sellers getting more out of their money as they save on commissions and fees charged by these intermediaries. This also makes the process much quicker as the back-and-forth between these middlemen gets cut.\n\n3. Liquidity\n\nReal estate has long been considered an illiquid asset since it takes time for sales to conclude. This isn’t the case with cryptocurrencies and tokens since they can, in theory, be readily traded for fiat currencies through exchanges. However, as tokens, real estate can be readily traded. A seller doesn’t have to wait for a buyer who can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property.\n\n4. Fractional Ownership\n\nBy allowing fractional ownership, blockchain also lowers the barriers to real estate investing. Typically, investments would require significant money upfront in order to acquire property. Alternatively, investors with could also pool their money to acquire bigger ticket properties. Through blockchain, investors would simply have to access a trading app to buy and sell even fractions of tokens as they see fit. In addition, fractional ownership would also help them avoid managing the properties themselves such as maintenance and leasing.\n\nUpkeep alone can add up to significant costs and dealing with tenants may be a troublesome effort. This also affects related activities such as lending where property owners often have to put their properties as collateral for loans in order to get quick access to cash. Depending on the terms, property owners may also continue enjoying use of their property.\n\n5. Decentralization\n\nBlockchain commands trust and security as a decentralized technology. Information stored in the blockchain is accessible to all peers on the network, making data transparent and immutable. One only has to go back to the housing bubble crash in 2008 to see how greed and the lack of transparency in the part of institutions can have catastrophic consequences. A decentralized exchange has trust built into the system. Since information can be verifiable to peers, buyers and sellers can have more confidence in conducting transactions. Fraud attempts would also be lessened. Smart contracts are increasingly becoming admissible records with Vermont and Arizona passing such legislation. As such, smart contracts would have more enforceability beyond the technology itself.\n\n6. Costs\n\nThe transparency associated with a decentralized network can also trim down costs associated with real estate transactions. Beyond the savings made by cutting out intermediaries’ professional fees and commissions, there are other costs such as inspections costs, registration fees, loan fees, and taxes associated with real estate. These costs even vary depending on the territory that has jurisdiction. Like intermediaries, these can be reduced or even eliminated from the equation as platforms automate these processes and make them part of the system.\n\nGlobal real estate is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars, but is dominated by the wealthy and large corporations. Through blockchain technology, it is possible that more people will be able to access the market where transactions can be made more transparent, secure, and equitable. Real estate transactions may eventually become truly peer-to-peer activities with blockchain-powered platforms doing most of the work.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Coca-Cola and the U.S. State Department are using blockchain to combat forced labor in their supply chains.\n\n",
    "content": "A private-public initiative spearheaded by the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and the United States Department of State will use blockchain technology to combat forced labor in their supply chains. The announcement came following a report highlighting the extent of the problem across the world, and especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where Coca-Cola sources most of its sugarcane. A working group plans to tackle employee labor agreements and verification using smart contracts.\n\nThe partnership is part of Coca-Cola’s efforts to respond to criticisms that a large portion of its sugar cane supply is the product of forced labor. The company was at the center of a report by KnowTheChain, a partnership founded by Humanity United, a U.S.-based non-profit organization. Findings highlighted in the report demonstrated a serious need for systemic changes to the status quo and raised a variety of questions surrounding the company’s supply chain.\n\nCoke\u0027s efforts to bring transparency are not the first such initiative to recruit support from the private and public sectors. The United Nations also recently announced plans for a project to increase transparency and provide easy identity documents for all people. These programs highlight the increasing uses found for blockchain beyond the business realm. Such initiatives leverage the technology’s advantages as a positive force for social change.\n\nTackling Human Rights On the Supply Chain\n\nThe KTC study, which focused on Coca-Cola and 10 other companies worldwide, studied the food and beverage industry’s supply chains, eventually finding that these corporations do too little in the fight against forced labor. The problem is also pervasive in the region where many of these companies have large stakes. Per the International Labor Organization, almost 25 million people work in forced labor around the globe, with nearly half concentrated in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nIn the aftermath of the study, Coca-Cola committed to a series of 28 studies at the country level that will deal with land rights, child labor and forced labor in broader terms by 2020. The company’s priority will be to increase transparency across its supply chain whilst ensuring workers are both properly rewarded and protected by the law and its own corporate rules.\n\nThe beverage giant has also been exploring projects involving blockchain for some time now, looking for the right model to resolve persistent problems. The lack of transparency in hiring practices in the sector alongside an inability to properly monitor contracts and labor agreements means many times workers have no way to end their agreements or seek help. Similarly, these workers may lose their lands in disputes over a lack of proper documentation and murky bureaucratic processes.\n\nAimed At Better Labor Record-Keeping\n\nThe joint effort by the State Department and Coca-Cola will seek to directly address these problems by employing blockchain and smart contracts to deliver greater transparency and record-keeping regarding laborers and their contracts. The project also includes a collaboration with Blockchain Trust Accelerator – a non-profit that uses blockchain to deliver social impact world-wide – and will be developed by the Bitfury Group using Emercoin’s ledger services.\n\nBy deploying blockchain’s distributed ledger, the venture is working to build a secure registry for employees and contracts. In addition, an essential component of the work surrounds establishing higher verification standards to prevent forced labor and child labor. This is similar to existing technology which employs smart contracts to create more transparent agreements between parties and reduces the possibility of unfair labor practices. Moreover, there are several companies working in the supply chain management sector that are engaging blockchain to increase accountability and record-keeping quality. (See also: What is a Distributed Ledger?)To be sure, while viewed as a positive step, the project is not a panacea. Although blockchain-based systems can offer the benefits of transparency and accountability, they cannot force people to abide by them. Moreover, there are concerns that even if the program takes off, many laborers will not have access to the services. Of the individuals working in this group, many do not have smartphones or easy access to computers where they can take advantage of the future application. The group hopes, however, that a clear trail of evidence will make compliance a more likely outcome. (See also: Banks Claim They\u0027re Building Blockchains. They\u0027re Not.)Blockchain As a Force for Change\n\nCoca-Cola’s initiative is one more in a string of recent private-public partnerships aimed at tackling global problems using blockchain. In a similar announcement earlier this month, the United Nations revealed they are working with crypto wallet company Blockchain to explore a variety of use cases. This includes areas like voting rights and transparency, sustainable development, and resource conservation. ConsenSys, a group representing 22 organizations, is currently developing an incubator for social initiatives that use blockchain in humanitarian aid.\n\nThese ventures highlight the growing influence of blockchain, and a change in perception as the technology sheds its cryptocurrency origins to become a standalone offering. Its many benefits are also a strong fit for social endeavors as they create more transparent and democratic models that remove barriers to access.

    "summary": "The World Bank has called for the creation of a blockchain-based bond.\n\nIn August 2018, the World Bank created the bond-i, the world\u0027s first global bond using distributed ledger technology. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia arranged the blockchain bond issue, which initially raised A$110 million and a subsequent A$50 million during a second tranche offering. Financial institutions are beginning to look to the power of blockchain technology for the management, creation, and oversight of various debt instruments. A benefit of blockchain-based bonds is the ability to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies.\n\nThe World Bank raises on average between $55 billion and $65 billion each year by issuing bonds.\n\n",
    "content": "Some of the most important and influential financial institutions worldwide may be looking to further integrate blockchain technology into their offerings, including the creation of blockchain-based bonds. For an example of how to accomplish this, they might look to one of the world\u0027s largest lenders to developing countries, the World Bank.\n\nIn August 2018, the World Bank launched its bond-i, short for \"blockchain operated new debt instrument.\" The new bond was created through Australia\u0027s Commonwealth Bank (CBA). Below, we\u0027ll discuss how blockchain-based bonds work and take a look at how these bonds could impact the mainstream investment world.\n\nBond-i Details\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the bond-i is the world\u0027s first bond to be \"created, allocated, transferred, and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology.\" The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the arranger for the bond issue, which raised A$110 million. The maturity date for the two-year bond was Aug. 28, 2020. Coupon payments were paid semi-annually in arrears at an annual rate of 2.2%.\n\nThe bond-i was the culmination of research performed by the World Bank\u0027s Blockchain Innovation Lab. Launched in June 2017, the lab\u0027s research is part of the World Bank\u0027s strategy to study the impact of disruptive technologies (such as blockchain) on global economies and harness its potential for development. The CBA Blockchain Centre of Excellence developed and built the bond-i blockchain platform.\n\nIn May 2019, the World Bank and CBA announced they had successfully added to their platform\u0027s capability by enabling secondary bond trading recorded on blockchain. The goal was to assist capital markets in achieving fast, efficient, and secure transactions via distributed ledger technologies. In August 2019, the World Bank reported it had issued a second tranche of its blockchain bond, raising an additional A$50 million.\n\nIt\u0027s important to note that while bond-i is the first bond issued through blockchain, it is not the only debt instrument to do so. The Spanish banking group BBVA signed a €150 million blockchain-based loan in November 2018.\n\nEthereum Blockchain Is Integral\n\nA private Ethereum blockchain is set up to allow for the management of blockchain bonds. This blockchain network also creates bond-i products. According to the World Bank, the platform has been reviewed by Microsoft to ensure that architecture, security, and functionality are solid. The CBA development team partnered with a law firm to plan for the issuance of bonds and to develop the smart contracts which govern bond-i products.\n\nIndependent blockchain developer Matthew Di Ferrante, who has previously worked for the Ethereum Foundation, indicated that the move is a \"good first example\" of how blockchain can be integrated into the bond world. He adds that \"financial instruments like bonds are easily ported to blockchains/smart contracts, but it\u0027s not the be-all and end-all even for mainstream financial institutions. The real usefulness will come when many different institutions and industries are all using compatible blockchains\" (emphasis in original).\n\nImplications of the Project\n\nWhile the bonds issued as part of this project may be fairly standard, the implications of the project are not. First, there is the question of decentralization. For much of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, decentralization is a crucial and central tenet. Necessarily, a private blockchain with the World Bank co-managing is not nearly as decentralized as many blockchain projects are.\n\nFurther, while this bond project harnessed blockchain technology for management, creation, and oversight, it was essentially entirely unrelated to cryptocurrency. Some might see this as a confirmation that mainstream financial institutions are happy to separate out cryptocurrencies from blockchain technology, preferring to only utilize the latter as they ignore the former.\n\nWhile the World Bank\u0027s bondi-i was not the first time that major financial institutions have looked toward blockchain technology in various ways, it does have the potential to influence other institutions which may have previously been hesitant. Undoubtedly, the perceived success or failure of the bond-i program will impact other financial institutions\u0027 decision to explore this space as well.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain operating system uses blockchain as the platform for running a device\u0027s operating system\n\nA blockchain operating system leverage blockchain ledger technology to run computer systems or networks in whole or in part. In order to function as an OS, blockchain protocols must allow for the execution of computer code and commands from users. Initially aimed as OS for mobile phones or other connected smart devices, blockchain operating systems tout a high level of data security and user anonymity.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain Operating System?\n\nA blockchain operating system uses blockchain as a support system that runs in the background of a computer system or platform. For instance, your Android mobile or Windows PC needs a local installation of the respective operating system (OS) on the smartphone’s memory or on the PC’s hard disk, and all transactions and commands are executed locally. A blockchain-based OS captures all commands and transactions from a user’s device where authenticating, executing, and recording them occurs on the blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Operating Systems\n\nBeyond the standard payment processing system of the popular Bitcoin cryptocurrency, blockchain is finding extensive use all across the technology stack. The emerging fad among the technical development on distributed ledger technology is the blockchain operating system.\n\nA blockchain essentially works as a ledger turned transaction processing engine. Whether you need a payment processed, or you need to arm your cryptokitty with the latest gadget on the Ethereum platform, or if you want to track your high-cost wine shipment right from the vineyard to your doorstep on the VeChain blockchain, all such applications of blockchain are based on authenticating, recording, and processing transactions.\n\nAny standard operating system, be it Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or mobile systems like Android or iOS, also executes transactions based on user commands issued through mouse-clicks or screen-taps where all the tasks get completed locally on the device. The same concept is extended to the use of a blockchain for device OS, where its use for working as an operating system is seen as a more efficient OS.\n\nExamples of Blockhain OS Efforts\n\nEarly attempts to build blockchain-based OS first emerged for mobile and smartphone use, and it was a cloud-based virtual system. All the necessary transaction processing occurs on the cloud-hosted blockchain-based data center, with the user only issuing necessary commands through the taps on the device touchscreen.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong-based NYNJA Group Ltd. has a strategic collaboration with Amgoo smartphone makers for its blockchain-based NYNJA virtual operating system (vOS). The two companies will work with telecom operators in Latin America to provide NYNJA vOS users with an initial block of data upon activation. The vOS supports a communication layer offering text, voice, video conferencing, and project management tools, a secure payments layer for commercial transactions, and a multi-currency wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all ERC-20 compatible tokens.\n\nThe OS platform also supports a marketplace for commercial activities—like allocating the skilled ‘gig economy workers to specific job demands from the users, and a market for users to buy and sell goods. The vOS is supported by its native cryptocurrency called NYNJAcoin or NYN.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nAll benefits and advantages of blockchain are expected to be available to blockchain OS users.\n\nWhatever a user does on their Android or iOS mobiles, or Windows or Mac PCs is prone to be captured by the respective apps, ISPs, as well as OS manufacturers who may record all user activities in the OS logs. Blockchain-based OS offers benefits of security and privacy, and the de-regulated, decentralized use of OS.\n\nThe concept is still evolving, and real-world use is limited. However, if it succeeds in offering a smooth and clutter-free working of the device OS, it may not be too far to see more and more devices running on such blockchain OS.\n\n",

    "summary": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that enables users to manage the cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether.\n\nBroadly speaking, a blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and trade their cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet is also the name of a specific wallet service provided by the company Blockchain. This is an E-wallet that allows individuals to store and transfer cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet users can manage their balances of Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto assets. Blockchain Wallet charges dynamic fees, meaning that the transaction fees can be different based on factors such as transaction size. Blockchain Wallet has a number of security features to prevent theft, including by company insiders.\n\n",
    "content": "A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Wallet can also refer to the wallet service provided by Blockchain, a software company founded by Peter Smith and Nicolas Cary. A blockchain wallet allows transfers in cryptocurrencies and the ability to convert them back into a user\u0027s local currency.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Wallet\n\nE-wallets allow individuals to store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. In the case of Blockchain Wallet, users can manage their balances of various cryptocurrencies such as the well-known Bitcoin and Ether as well as stellar, Tether, and Paxos Standard.\n\nCreating an e-wallet with Blockchain Wallet is free, and the account setup process is done online. Individuals must provide an email address and password that will be used to manage the account, and the system will send an automated email requesting that the account be verified.\n\nOnce the wallet is created, the user is provided with a Wallet ID, which is a unique identifier similar to a bank account number. Wallet holders can access their e-wallet by logging into the Blockchain website, or by downloading and accessing a mobile application.\n\nThe Blockchain Wallet interface shows the current wallet balance for crypto-assets and the user’s most recent transactions. Users can also access the price charts and see the value of the funds in the chosen local currency of the user. There is also an educational Did You Know section sharing crypto facts and news.\n\nHow a Blockchain Wallet Works\n\nUsers can send a request to another party for a specific amount of bitcoin or other crypto-assets, and the system generates a unique address that can be sent to a third party or converted into a Quick Response code or QR code for short. A QR code is similar to a barcode, which stores financial information and can be read by a digital device.\n\nA unique address is generated each time the user makes a request. Users can also send crypto-assets when someone provides them with a unique address. The send-and-receive process is similar to sending or receiving funds through PayPal but uses cryptocurrency instead. PayPal is an online payment provider that acts as a go-between for customers and their banks and credit cards by facilitating online transfers through financial institutions.\n\nUsers can also exchange Bitcoin for other crypto-assets and visa-versa, known as swapping. This practice is an easy way to switch out crypto without leaving the security of the Blockchain Wallet. Users are shown a quote indicating how much they will receive based on the current exchange rate, with the rate changing depending on how long the user takes to complete the transaction. Swaps should take a couple of hours while the transactions are added to each currency’s blockchain. However, if it takes longer than six hours, users should contact customer support.\n\nBlockchain Wallet only allows six crypto-assets for swapping: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, Tether, USD Digital, Wrapped-DGLD.\n\nUsers can also buy or sell crypto through the Buy Crypto interface available to Blockchain Wallet. Buy and sell services are not available in all locations. To make a purchase, a user can either transfer funds from a bank, use a credit or debit card, or use the available cash balance. There is a daily limit of $25,000 and a weekly limit of $100,000 as well as a minimum buy order of $5 and a maximum buy order of $25,000.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Fees\n\nHowever, it\u0027s important to note that the Blockchain Wallet uses a process they call dynamic fees, meaning that the fee charged per transaction can be different based on various factors. Both the transaction size and the conditions of the network at the time of the transaction can greatly impact the size of the fee. Only so many transactions can be processed within a block by the high-powered computers called miners. The miners typically process the transactions that have the highest fees first since it\u0027s financially advantageous to them.\n\nBlockchain Wallet offers a priority fee, which could possibly get the transaction processed within an hour. There\u0027s also a regular fee, which is cheaper but the transaction would likely take more than an hour. Fees can also be customized by the customer. However, if the customer sets the fee too low, the transfer or transaction could be delayed or rejected.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Security\n\nWallet security is an important consideration for users, as a compromised account may result in users losing control of their assets. Blockchain Wallet has several levels of security to protect user funds from any possible attacker, including the company itself.\n\nLike other digital services, Blockchain Wallet accounts require passwords for the users\u0027 protection. However, the Blockchain company does not store user passwords, and cannot reset the password if lost. This measure prevents company insiders from being able to steal cryptocurrencies. If a user forgets or loses their password, the account can only be recovered with a mnemonic seed.\n\nA mnemonic seed is a random string of English words that function similarly to a password. If a user loses access to their phone or device, the seed can be used to restore the wallet, including any cryptocurrencies. Like passwords, the Blockchain company does not store users\u0027 mnemonic seeds. These seeds follow an industry standard, meaning the wallets can be recovered even if the company goes out of business.\n\nIn addition to the protections outlined above, there are also several optional security measures that are not required but can help secure user wallets against outside attacks. To reduce the danger of phishing, the Blockchain Wallet allows users to use two-factor authentication or IP whitelists to prevent log-ins from unfamiliar devices. It is also possible to block access through the Tor network, thereby preventing prospective hackers from disguising their IP addresses.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. One of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology provides a platform for creating a highly secure, decentralized, anonymized, yet auditable chain of record, used presently in cryptocurrency systems. This same technology could also be used to record and report votes and prevent many types of voter fraud in elections. Especially after the misinformation surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, the world may be ready for blockchain voting on larger scales.\n\n",
    "content": "As a technology, blockchain is quickly becoming unrivaled. Although the Internet has long been familiar with other peer-to-peer applications for file sharing, music streaming, and more, the idea that these types of networks can provide their own security and resources has only been around since 2008. In the decade since its inception, blockchain was mostly tied to the success of the technology that created it, bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, however, it has quickly become a star on its own. With the rise of the world’s favorite cryptocurrency, awareness of the mysterious and unique technology behind it also grew. Developers who recognized the value of blockchain are now racing to create new use cases for it and put their ideas into production.\n\nMany are finding that blockchain’s primary value lies in its ability to improve old systems. Enterprising observers saw the technology’s potential from the start, as bitcoin offered a more secure and transparent payment processing and banking solution than existing ones. In recent years, the same people have used blockchain to revolutionize industries far and wide, including cloud storage, smart contracts, crowdfunding, and even healthcare. However, one of the biggest problems that blockchain’s decentralized muscle can solve is voter fraud.\n\nBlockchain Serves the Voters\n\nIn its most basic form, blockchain is a digital ledger. The technology draws its power from the peers—or nodes—on its network to verify, process, and record all transactions across the system. This ledger is never stored, but rather exists on the “chain” supported by millions of nodes simultaneously. Thanks to encryption and decentralization, blockchain’s database of transactions is incorruptible, and each record is easily verifiable. The network cannot be taken down or influenced by a single party because it doesn’t exist in one place.\n\nIt’s not only financial transactions that work with blockchain, but any type of data transmission. This kind of system infrastructure is extremely useful for voting because a vote is a small piece of high-value data. Out of necessity, modern voting systems are largely stuck in the last century, and those that want to vote must leave their homes and submit paper ballots to a local authority. Why not bring this process online? Some have tried, but it has proven difficult to put faith in the results due to large gaps in security.\n\nBlockchain can solve the many problems discovered in these early attempts at online voting. A blockchain-based voting application does not concern itself with the security of its Internet connection, because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to affect other nodes. Voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible.\n\nBringing Elections into the 21st Century\n\nThere are already companies working to bring blockchain to the voting populace. One such firm is Horizon State, which has launched a unique solution to answer the question, “If democracy was designed with today’s technology, what would it look like?” The company believes its first product is the answer. The company is currently preparing an ICO, planned for October.\n\nHorizon\u0027s secure digital ballot box represents a cost-effective and smart solution to the problems inherent in today’s voting procedures. Participants will use decision tokens (HST) to cast their votes from a mobile phone or PC, which are then logged into an immutable blockchain and used to reliably verify the outcome of the election. There can be no manipulation, recording errors, or tampering. More than voting, however, this system will be useful simply for making decisions in an environment where resources and authority are shared. It will also encourage participation.\n\nVoter apathy has seen the number of people show up to cast their votes dwindle in recent years, even as it has become more important to do so. By providing an irrefutable and easy way to vote from one’s phone or PC, these numbers would likely rise. Even governments have a reason to change the status quo: a single vote currently costs between $7.00 and $25.00, when all factors are considered. A blockchain product like this costs just $0.50 per vote.\n\nHorizon State co-founder Jamie Skella noted that “Democracy is the opportunity to share in the decision-making processes that relate to the shared matters which affect us. Democracy is about reaching a consensus on how to best use our shared resources to achieve the best outcomes for our partners, children, colleagues, staff, and fellow citizens. Where there are shared resources in any cooperative environment, there remains no question: we need better-shared decision-making tools and processes.”Blockchain-based elections are being trialed in the real world. In November 2018, the Thai Democrat Party, Thailand’s oldest political party, held a primary election to elect its new party leader using ZCoin, marking the first large-scale political election carried out using blockchain technology. The vote was concluded with a total of 127,479 votes that came from all over Thailand.﻿﻿﻿A True Democracy\n\nBlockchain is paving the way for a direct democracy, where people can decide the course of policy themselves, rather than rely on representatives to do it for them. While the rules of a political election may have to be changed to make way for such a transparent system, blockchain is also ideal for informing business decisions, guiding general meetings, polling, censuses, and more.\n\nThe use cases for blockchain voting software are many and diverse. Its ability to engage and manage a constituency is crucial to the future of society, not just to produce a transparent outcome but to encourage all people to participate in their communities. Currently, the technology is still in its infancy, but it matures alongside the young voters it will one day help, and looks to be a key part of our collective future.\n\n",

    "summary": "All hype aside, blockchain technology is really good at one thing: taking out the middlemen. Leaky data brokers\u0027 days may be numbered.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technology has been dragged through the muck in recent months by scammers, charlatans and comedians. A joke cryptocurrency attracted piles of real cash, a kleptocratic regime announced an ICO, and an ice tea company pivoted to bitcoin mining. (For about a minute.) In the wake of all this hype, plunging cryptocurrency prices have hardly helped matters. It\u0027s time for a reminder that, while no panacea, blockchain technology is extremely good at doing one, quite useful thing: removing intermediaries.\n\nTake bitcoin, the original token on the original blockchain, which gave people an unprecedented third option for transferring money. Prior to bitcoin\u0027s invention, one of two things was possible: handing money over in person, or trusting a middleman such as a bank to do it on your behalf. With bitcoin, you can transfer money remotely without a middleman. This is a first in human history.\n\nThe economy harbors plenty of middlemen besides banks, but projects based on bitcoin\u0027s core innovation, the blockchain, have the potential to challenge them as well. Take data brokers. These are mostly obscure, with meaningless, x-heavy names like Acxiom, DataLogix, Experian, Ameridex, and the now-famous Equifax. These firms scrape consumer data – financial transfers, social media activity, browsing history, e-commerce purchases, location data – from public sources, or buy it from digital services. (Here\u0027s everywhere PayPal customers\u0027 data ends up, for example.)The brokers analyze this data to determine everything from hobbies to credit worthiness to addictions to sexual orientation. They sell it on to advertisers, card issuers, prospective employers and whoever else might be interested. In this way, each individual consumer generates a nice stream of rent for an industry that gives them nothing in return. Equifax Inc. (EFX) earned $488.8 million in profit in 2016, $3.36 for each of the 145.5 million victims of the data breach it announced in September.\n\nAccounting for the number of players in the industry and the rapid growth in the amount of data users produce, Datawallet – more on them in a bit – estimates that in the year 2022, roughly $7,600 worth of personal information will be bought and sold per person, a quantity the firm\u0027s founder and CEO Serafin Lion Engel likens to a universal basic income.\n\nIt can only serve that purpose, though, if the money does not go to middlemen, but to the people who actually generate the value. That\u0027s hardly the case today. User data, often called the \"new oil,\" more closely resembles the new guano. These nitrogen-rich seabird feces were the most sought-after fertilizer in the world for most of the 19th century. Like data, guano was procured through extraction, rather than transaction. And as with data, the seabirds that produced the stuff were never compensated.\n\nUsers of digital services are treated a bit like oblivious gulls who happen to excrete an immensely productive resource, rather than owners of an asset they create. Blockchain technology and related cryptographic techniques could change that, giving us control over our personal data and enabling us to sell it to whomever we please.\n\n\"You have the monopoly\"\n\nDatawallet is one of the companies trying to bring this change about. The app has mostly gained media attention as a way to earn $5 or $10 a month selling Facebook likes, Amazon purchases, Uber rides and Airbnb trips. Engel expects early adopters to be college students \"who are in it for beer money.\"But the idea behind Datawallet holds a more fundamental appeal, the ability to control what Engel calls a \"self-sovereign wallet,\" which makes the user the sole owner of their data and the only one with the ability to grant access to it. Engel says, \"you have the monopoly over that data about you.\"Datawallet is just one among a slew of blockchain-based apps aiming to do away with data middlemen wherever they can be found.\n\nMedicalchain is tackling medical records, giving patients full control over some of their most sensitive information and bypassing the healthcare system\u0027s decrepit infrastructure (think fax machines) in the process. Loomia is going after smart textiles, an industry in which other players are eager to harvest and hoard heart rates, geographical movements and even more intimate metrics (think smart mattresses).\n\nMost of these projects are in their very early stages, but if they come to fruition, something unprecedented and rather strange may emerge: empty platforms, places that facilitate commerce in data, but where no one party is doing the facilitating. Henri Pihkala, founder and CEO of Streamr, a blockchain-based platform for live data streams, captures the paradox: \"we make a central place which is decentralized.\"The tech: Keys, hashes, smart contracts\n\nHow does that work? The details vary, but Datawallet\u0027s solution is generally representative of the technology that enables these decentralized platforms.\n\nKeysSay you want to sell some of your personal data – for example, your Facebook activity or Amazon purchases – using Datawallet. You and the purchaser each have a public key and a private key. Public keys are used to encrypt a message, to scramble it so that it looks like gibberish to everyone except the holder of the matching private key, who can use it to decrypt (unscramble) the message.\n\nIn order to exchange your private data securely, you encrypt it with the purchaser\u0027s public key and send the encrypted data to them. They take the data and decrypt it with their private key. If someone in the middle intercepts the data, all they obtain is an unreadable mess.\n\nHashesIn Datawallet\u0027s design, the data exchange itself happens off-chain, since the contents are both too large and too sensitive to broadcast to the central ledger (for Datawallet and most other projects, this ledger is the ethereum blockchain). What does go on the blockchain are hashes of the data. You hash the data you\u0027re selling and post the result to the chain, and the buyer hashes the data they receive and posts that result to the chain. If the hashes match, a payment held in escrow is released. (See also, Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Driven by Different Purposes.)What are hashes and what do they accomplish? They are cryptographic functions that enable quick verification that two sets of data are identical.\n\nThey do this by distilling data down to a manageable chunk. No matter how short or long the text you run through SHA256, the hash function used by bitcoin, you will get 64 characters back. Here\u0027s the hash of the first scene of Hamlet, for example:Now if you have the text of Hamlet, you can instantly check that what you\u0027ve received has not been tampered with – no need to pore over every jot and tittle. Simply hash your text and compare it to the hash of the sender\u0027s ostensibly identical text. (This works just as well for web browser data or Amazon purchase histories.)The process is instant because hash functions are so finicky. Delete the exclamation point in the scene\u0027s first line, and that one change yields an unrecognizably different hash:This sensitivity to tampering makes hashing central to bitcoin, ethereum and their peers. Thousands of identical copies of a blockchain can be efficiently maintained because they\u0027re compared using hashes, rather than through meticulous scans of every block. (See also, How Bitcoin Works.)Hashes are also useful because data cannot be unhashed. No one using any known technology can take 91BBAB0… and wring Shakespeare back out of it. That makes it relatively safe to broadcast a hash of sensitive information to the blockchain, as Datawallet does.\n\nBlockchain and smart contractsEven though the data exchange itself does not happen on-chain, the ledger is crucial to decentralized data transfer. Blockchains are immutable public records that remove all doubt about what was traded, at what price, and when. The hashes broadcast to the blockchain either match or they don\u0027t, so buyers can\u0027t claim they didn\u0027t receive data that in fact they did. Nor does anybody need to wonder whether a hacker or spy tampered with the data en route.\n\nWithout the need for someone to mediate the exchange, brokers lose their raison d\u0027être. They are replaced by a large number of (ideally) dispersed, competing and mutually distrustful \"miners\" who post exchanges to the ledger. (See also, How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)Miners also obviate the need for a bank: blockchain technology\u0027s main application has always been as a distributed money transfer platform. Finally, ethereum offers the ability to enforce complex contracts via this same distributed network of miners. You may have paused at the reference to a \"payment held in escrow\" above. Who\u0027s holding the money while it straddles buyer and seller?No one, it turns out. Ethereum took bitcoin\u0027s decentralized money and made it programmable via smart contracts: self-executing bits of code that live on the blockchain. If all the hashes match and all other pre-agreed conditions are met, the money automatically moves from the buyer\u0027s account to the seller\u0027s. No need for a trusted custodian in the middle.\n\nBlockchain has problems aplenty\n\nAs promising as this technology sounds, not all the kinks have been worked out. Some may never be. Start with scalability.\n\nExpensive and slowBlockchains are fat, lumbering beasts. Distributed consensus is slow and costly compared to the centralized networks that are currently in operation, so how can blockchain technology compete in a user data market that – for all its shadiness – at least works at scale?Datawallet sidesteps the problem by transferring data off-chain. On-chain transfers of data troves that might include videos and other large files \"would immediately crash the ethereum blockchain,\" says Engel. And in any case, no one would want that kind of data broadcast to a public ledger.\n\nMedicalchain leaves health records where they are, on regulatory-compliant servers in the patient\u0027s home jurisdiction. It simply provides a platform for patients to grant doctors access to their records. (See also, Blockchain Technology Could Revolutionize Health Care.)Some projects are trying to scale by tweaking the way distributed networks are structured. Streamr combines a \"reputation mechanism\" called karma with its blockchain-based token, DATAcoin, to divvy up the work. \"We need to assign asymmetric responsibilities to different nodes,\" says Pihkala, \"otherwise we end up with a situation that is typical with current-day blockchains, which is all the data goes to all the nodes, leading to no scalability.\" The nodes put down a DATAcoin stake, which they lose if they break the rules. Karma, meanwhile, assigns greater responsibility to the most reliable nodes, increasing efficiency without sacrificing too much in the way of decentralization.\n\nKochava is taking similar ideas and applying them to a blockchain it is building in-house to reduce opacity and fraud in digital advertising. XCHNG, as the platform is called, uses a reputation mechanism and a brutal form of pruning – in which most nodes only hold onto a day\u0027s worth of ledger history – to process the huge volume of transactions digital ad delivery demands. Kochava founder and CEO Charles Manning believes the platform could deliver millions of transactions per second. Ethereum can manage around 15 or so, bitcoin far fewer. (See also, What\u0027s the Bitcoin Scalability Debate?)Where do you store it?Every blockchain application faces problems with storage. Monetary transactions and smart contracts might be utterly decentralized, but the data itself either resides in centralized servers, à la Medicalchain (this is largely for regulatory reasons, to be fair), or on users\u0027 own storage-constrained devices, à la Datawallet.\n\nA number of projects are trying to enable decentralized storage, including IPFS, BigchainDB and Storj. Engel, Pihkala, and Janett Liriano, the CEO of Loomia, each mention plans to integrate their platforms with one or the other of these companies.\n\nYou still give up your dataAt some point, the quest to establish ownership over your personal data hits a wall. You can encrypt it. You can transfer it directly, shunning intermediaries and keeping it encrypted en route. You can ensure that the buyer pays the agreed amount upon receipt.\n\nBut no technological legerdemain can overcome the fact that once the buyer has your data, as Guy Zyskind (co-founder and CEO of Enigma) puts it, \"You\u0027re done. They can take your data, they can copy it, they can go off-chain and then that\u0027s it.\" Rogue employees, incompetent defenses against hacking, reselling – the unpleasant possibilities abound.\n\nYet rather incredibly, Zyskind says you can make your data available to use without actually revealing it. Through a technique called secure multiparty computation, his company is building a platform that enables data not only to be stored in an encrypted, distributed form, but to be computed over while still in that encrypted, distributed form.\n\nWith an IPFS, a Storj or a BigchainDB, it\u0027s possible to keep your data secure and to decentralize it across multiple devices. But if you want to do anything with that data – run it through an algorithm or edit it – you have to decrypt and re-centralize it. In order for a credit rating agency to calculate your creditworthiness, say, they need full access and visibility.\n\n",

    "summary": "The emergence of cryptocurrencies has spawned new investment potential. Some of these might be odd, but where there is value, there is opportunity.\n\nMany established tech companies are investing heavily in blockchain and distributed ledger technology applications. Cryptocurrencies are part of blockchain technology designed for transferring value; investors are also using them to store value, hedge other investments, and hold them for growth. Non-fungible tokens are part of the emerging metaverse design as ownership of digital assets becomes popular. Digital securities use blockchain to create traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Web 3 is a concept of internet privacy and ownership being developed using blockchain technology.\n\nParamount among the benefits of DLT is its ability to reduce the costs of maintaining, securing, and verifying databases on a global scale.\n\nNew blockchain uses are constantly emerging as more companies research ways to incorporate it into their industries and internal procedures.\n\nDigital securities trading may not be regulated or available where you live, so ensure you check with your country\u0027s authorities before attempting it.\n\n",
    "content": "Distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain have made their way into business, finance, and many other industries. Their introduction to the mainstream following the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies has created new investment vehicles, opportunities, and new sectors. Additionally, new business models using these advancements are emerging that improve workflows, data security, e-commerce, government processes, and much more.\n\nA distributed ledger is a network of stored files in which every transaction is recorded. Blockchain was developed from the distributed ledger concept, but it enhances public use and security. Programs are used to confirm, validate, and archive information, and they can be accessed in near real-time by all participants.\n\nIn general, there are four broad areas for you to consider investing in: cryptocurrency itself, investment instruments linked to or holding cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens, and businesses developing and implementing new products that use blockchain or distributed ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology is similar to distributed ledger technology (DLT) but is specific to cryptocurrency and the ecosystems that have evolved from it. It uses encryption and verification methods to restrict access to append-only, where new data can be entered, but existing data can not be changed.\n\nBlockchain use cases have exploded, with the technology making its way into everything from tokenizing pixel art to fantasy football leagues to digital worlds where you can buy virtual real estate.\n\nUnderstanding Distributed Ledger Technology\n\nDLT is used across enterprises to synchronize and share data in a ledger while verifying the accuracy of inputs and outputs. The span of industries using DLT continues to grow, encompassing supply chains, accounting, financial services, warehousing, shipping, and more.\n\nThe good news is that opportunities for investing in blockchain and DLT are abundant, giving you a chance to leverage the potential offered. How you choose to invest in blockchain technology will largely depend on the amount of risk you\u0027re willing to incur and what interests you.\n\nCompanies Developing Blockchain Uses\n\nYou can invest in several companies that are researching and developing blockchain and DLT products and services. Many well-known companies are developing blockchains for business, and many more are creating them for in-house use. There are several markets you can choose from:Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the concept of removing financial institutions from their role as third parties in transactions. The idea is to allow people to take control of their finances with digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, and other financial services.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency is part of DeFi, it is only the tip of the iceberg. DeFi is the all-inclusive term for all things financial that are not part of any traditional, centralized method of controlling money. Cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency exchanges, lenders, borrowers, and even insurance are part of this growing sector.\n\nFinancial technology (Fintech) is the development and use of technology to improve existing financial services. The developments in blockchain technology are revolutionizing traditional services like lending, money transfers, and banking. Paypal is one of the most well-known examples of a fintech company—there are many more you can choose from to diversify your portfolio.\n\nThe metaverse is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp that is expected to use blockchain. The metaverse is an emerging digital and ever-present world where virtual reality, augmented reality, and reality meet. The concept is to develop an immersive digital experience where a person can learn, work, play, and socialize.\n\nSocial media platforms, game developers, and technology companies are developing the hardware and software needed for this digital life experience. Meta (formerly Facebook), Advanced Microdevices (AMD), Nvidia, Amazon, and Epic Games are examples of companies that have expressed interest in metaverse products and services. Blockchain will play a large part in the metaverse as it develops.\n\nWeb 3 companies are developing solutions that are reportedly set to change how the Internet works in the background. Blockchain technology is being used to create an infrastructure designed to restore privacy, ownership, and control to the masses.\n\nHere are some of the emerging theories on how Web 3 will benefit everyone using blockchain technology:You can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies by setting up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange. Price movements create opportunities for profits through day trading or buying and selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese exchanges are also businesses—Coinbase (COIN) is a publicly traded company with stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange that can expose you to blockchain without requiring you to invest directly in cryptocurrency.\n\nDigital Securities\n\nBlockchain has enabled the decentralization and tokenization of nearly anything that has value. For example, a company that wants to raise money can create digital investment instruments using a blockchain, similar to how non-fungible tokens are created. Tokenization, in this respect, is the transfer of ownership or interest to a token, which is the digital representation of that ownership linked to the blockchain.\n\nDigital securities use smart contracts—programs that execute exchanges or trades as soon as both parties agree to it. This creates a safety net for traders and investors who want to buy or sell securities directly with another party rather than through a transaction facilitator like a broker.\n\nThe digital securities market continues to evolve, but you can find them emerging in sectors such as:The main benefit of digital securities is that they can be fractionalized to a much greater degree than is practical with traditional securities. In addition, this fractionalization offers exposure to markets that you may not have previously been able to access due to the amount of capital needed to gain entry.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are tokenized. They existed before 2021, but media attention that year popularized them in the mainstream after the digital artist Beeple sold a collage of non-fungible tokens for $69 million. An NFT can be any digital asset—clothing, art, music, movies, video games, or anything else that can be tokenized.\n\nEmerging and Future Developments\n\nFollowing Bitcoin\u0027s release, the products that have emerged using blockchains have been at the center of most people\u0027s interest. There isn\u0027t much left to tokenize that hasn\u0027t already been attempted, and new cryptocurrencies do not gain much attention because they are just more of what is already available. Decentralized applications and decentralized financial services are more common.\n\nBlockchain developers continue to work on scaling issues, transaction throughput, centralization concerns, and more—with new blockchains emerging all the time. But similar to the cryptocurrencies created using blockchains, more blockchains are just more of the same.\n\nWeb 3 development is underway, but whether it will gain traction is unclear. There is still a long road ahead and developers face many challenges—primarily convincing those who have monetized the web\u0027s infrastructure to release their interests in favor of allowing the dream of decentralization to be realized.\n\nBlockchain development, as the average person understands it (the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, technology behind Web 3) is expected to continue growing, but it\u0027s possible that it will slow in favor of newer technology.\n\nIf the Blockchain Boom Stalls, What\u0027s Next?\n\nBlockchain brought about the realization that data and information can be immutable and accurate. Next came developments in artificial intelligence, which progressed as rapidly as blockchain did after Bitcoin was popularized.\n\nLatest developments point to a merger of three technologies—immutable and accurate data, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence. The theory is that, eventually, this merger will bring authenticity to data, augment businesses with vast amounts of internal and external data, automate many costly processes, and reduce the time needed in decision-making by providing accurate and data-backed recommendations.\n\nFor businesses, this translates into reduced costs and streamlined operations. For investors, it means companies that invest in incorporating blockchain and AI solutions are likely to be more accurate in reporting, more profitable, and more trustworthy.\n\nTo remain competitive, businesses are going to need blockchains backing them because they create trust and can automate many processes. Artificial intelligence can analyze vast amounts of data and facilitate decision-making or even initiate smart contract execution, speeding up processes tremendously.\n\nSmall businesses won\u0027t be able to keep up, so they will need to determine if they could benefit from blockchain+AI-as-a-service solutions, another emerging service.\n\nQuite possibly, the next iteration of blockchain development will be an industry that combines all blockchain and AI developments. This industry is expected by some to grow exponentially in the near future.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrency and is where most development and research are focused. It is becoming more popular as more use cases are conceived and people learn more about it.\n\n",

    "summary": "Blockchain is the technology that undergirds the cryptocurrency world, but itspotential uses extend much farther.\n\nBlockchain technology has far-reaching applications across many industries. Blockchain is already used to facilitate identity management, smart contracts, supply chain analysis, and much more. The full potential of blockchain technology likely remains to be discovered.\n\n",
    "content": "Cryptocurrencies of all types make use of distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. Blockchains act as decentralized systems for recording and documenting transactions that take place involving a particular digital currency. Put simply, blockchain is a transaction ledger that maintains identical copies across each member computer within a network. The fact that the ledger is distributed across each part of the network helps to facilitate the security of the blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grew intensely popular among the general financial and investment worlds in late 2017 and early 2018, they have since become more of a niche area for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, blockchain technology remains a quickly-growing area of growth for companies across a host of industries. It is possible that blockchain technology will ultimately be seen as the most important innovation to come out of the cryptocurrency boom. Below, we\u0027ll take a closer look at blockchain and see why this technology could be valuable to businesses of all kinds.\n\nBasics of Blockchain\n\nDepending upon the blockchain, parties may be able to view previous ledger entries and record new entries, although most blockchain networks have complex rules for the addition of new groups of records, \"blocks,\" to the chain of previous records. The blocks and the contents within them are protected by powerful cryptography, which insures that previous transactions within the network cannot be either forged or destroyed. In this way, blockchain technology allows a digital currency to maintain a trusted transaction network without relying on a central authority. It is for this reason that digital currencies are thought of as \"decentralized.\"While blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating the rise of digital currencies over the past several years, there are also many other non-cryptocurrency uses for this technology. Indeed, some blockchain proponents believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact, and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered. As such, it\u0027s likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it\u0027s being utilized in any number of other applications.\n\nCross-Border Payments\n\nTraditionally, the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow, and especially for payments taking place across international borders. One reason for this is that, when multiple currencies are involved, the transfer process typically requires the participation of multiple banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can actually collect his or her money. There are existing services to help facilitate this process in a faster way, but these tend to by quite expensive.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross-border payments methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain may allow for costs just a fraction of that, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds. There are hurdles to be passed, including regulation of cryptocurrencies in different parts of the world and security concerns. Nonetheless, this is one of the most promising and talked about areas of blockchain technology application.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are often seen as a highly powerful application of blockchain technology. These contracts are actually computer programs that can oversee all aspects of an agreement, from facilitation to execution. When conditions are met, smart contracts can be entirely self-executing and self-enforcing. For proponents of smart contracts, these tools provide a more secure, more automated alternative to traditional contract law, as well as an application that is faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n\nThe potential applications of smart contract technology are essentially limitless and could extend to almost any field of business in which contract law would normally apply. Of course, while highly touted, smart contracts are not a magical substitute for old-fashioned diligence. In fact, the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a cautionary tale and a warning to investors to not assume that smart contracts are any better than the information and organization that a user puts into them. Nonetheless, smart contracts remain one of the most exciting ways that blockchain technology has already extended beyond the cryptocurrency space and into the broader business world.\n\nIdentity Management\n\nOne of the most problematic results of the internet age has been identity security. As diligent as many individuals and organizations are in maintaining their online identities and securing private information, there are always nefarious actors looking to steal and profit off of these digital items. Blockchain technology has already demonstrated the potential for transforming the way that online identity management takes place.\n\nBlockchain offers a tremendous level of security, thanks to independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network. In digital currency cases, this verification is used to approve transaction blocks before they are added to the chain. This mechanism could just as easily be applied to other types of verification procedures, including identity verification and many other applications as well.\n\nThe applications for blockchain and identity management are wide-ranging. For instance, blockchain could potentially be used to aid in maintaining voter information and ensuring proper functioning of the electoral process. Blockchain could be used to securely and efficiently transfer user data across platforms and systems. The technology could also be used to maintain and protect records of real estate ownership, titles, and more.\n\nSupply Chain Uses\n\nFor many businesses across various industries, a key to success is a well-functioning, efficient supply chain. Blockchain technology has already been used in multiple industries as a means of keeping tabs on supply chains and ensuring their efficiency. This could eliminate human work and the potential for error from a complex and crucial process.\n\nAt this point, blockchain is a technology with an exceptionally broad set of potential uses. Although blockchain is most famous for its connections to the blossoming cryptocurrency world, several other applications have already been explored. Perhaps even more exciting, though, is that new ways of utilizing blockchain emerge every day. As such, whether you are directly involved in the digital currency space or not, it\u0027s essential to develop an understanding of blockchain and how it may be used to transform the business and investment worlds.

It allows customers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host, and operate their own blockchain apps and related functions on the blockchain. At the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure agile and operational.\n\nAs a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting blockchain adoption across businesses.\n\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:Consumers and businesses are increasingly willing to adapt to blockchain technology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead involved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure often act as a barrier.\n\nBaaS offers an external service provider to set up all the necessary blockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. Once created, the provider continues to handle the complex back-end operations for the client.\n\nThe BaaS operator typically offers support activities, such as bandwidth management, suitable allocation of resources, hosting requirements, and data security features. The BaaS operator frees the client to focus on the core job: the functionality of the blockchain.\n\nExample of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBelow is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service Hyperledger Cello, a BaaS-like blockchain module toolkit and utility system under the Hyperledger project.\n\nIn fact, a BaaS’ provider\u0027s role is similar to that of a web hosting provider. The website creators create and run all the website content on their own personal computers. They may hire support staff or sign up with an external hosting provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party companies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.\n\nBaaS may be the catalyst that leads to a wider and deeper penetration of blockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead of creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can now simply outsource the technically complex work and focus on its core activities.\n\n",

It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, and includes member organizations that are leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and technology. Several sub-projects exist, including Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Composer, and Cello. Hyperledger varies from Bitcoin as it is not a cryptocurrency but instead used to develop frameworks and tools. Hyperledger uses a consensus layer, smart contract layer, communication layer, and API.\n\nThe Linux Foundation has launched over 70 open sourced organizations with Hyperledger being among the fastest growing.\n\nHyperledger was founded in 2016 with 30 founding corporate members.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Hyperledger?\n\nHyperledger is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open-source blockchains and related applications for use across various industries. Hyperledger\u0027s projects include a variety of enterprise-ready permissioned blockchain platforms, where network participants are known to one another and therefore have an intrinsic interest in participating in the consensus-making process.\n\nUsing the available components under the Hyperledger umbrella, a business can apply various modular blockchain solutions and services to significantly improve the performance of their operations and the efficiency of their business processes.\n\nUnderstanding Hyperledger\n\nThe Hyperledger project was created in December 2015 by the San Francisco, California–based Linux Foundation. It started with 30 member firms and has grown to about 140 member companies today.\n\nHyperledger was set up with the aim of accelerating industry-wide collaboration for developing high-performance and reliable blockchain and distributed ledger-based technology framework that could be used across the various industry sectors to enhance the efficiency, performance, and transactions of the various business processes.\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration that includes leading businesses from the fields of finance, banking, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, manufacturing and production, and technology. They include big names like Bosch, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Deloitte, Hitachi, American Express, JP Morgan, and Visa, in addition to a host of blockchain-based startups like ConsenSys.\n\nHyperledger\u0027s Organizational Structure\n\nEssentially, Hyperledger is not an organization, a cryptocurrency network, or a blockchain system. It does not support a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but it works by providing the necessary infrastructure and standards for developing various blockchain-based systems and applications for industrial use. Think of Hyperledger as a hub, where various individual blockchain-based projects and tools that adhere to its defined design philosophy operate under its umbrella.\n\nThe various projects include the following:All such projects under the Hyperledger umbrella follow the design methodology that supports a modular and extensible approach, interoperability, and security features. The projects remain agnostic to a particular token or cryptocurrency, though a user can create one as required.\n\nHyperledger Technology Layers\n\nIn terms of the architecture, Hyperledger uses the following key business components:Hyperledger vs. Bitcoin\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Hyperledger is vastly different from Bitcoin in that it is not a cryptocurrency. The fundamental purpose and nature of the technology is to develop enterprise-grade blockchain frameworks and tools. While Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, Hyperledger is more geared towards facilitating business processes.\n\nHyperledger frameworks are often private, permissioned blockchains meaning permission to the network is limited to a small number of trusted users. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a public blockchain meaning anyone can participate in the network. Each uses a different form of consensus mechanism as well, as Bitcoin transactions are substantiated using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism while Hyperledger supports Byzantine fault tolerance or other algorithms.\n\nAs hinted to in the previous paragraph, Bitcoin is decentralized. This means no single entity owns it, and the system relies on the collection of the network\u0027s participants. Alternatively, Hyperledger is governed by the Linux Foundation.\n\nLast, Bitcoin is not known for its smart contracts. It\u0027s primary use is to store value, not support complex programmability to facilitate agreements. Alternatively, Hyperledger offers greater smart contract capabilities. This allows businesses to engage in complex agreements relying heavily on logic to distribute assets on a blockchain network.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Linux Foundation is home to the Hyperledger open-source collaborative project which aims to provide business-grade blockchain frameworks and technologies. Businesses may build private, permissioned blockchain networks for a variety of use cases. Hyperledger uses include supply chain management and smart contracts, and Hyperledger is known for its modular and adaptable solutions.\n\n",

    "summary": "The FAANGs are expected to dominate stock market. How are they doing on the blockchain front?\n\n",
    "content": "For investors, blockchain and FAANG are two magic words that can move markets. Mere association of a stock with those two words can make a stock seem more attractive. (See also: Riot Stock Rallies As Blockchain Tech Goes Mainstream.)Investor enthusiasm for blockchain and FAANG is due to their future bullish prospects. Even as FAANG dominates the internet ecosystem, blockchain is set to reinvent the internet and its associated services. Here is a brief primer on how each of the FAANG companies is preparing for the blockchain future.\n\nFacebook Inc. (FB)\n\nFacebook recently announced a high-profile reorganization, moving prominent executives from successful product lines, and placing them into positions of authority within a newly formed blockchain group. David Marcus, who previously headed the company’s successful Messenger services, said the intent of his “small group” was to “explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.” (See also: Facebook\u0027s Bad News. Good News For Blockchain?)The threat to Facebook stems from an inversion of its current business model, where it makes money by selling user data to advertisers. A blockchain world envisages users who have personal control of their data and choose to share it only with parties that they trust. It is still a while before that future comes to pass. According to Spencer Bogart, a venture capitalist at Blockchain Capital, blockchain is not “an existential threat to Facebook today”. But it might become one in the future. “That’s why they [Facebook] want to be smart and stay engaged,” he said.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL)\n\nAccording to reports, Alphabet Inc.\u0027s subsidiary Google plans to use blockchain for securing customer data on its cloud services. The idea is to have a white label version for companies to use on their servers. Google has also invested in blockchain startups through its venture investing arm Google Ventures (GV). The companies in GV’s portfolio comprise a diverse palette. For example, crypto wallet provider LedgerX is one of their investments as is bank transfer company Ripple. As with Facebook, it is still too early to quantify the impact of these investments on Google’s bottom line in the near term.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN)\n\nAmazon competitor Walmart Inc. (WMT) made news last year when it announced a supply chain implementation of blockchain last year to enable customers to determine provenance of its consumer goods. It would seem that Amazon has taken a different route. The Seattle-based company launched AWS Blockchain Templates in its cloud service recently to deploy frameworks for ethereum and Hyperledger on its cloud platform recently. The offering is part of its plan to offer Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Competitors to Amazon in this arena include International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL). (See also: All About Amazon\u0027s New Blockchain.)Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nThe iPhone maker has been characteristically silent regarding its blockchain moves. But Coindesk discovered a patent filed by Apple last December that makes use of blockchain technology to create timestamps. In its patent application, the company said that blockchain technology can be used to build resilience in a distributed system of elements, such as a SIM or MicroSD card. The timestamps are part of a “multi-check architecture” system proposed by Apple. Timestamps will be verified by another system before they are added to the main chain. (See also: Is Apple Planning to Use Blockchain?)Netflix Inc. (NFLX)\n\nOf all the companies within the FAANG group, Netflix is, perhaps, most threatened by blockchain. The video-streaming company has not made any announcements regarding investments in blockchain, but the drumrolls for its demise due to blockchain have already begun. A popular post by Rizwan Virk earlier this year outlined a scenario where a decentralized platform using blockchain technology could get rid of the centralized architecture and traditional gatekeepers of the content business. While it has displaced cable and disrupted linear television viewing habits, Netflix is still the gatekeeper to content on its platform. As such, content makers still need its stamp of approval before their content can be viewed. In the decentralized world, content makers and technology entrepreneurs will be able to make and stream their own content on a subject of their own choosing. The token model could also upend existing business models by making it possible to purchase individual shows with tokens on an entertainment network.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "title": "Gas (Ethereum): How Gas Fees Work on the Ethereum Blockchain\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Gas is the payment required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network. Gas prices are based on supply and demand for the network\u0027s validation requests. Transaction prices are based on the gas limit and gas price. Transaction prices are denoted in tiny fractions of ether called gwei or ETH.\n\nA transaction fee is similar to the fee you pay for a money wire transfer. You\u0027re paying the service provider for using their network.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is Gas (Ethereum)?\n\nGas is the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Fees are priced in tiny fractions of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH)—denominations called gwei (10-9 ETH). Gas is used to pay validators for the resources needed to conduct transactions.\n\nThe exact price of the gas is determined by supply, demand, and network capacity at the time of the transaction.\n\nUnderstanding Gas in Ethereum\n\nThe concept of incentives for work paid in fees (gas) was introduced to compensate miners for their work on maintaining and securing the blockchain—in addition to receiving block rewards.\n\nAfter the proof-of-stake algorithm was rolled out in September 2022, a portion of the gas fee became the reward for staking ETH and participating in validation—the more a user has staked, the more they can earn.\n\nEthereum validators, who perform the essential tasks of verifying and processing transactions on the network, are awarded this fee in return for staking their ether and verifying blocks.\n\nGas fees rise and fall with supply and demand for transactions—if the network is congested, gas prices might be high. On the other hand, they could be low if there is not much traffic.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Gas Fees?\n\nOriginally, gas fees were a product of a gas limit and the gas price per unit. In August 2021, Ethereum changed its calculations for gas fees to use a base fee (a set fee for the transaction set by the network), units of gas required, and a priority fee. The priority fee is a tip to the validator that chooses a transaction—the more you tip, the higher the chances are that your transaction will be processed faster.\n\nGas fees are calculated using this formula:So, imagine you wanted to pay a friend 2 ETH, and you think it will require two units of gas. The base fee is 11 gwei, and you provide a tip of 3 gwei. Your gas fee would be:This equals 0.000000028 ETH. It\u0027s added to your transfer total, which is now 2.000000028 ETH.\n\nGas and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nEthereum, as a platform and system, is designed to be used by others to create more use cases for blockchain and cryptocurrency. For this reason, it is commonly called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, because applications can be created that run on it. The EVM is essentially a large virtual computer, like an application in the cloud, that runs other blockchain-based applications within it.\n\nMany decentralized applications, cryptocurrencies, and tokens have been created using the EVM. Because the Ethereum blockchain is part of the EVM, the cryptocurrencies built on that blockchain require gas fees. For example, a popular token built on Ethereum\u0027s blockchain is DAI. Because it uses the Ethereum blockchain, users need to pay gas fees in gwei to conduct transactions on the chain.\n\nConcerns About Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nAn ongoing concern for any cryptocurrency that requires transaction fees is the price users pay for the transactions. Before 2020, gas fees on Ethereum were very low, measured in a few cents with occasional spikes. After January 2020, gas fees began climbing as the network attracted new users, reaching more than $20 (sometimes much higher) for long periods.\n\nAfter The Merge—the merge of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum main chain when proof-of-stake was implemented—fees began to range from a few dollars to as high as $30. Because fees are generally reflective of network traffic, they can get very high sometimes.\n\nThere are a few ways you can avoid high fees. First, you can choose times when the network is not so busy, a challenging endeavor but not impossible. EtherScan provides a gas tracker that shows the day\u0027s high, low, and average gas fees, so you can try to time your necessary transactions using its tracker or another like it. The website also provides a Chrome extension you can install to the browser that lets you see gas prices in real time.\n\nSecond, you can use Layer 2 solutions or dApps for your transactions. Taking your activity off the main chain is one of the best ways to keep your fees low.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGas fees are used on the Ethereum blockchain and network to incentivize users to stake their ETH. Staking works to secure the blockchain because it discourages dishonest behavior. For staking their ETH, owners are given small payments as a reward for helping to secure the blockchain and help it function.\n\nFees are determined by the amount of network traffic, the supply of validators, and the demand for transaction verification. The higher the demand and traffic, the higher the fees. When traffic and demand are lower, fees become lower.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Here’s what a decentralized, blockchain-based internet promises, and where it may face issues.\n\nTraditional Internet infrastructure relies on centralized services, which can sometimes compromise user data and privacy. A number of new projects are trying to establish a decentralized, blockchain-based Internet alternative that replaces centralized intermediaries with peer-to-peer service providers. These projects face several hurdles, such as attracting enough users and service providers to make the network competitive with traditional services.\n\n",
    "content": "With the Internet becoming a modern-day necessity, there\u0027s a growing push to free it from the control of regulatory authorities and monopolistic tech giants. Many internet users are becoming wary of the corporations that can track or sell their most sensitive private data.\n\nThese challenges have opened the doors for a new concept—a decentralized version of the Internet, based on open-source blockchain networks. Several projects are seeking to replace key elements of online infrastructure with distributed, peer-to-peer systems, that do not rely on a single intermediary or point of failure. This article looks at some of the potential offerings and the hurdles they are likely to face.\n\nProblems with the Centralized Internet\n\nThe Internet is constantly under surveillance, and user data is regularly tracked and collated by corporations, application developers, and governments. A blockchain-based alternative can address this problem by replacing Internet giants with a decentralized, peer-to-peer network of providers.\n\nIn such an alternative, individual internet users would own and operate the infrastructure used for storage and computing. This would take away control from governmental or corporate bodies.\n\nThis form of the Internet may also ensure improved data security. On existing Internet platforms, user data and applications are typically hosted on central servers, allowing companies to create detailed profiles of their users. This data has been used to manipulate populations and election results, for example, during Facebook\u0027s Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nDecentralized Internet Projects\n\nThere are several projects seeking to replace key Internet services with blockchain-based alternatives. For example, Filecoin is seeking to replace centralized cloud storage providers with a decentralized file storage network, allowing users to rent out their unused hard drive space in exchange for cryptocurrency. The files are encrypted, thereby protecting data while allowing users to rent external storage.\n\nAnother startup, called Stack, is seeking to create a new Bitcoin layer for the traditional Internet that can facilitate decentralized applications and smart contracts. Instead of exchanging text, images, and files through a centralized intermediary, users would be able to share data through locally-run apps and retain control over their data. \"Through their platform design,\" according to a profile of the business in CoinDesk, \"applications developers can\u0027t access user data, users can choose who stores their data, and permission rights to read or write to the data are decided by the user.\"Other startups, such as the internet provider Andrena, are seeking to replace centralized routing networks with peer-to-peer mesh networks. Such a decentralized Internet could also come with significant cost advantages, although this is subject to market forces. Instead of relying on traditional Internet Service Providers, anyone with an Internet connection would be able to provide basic cloud services.\n\nIssues with Blockchain Internet\n\nThough the concept of a blockchain-based Internet may seem feasible, there are several obvious challenges. As with other blockchain projects, one of the biggest hurdles will be attracting a critical mass of users so that the platform can benefit from network effects.\n\nSecond, misuse due to anonymity is a major issue in the blockchain world, which includes using cryptocurrencies for unlawful purposes like selling illegal drugs or weapons. Given that data privacy is a major goal of the decentralized Internet, it is unclear how—or if—such a system would prevent users from engaging in illegal activity.\n\nFinally, blockchain networks rely on network participants to run the software that keeps the system running. If the monetary rewards for participation are not attractive enough to incentivize these contributions, participants may stop contributing their computational resources. A fine balance will be needed to make the decentralized blockchain-based Internet viable.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile the concept of a decentralized blockchain-based Internet is gaining traction, a realistic implementation would require a pragmatic and balanced approach within the whole ecosystem. Even from the most optimistic perspective, there are many hurdles to be solved before such a system could be accessible to the majority of Internet users. The concept is still evolving, and it may have a long and uncertain road to success.\n\n",

    "title": "Why Is Walmart Filing Blockchain Patents?\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Walmart has filed for two more blockchain-related patents for its supply chain system. Why?\n\n",
    "content": "Walmart Inc. (WMT) is making another blockchain push.\n\nThe Arkansas-based retail behemoth, which has already reportedly filed blockchain-related patents, has filed for two more. The first patent is for a vendor payment system that automates package tracking and payment processing for shipments. It will be used to fulfill customer orders that require same day delivery. The patent provides an example for its application in an order that has multiple items which require “more discrimination”, such as fresh produce and vegetables. “The vendor payment sharing system and method in accordance with some embodiments permits a user to make one payment that is then encrypted and shared with multiple vendors that worked together to fulfill an order by a customer,” the patent’s authors write. The second patent, which is related to the first, is for a courier shopping system that works in conjunction with a customer relationship module to process orders and ship orders to customers.\n\nThe latest set of reported patents follows a high-profile project announced by the company last year in partnership with IBM (IBM) to ensure food safety. That project used blockchain to source food back to its source. Walmart has formed a coalition of companies to pursue the effort across the food safety industry. Another patent filed by the company envisages a smart package with encoded information relating to its contents and delivery. The package could also be used with drones.\n\nWhy Is Walmart Interested In Blockchain?\n\nAs e-commerce accounts for a greater share of the overall retail pie, blockchain could help Walmart keep pace with its rivals. For example, the company had a three-to-four day delivery window for its suppliers. But Amazon (AMZN) upped the game by reducing delivery times significantly and offering same-day delivery in select markets. With its common ledger and shared copies of data, blockchain could significantly reduce the time and effort required to process orders. Within the context of food safety, blockchain’s timestamp features help establish provenance and freshness quotient of products at Walmart. The new measures are important if Walmart is to maintain its relevancy in retail. (See also: Behind Walmart\u0027s 102.57% Rise In 10 Years).\n\nIn fact, it is not the only company signing onto the technology. Target Inc. (TGT) has created a position within its organization dedicated to exploring the applications of blockchain within its organization. French retail behemoth Carrefour is also exploring the use of blockchain. According to a study conducted by consulting firm Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) last year, cost savings are a major consideration for retailers in using blockchain. Eighty-two percent of respondents to a survey conducted by the firm said they expected overall supply chain costs to go down by 2.5%. Thirty-six percent of respondents expected savings greater than 5%.\n\n",

    "summary": "Meet the HTC Exodus, the world’s first blockchain-powered smartphone, due to launch later this year.\n\n",
    "content": "The Taiwanese electronics manufacturer HTC Corp. on Tuesday unveiled its Exodus smartphone. The blockchain-powered smartphone, which runs on Google’s Android mobile operating system will have a universal digital wallet and hardware support for cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps (dApps). It will act as a convenient handheld device that will serve a dual purpose: as a connecting point to the world of decentralized networks on a user’s mobile, and as a storage device for the users willing to carry their cryptocoins with them in their pockets.\n\nBlockchain Phone Expected by Year-End\n\nThe phone is expected to be made available by the end of this year. During the initial launch, the phone will have support for bitcoin, ethereum and a few other major blockchain networks. HTC will bring in support for other networks later on in a phased manner.\n\nIt is being built to provide enhanced security for a variety of digital assets that can be stored in the handheld device and will offer the convenience to use that many other present-day digital wallets lack. The smartphone will also feature an API that will allow developers to build additional apps based on the networks integrated with the blockchain-supported ecosystem.\n\nThe Taiwanese company foresees a deeper use of the Exodus phone as a network node for the native blockchain network to support cryptocurrency trading between participants. It also plans to include a digital store, similar to Google Play store, for hosting distributed apps. The store will act as an interface to offerings within and around existing blockchain networks, like ethereum, along with the possibility of building, launching and hosting new apps.\n\nRaymond Pao, HTC’s associate vice president of virtual reality technology, said that they \"will be building the framework and phone that powers the decentralized web.\"\"We believe smartphones will be a critical component for the entire crypto ecosystem. This phone will act as the hub, just like the PC did in the early days of the Internet,\" he told CoinDesk.\n\nHTC Targeting Large User Base of Smartphones\n\nWith some 3 billion smartphones being actively used around the globe, it makes an obvious choice to integrate the path-breaking blockchain technology with a handheld device for ease of use for the end consumer.\n\nInterestingly, in a bid to lend support to the cryptocurrency world, HTC will only accept payments in bitcoin and ethereum for the forthcoming pre-sale of the Exodus smartphone.

    "summary": "De Beers will launch the first industry-wide blockchain platform in a bid to crack down on \"conflict diamonds.\"\n\n",
    "content": "De Beers, the diamond unit of Anglo American, is harnessing blockchain technology to keep track of every movement of a gem. Set to launch later this year, the new industry-wide blockchain aims to document the movement of diamonds and other gems from the time they are dug up from the ground.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency is the most prominent application of blockchain technology at this point, it is but one of many. Increasingly, businesses of all types have looked to the emerging technology as a means of upgrading their models, adding security and documenting transactions. (See also: Is Apple Planning to Use Blockchain?)Authenticity Checks\n\nAccording to Reuters, one of the primary goals of this new application of blockchain technology is to authenticate diamond transactions. De Beers is the largest diamond producer in the world by value, and it has a long history of working toward authenticating diamonds as a way of insuring that they do not come from conflict zones or other sources of violence.\n\nMaintaining accurate and detailed histories of individual stones is essential to De Beers\u0027 reputation among its customers. As a result, it has widely shared technology used to authenticate diamonds with other industry players in the past.\n\nBlockchain can be a useful tool in this process, according to De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver. \"It\u0027s a huge public ledger as immutable as anything invented. It\u0027s a much more un-hackable system than anything on a single server,\" he explained.\n\nBlockchain Could Supplement Existing Methods\n\nFor the time being, it doesn\u0027t appear that De Beers will give up on its existing methods of tracking diamond transactions and authenticating individual stones. Rather, blockchain technology may complement existing tools. Regardless, the goal is to find a secure way of tracking diamonds and a sure-fire guarantee that individual diamonds are conflict-free.\n\nDe Beers plans to open its ledger to the industry in order to assist in the broader monitoring of diamonds worldwide. \"It has the ability to be very significant for the industry,\" Cleaver suggested, adding that blockchain could help to make the mining supply chain more efficient. (See also: What Is Blockchain and Why Should I Care?)For De Beers, the project has been several months in the making: the company began its pilot project this month. \"It\u0027s a bold step going public with a pilot, but we\u0027re going public because we\u0027re interested in the entire industry participating,\" Cleaver explained. The participants in the pilot were not disclosed.\n\nIn a related application of blockchain technology, startup Everledger has indicated that it has used blockchain to track diamonds since 2015. The tool could also be expanded to aid in insuring the ethical origins of other minerals as well.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "title": "4 New Platforms Combining VR and Blockchain\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "New solutions that combine both blockchain and virtual reality are emerging.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain, a decentralized ledger technology with relevant applications in finance, data storage, cybersecurity and investing, doesn’t seem like a likely candidate for virtual reality (VR). The former is a somewhat complicated platform relying on a blend of algorithmic cryptography to achieve autonomous consensus between individuals, and the latter an immersive new way to experience games and entertain oneself. However, these young inventions are finding new applications with each passing day, and are slowly drifting closer together. The market now has several examples of unique, useful solutions that combine both blockchain and VR — with others joining soon, as the trend catches on.\n\n1. Decentraland\n\nThough VR can now claim a purpose in the fields of science, engineering and more, Decentraland takes it back to its roots: the gaming world. This virtual world is accessible through any normal VR headset and is hosted entirely on the blockchain. Accordingly, it has some unique implications, including the ability to verifiably own the property that one inhabits.\n\nPlayers must register themselves on the ledger to participate, and can use cryptocurrency to record their irrefutable ownership over parcels of land onto it. A player’s virtual land can be developed (literally) with houses, businesses or other services just like in the popular game Second Life, and monetized accordingly. Virtual denizens have flocked to the “terraforming” event to reserve their spot in Genesis City, helping Decentraland raise $24 million in a crowdsale for the project within just 35 seconds.\n\n2. Ceek\n\nOne of the most applicable uses of virtual reality is to transport the viewer to a place they cannot be physically. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a custom virtual world, and this is what Ceek demonstrates to an enthusiastic public. Ceek enlists an impressive combination of VR production and blockchain smart contracts to allow anyone with a headset to attend live VR concerts and other events with their favorite celebrities and musicians.\n\nCeek token holders can vote for the acts they want to see thanks to robust ERC20 Ethereum smart contract capabilities, and fund-curated content from the community that might not involve famous people at all. Such a unique model also encourages users to get together in Ceek City, a virtual venue complete with areas to hang out, chat and watch the show together.\n\n3. GazeCoin\n\nGazeCoin is a unique blockchain solution that seeks to solve the issue that advertisers have in the new VR medium. Where current advertising methods for VR are still optimized for framed media, this approach is difficult to measure in terms of results because users aren’t interacting with a mouse. Key performance indicators have largely gone undeveloped for VR until now.\n\nGazeCoin uses a custom engine to track a VR viewer’s eye movements, which can determine exactly how much attention they’re paying to sponsored content, rewarding them and advertisers proportionately. Brands who develop their own VR experiences can create derivative tokens built on the GazeCoin platform as well, providing them with a proprietary token while also contributing value to the underlying blockchain.\n\n4. Blockchain 3D Explorer\n\nWhile it’s somewhat of a novel idea, those who are curious about the inner workings of the admittedly complicated blockchain can view it working in real time in a virtual reality environment. The simple 3D rendering of the decentralized ledger is a thing to behold and helps put in perspective how the network is organized. One can even pinpoint exact transactions on the network and watch as they move from node to node.\n\nBlockchain 3D Explorer is an excellent tool for teaching blockchain to the uninitiated, made even better because it’s provided for free on the various platforms that support it, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBoth VR and blockchain boundaries are still being tested, considering the relative youth of these fields. However, one thing is clear: innovators are not waiting for the next best thing — they’re actively working to create and build it. While each contributor takes a different approach to incorporating these technologies, the possibilities for the future are endless. As VR evolves and is embraced by the mainstream, it will help blockchain continue offering new immersive experiences and opportunities for development.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A new report tallies corporate investments in blockchain technology and these three companies are among the top five.\n\n",
    "content": "Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) is mostly known for its search engine. But it is also making significant investments into a blockchain future. (See also: Forget Bitcoin: Blockchain is the Future.)According to a recent report published by research firm CB Insights, the Mountain View, California-based tech behemoth is the second-largest corporate investor in blockchain. Other prominent companies putting their money into blockchain technology include the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C).\n\nGoogle’s investment in blockchain spans a varied spectrum. It has invested in Storj-io, a decentralized cloud storage company, as well as payments network Ripple, which has rapidly gained traction in recent times. It is also a major investor in Veem, a payments service provider that uses bitcoin for money transfers, as well as Buttercoin, an open source digital trading engine to arrange trades in an order book.\n\nCitigroup and Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, are mostly focused on investing in outfits that develop payment service engines. For example, both companies are investors in Digital Asset Holdings, a company that provides services related to distributed ledger, a blockchain technology, to finance institutions. The world’s top blockchain investor, however, is SBI Holdings, a Japanese financial services company that inked a partnership with Ripple last year.\n\nTo be sure, these companies are also exploring the uses of blockchain in internal projects. For example, Alphabet company DeepMind announced a project earlier this year to track usage of health care records. CB Insights states that corporate interest in blockchain is mostly focused on private blockchain development, with investment from the top 10 U.S. banks since 2014 hitting $267 million this year. (See also: JP Morgan Unveils Money Transfer Project.)Increased investment is no guarantee of success, however. According to the report, blockchain companies are failing at a higher rate as compared to other tech startups. Out of 103 blockchain companies with initial seed funding, only 28% made it to the next round and, only one - a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange - was able to sustain operations to Series D. Forty-six percent of all tech companies in other industries made it to the next round.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain has been hailed as a game-changing technology which will transform virtually every industry. So why hasn\u0027t it seen mass adoption yet?\n\nCross-border payments ($4 billion) On-boarding client costs ($1 billion) Fraud solutions ($9 billion) Source: McKinsey \u0026 Co.\n\n",
    "content": "Despite talk of Bitcoin\u0027s broad acceptance in the market, retail banks have not yet fully embraced blockchain technology and are less likely to be able to capitalize on its benefits, according to new research from McKinsey \u0026 Co. It may be cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have suffered from a declining reputation following the initial crypto craze of 2017, which have made the \"retail banking sector nervous and cautious,\" says Matt Higginsin, an author of the report quoted in a detailed article by Bloomberg. This skepticism could be preventing banks from saving as much as $4 billion a year through the application of blockchain technology to issues like cross-border payments, as well as an additional $1 billion per year in client on-boarding operating costs. Blockchain could also help to curb losses associated with fraud to the tune of as much as $9 billion annually, according to the report.\n\nWhy Banks Avoid Blockchain\n\nWhile more adventurous investment banks, governments and even infrastructure providers have explored the numerous applications of blockchain technology, retail banks have been much slower to adopt the new tool. There are many potential reasons for this, including a strict regulatory environment in the consumer finance industry, per Bloomberg. The fact that there are already strong alternative payment services in the digital space such as Zelle could also be a determining factor.\n\nThe biggest barrier to retail bank blockchain adoption, however, is likely its connections with the cryptocurrency space. Cryptocurrencies tend to have a bad reputation, despite the fact that they are gaining broad acceptance by major mainstream companies like Facebook (FB) and Fidelity. To many, however, cryptocurrencies appear to be an unregulated, Wild West-like industry replete with bankruptcies, fraud, companies going out of business, price collapses and a general lack of transparency.\n\nWhat It Means\n\nSo long as retail banks avoid utilizing blockchain, they are missing out on billions in potential savings, per McKinsey. Banks, with their intense focus on cost reduction, could stand to save as much as $14 billion per year thanks to blockchain applications. Savings like this wouldn\u0027t even require retail banks to go all in on using blockchain to do everything from processing payments to issuing bonds, as some investment banks have done. However, retail banks also have the significant challenge of convincing their customers to change their behavior, a process Atakan Hilal, another author of the McKinsey report, described as \"rather difficult.\" Further, retail banks would likely need to change the way they see rival firms in order to embrace new forms of cooperation as they work to build trust as a digital entity in a decentralized network.\n\nWhat\u0027s Next\n\nSome retail banks, like Santander, have begun to explore blockchain solutions to issues like money transfers. However, retail banks remain hesitant to dive in to blockchain applications. So long as Bitcoin and other digital currencies lack a reputation for stability and security, this may continue to be the case.\n\n",

(See also: 4 Blockchain Contenders in Competition with Ethereum.)Although these startups tend to publish detailed whitepapers, these documents are not always helpful to outside investors or to those not already intimately familiar with the blockchain world. Here are a few startups that may be worth special attention in 2018.\n\nAgrello\n\nSmart contracts are a huge component of the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, and Agrello hopes to revolutionize them. (See also: Are Smart Contracts the Best of Blockchain?)Agrello, an Estonian company, aims to combine artificial intelligence with legal documentation to bring smart contracts to people without extensive blockchain experience.\n\nAgrello\u0027s interface allows users to easily create self-executing and legally binding smart contracts over the ethereum network, regardless of their level of programming experience or legal knowledge.\n\nBloom\n\nMicrolending has already upended the way that individuals in underserved parts of the world are able to access the broader financial system, and Bloom hopes to take that concept even further with the idea of a decentralized, blockchain-based network.\n\nIndividuals who do not have access to credit cannot develop a credit reference; Bloom aims to utilize non-credit-based payment info to generate a new type of credit score called a Bloomscore. With this, individuals who may not previously have had access to loans and other traditional banking mechanisms may finally be able to reach those things.\n\nEverex\n\nThe financial world has long been dominated by contracts of all types. With Everex, an untapped market of roughly 2 billion people around the world who lack access to standard financial institutions will now have the opportunity to utilize services like currency exchange, microfinance, and remittance.\n\nEverex plans to do this by using a technology called \"cryptocash,\" which links up a cryptocurrency\u0027s token value to a specified fiat currency. Users will be able to convert their local currency into cryptocash through the Everex platform, providing them access to a large global network of services.\n\nSelfkey\n\nThe above startups, and indeed many of the blockchain-based companies hitting the market at this point, all focus on the financial world. One of the promising features of blockchain technology, however, is that it has applications outside of that space, too. (See also: How Blockchain Is Changing the Energy Industry.)Selfkey, for example, is a startup that strives to address self-sovereign identity issues. In past decades, as a digital identities have become increasingly common and complex, complicated issues of ownership have arisen.

    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nA blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that invests exclusively in a basket of blockchain-based companies. The companies held by a blockchain ETF have business operations in blockchain technology or invest or profit from the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are distinct from cryptocurrency ETFs, which invest in a basket of digital currencies such as bitcoin. However, a blockchain ETF can provide exposure to some of the technologies that are exploring digital ledger technology.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain ETFs\n\nA blockchain is a shared ledger that stores all information regarding a transaction (date, time, dollar amount, etc.). This ledger is decentralized, meaning it is not kept in one location but distributed across a network that can be viewed by the public. The information in the ledger is also incorruptible.\n\nProponents believe that blockchain technology can enable people to communicate crucial data in a safe, tamper-proof manner. Just about anything can be recorded and stored on a blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a chance to make money from this technology, which has the potential to revolutionize business and be used by everyone. These funds invest in various companies making money from blockchain in some form. Some of them are actively managed while others are passively managed and simply track a specific index.\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer dual benefits—pooled investments in baskets of stocks like that of a mutual fund, and real-time trading with tick-by-tick price changes like that of a stock.\n\nApplications of Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. This technology isn’t just limited to digital currencies, though. Blockchain can potentially be used in any situation where data recordkeeping is required.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to deliver information in a quick, secure, and transparent fashion, even between mutually distrustful parties. Those characteristics have led some proponents to predict that blockchain could end up being as groundbreaking as the internet was.\n\nHow Blockchain Works\n\nA blockchain can in some way be compared to spreadsheets. It is essentially a database where information is entered and stored. Where a blockchain differs from a spreadsheet is in how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nThe blockchain process essentially takes the following steps:Different Services/Industries That Blockchain Is Used in\n\nThousands of cryptocurrency systems run on a blockchain. But that’s not the technology’s only use. Companies in many other industries have explored pilots using blockchains and similar ledger technology to store data for other types of transactions. Proponents believe that it can speed transaction times, demand less oversight and resources, and is harder to hack and manipulate.\n\nThose benefits have prompted several big-name companies to invest in blockchain. Industries that have seen a use for blockchain include:Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe terms bitcoin and blockchain are sometimes used interchangeably, despite being two different things: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while blockchain is the underlying database technology.\n\nBlockchain is not tied to any one specific company or product. it is a technology that can be used across various industries. Blockchain ETFs invest in various companies listed on the stock market, many of which also have other operations outside of blockchain, rather than a specific coin. This makes them more diversified and less volatile.\n\nAnother notable difference is regulation and availability. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been heavily scrutinized by government authorities. For many years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resisted applications by companies seeking to launch a cryptocurrency ETF, citing fears of market manipulation. The first bitcoin futures ETF in the United States was approved in October 2021, and the first bitcoin spot ETF in January 2024.\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs come with additional risks due to the inherent volatility of digital currency. In addition, they may have higher expense ratios due to the cost of custodying digital assets.\n\nCriticism of Blockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs are a relatively recent phenomenon. As such, it is difficult to determine trends or derive conclusive results from their performance.\n\nMany blockchain ETFs have witnessed positive returns.However, investors are still concerned with the long-term prospects of blockchain ETFs. As is the case with any breakthrough technology, there is no guarantee blockchain will live up to its potential and become widely used across multiple industries.\n\nBlockchain ETFs also come with the inherent risk of investing in technology-based startups, at least while the blockchain concept is still evolving, and hitting regulatory roadblocks across the globe.\n\nExample of Blockchain ETFs\n\nTwo popular blockchain ETFs include the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) ETF and the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETF.\n\nThe Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy seeks to replicate the returns of the Siren Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, an index made up of global companies committed to blockchain development. The fund is described as passive but does have some discretion in selecting companies.\n\nAs of January 2024, BLCN, which was one of the first ETFs to focus on blockchain technology, had $71.8 million in assets under management and a five-year annualized return of 4.38%. Its top holdings are Galaxy Digital Holdings, Coinbase Global, Inc., and Microstrategy Inc., with an expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nThe Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF is an actively managed fund investing in companies developing or using what it calls “transformational data sharing technologies.” It has no underlying index and carries an expense ratio of 0.75%.\n\nThe fund, as of January 2024, has assets under management of $850 million and a five-year annualized return of 17.55%. BLOK invests 47% of its assets in technology services and 19% in financial services. Its top holdings, as of October 2023, are Coinbase Global, Inc., Microstrategy, Inc., and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs give investors a way to potentially make money from blockchain technology. These ETFs spread their bets on a number of companies at the forefront of blockchain, a technology that some people believe could be as groundbreaking as the internet.\n\nBlockchain is best known for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of all cryptocurrency transactions. But it isn’t just limited to that. Many industries need to record, safely store, and track data, and blockchain has been touted as an effective way to do this.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "title": "Permissioned Blockchain: Definition, Examples, Vs. Permissionless\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Permissioned blockchains require participants to identify themselves and assign defined roles to perform only permitted activities.\n\nPermissioned blockchains provide an additional level of security over typical blockchain systems like Bitcoin, as they require an access control layer. These blockchains are favored by entities who require security, identity, and role definition within the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are becoming more common as businesses realize their benefits.\n\nTechnically, properly conceived permissioned blockchain networks have an access-control layer built into the blockchain nodes.\n\nMuch of the time, businesses creating or using a \"blockchain\" are not using a blockchain; they build a distributed ledger with a consensus mechanism for verifying transactions. It can be tough to distinguish the difference because there is not yet a set definition that truly separates blockchain and DLT.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Permissioned Blockchain?\n\nA permissioned blockchain is a distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible. It can only be accessed by users with permissions. The users can only perform specific actions granted to them by the ledger administrators and are required to identify themselves through certificates or other digital means.\n\nYou might consider the addition of permissioned users as an extra blockchain security system. Administrators maintain an access control layer to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants. Records are kept within the blockchain of who is involved in the transactions. This makes permissioned blockchains different from public blockchains.\n\nUnderstanding Permissioned Blockchains\n\nA blockchain can be built and accessed in multiple ways. Some blockchains need special permissions to read, access, and write information. Others only require that you have the ability to connect and can conduct work for the network. The intrinsic configuration of each blockchain controls the participants\u0027 transactions and defines their roles in which each participant can access and contribute to the blockchain.\n\nIt may also include maintaining the identity of each blockchain participant on the network. Such blockchains are called permissioned blockchains.\n\nDifference Between Permissionless and Permissioned Blockchains\n\nPermissioned blockchains are similar to permissionless blockchains because they use the same technologies. However, permissioned blockchains do not allow users to access the blockchain without identification.\n\nFor example, a bank may be running a permissioned blockchain operated through a designated number of nodes internal to the bank to track money transfers. You cannot access this blockchain because you don\u0027t have the permissions required. In contrast, you could join a permissionless blockchain like a cryptocurrency mining network once you have established a semi-anonymous account in that network.\n\nMuch of the inner workings of the blockchains are the same. The key differences between them are:Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency permissionless blockchain, allows anyone to participate in the network in the capacity of a full node or a contributing miner. Anyone can take a read-only role or make legitimate changes to the blockchain, like adding a new block or maintaining a full copy of the entire blockchain.\n\nAs blockchain uses grow and mature, more businesses and governments have realized the cost-saving benefits the technology introduces into an organization. As a result, permissioned blockchains have become popular among industry-level firms and enterprises, for which security, identity, and role definition are essential.\n\nFor instance, a manufacturer producing a product may use a permissioned blockchain that ties into its supply chain management. The transactions on this blockchain would likely involve logistics partners, financing banks, and other vendors involved in the supply and financing processes. Each entity would have its own level of transparency and permissions that it could use to streamline operations, track inventory, or monitor spending and invoicing.\n\nPermissionless blockchains have a broad decentralization in that they allow for more users and can extend across a much larger network. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains have limited decentralization as they are generally used for enterprise and business purposes, requiring various amounts of centralization.\n\nGenerally, permissionless blockchains are open source, which means that a community develops them; they can be changed and used by anyone. Permissioned blockchains are generally proprietary and controlled by the developers or the business using them.\n\nA developer building a permissioned blockchain may opt to make a few select records, like product name and quantity involved in a transaction, available for everyone to read. However, only select participants are allowed to view the transaction price. Other implementations may include limiting participants to act as nodes on the network, enhancing the network\u0027s security.\n\nAll such permissioning and profile maintenance is handled by this access-control layer. These differ from the un-permissioned or public blockchain networks, which don’t have a control layer.\n\nPermissionless blockchains are much less transparent since they provide a certain amount of anonymity for the users. Wallet addresses cannot generally be tracked back to the blockchain users, and transactions are encrypted using various cryptography methods.\n\nPermissioned blockchains require more transparency at certain levels since they are used for conducting business. Nodes, or the users and their connections, are known and their transactions are visible. Among many other benefits, this can defend a company against double invoicing, spending, paying, or any other number of errors that can be made using enterprise management programs.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Proponents of blockchain believe in the technology’s disruptive potential. Find out which industries blockchain is likely to disrupt in coming years.\n\nBlockchain technology can improve all organizations, regardless of industry, by enhancing human resource management and accounting processes. Enterprises in the private sector, from insurance companies to manufacturers to philanthropies, can uniquely benefit from blockchain technology. Almost every entity and service in the public sector—such as elections—could be improved by incorporating blockchain technology.\n\n",
    "content": "Even as digital currencies fade from widespread interest or become illegal or heavily regulated, blockchain technology is likely here to stay. That’s because it has tremendous flexibility and the ability to disrupt almost every industry and sector of the market. It has the potential to touch every company’s accounting, corporate governance, and human resources departments. But it may also profoundly impact sectors such as banking, cloud computing, healthcare, insurance, and real estate.\n\nWidespread Disruption Across Industries\n\nThere are some ways that blockchain technology can benefit all organizations, regardless of industry, such as:Blockchain technology can benefit accountants by automating data collection and organization and many routine accounting functions like payroll. Blockchain tech can potentially reduce instances of human error and fraud.\n\nBlockchain technology can increase the transparency of how an organization is governed through smart contracts—electronic agreements that automatically execute based on predetermined conditions. Blockchain technology can also enable shareholder voting by proxy and collaboration on proposals.\n\nManaging human resources can become more efficient by using blockchain technology. Smart contracts can perform functions like conducting background checks and verifying employment histories more quickly.\n\nPrivate-Sector Disruptions\n\nBlockchain may have a specific and profound impact on some specific industries and market sectors. For example:The legal cannabis industry is tightly regulated, which creates an opportunity for blockchain technology to make regulatory compliance for cannabis companies more efficient. Blockchain tech can increase the transparency of the cannabis supply chain, boosting the safety of the product and proving its legal status.\n\nBlockchain technology may help to decentralize cloud computing, making cloud technology’s use of computing resources and data storage more efficient. Decentralizing data storage could also make cloud-based networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain-based web browsers may change how online advertising works. Blockchain tech can enable companies to advertise directly to internet users, with consumers receiving fewer ads that are better targeted to their interests.\n\nA blockchain-based distributed ledger can track the histories, provenances, and archival materials for collectible art pieces. The arts are already being disrupted by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—which also use blockchain technology—being used to signify ownership of digital art.\n\nBlockchain technology is well suited to making food and beverage supply chains safer and more efficient. Food supply chains on a blockchain are more transparent, which enables tracing contamination to its source to occur more quickly. Certifications like being organic could also be more easily verified, with blockchain technology providing more visibility into the supply chain.\n\nDistributed ledgers enabled by blockchain tech can enable gamers to transport personas, skill sets, and digital assets across gaming platforms.\n\nHospital systems and other healthcare networks could use blockchain technology to share data, including patient records, more efficiently and securely. Permissioned blockchains may enable records to be efficiently shared without compromising privacy.\n\nBlockchain technology could help to establish consensus among the various parties involved with insurance claims, making processing claims more efficient. The technology could also facilitate cross-border insurance coverage and payments.\n\nThere are many ways that blockchain tech can potentially improve internet security. Blockchain technology could eliminate the need for human intermediaries, significantly reducing fraud, corruption, and human error. Blockchain tech can also make Internet of Things (IoT) networks more secure.\n\nBlockchain technology can bring much-needed transparency to online gambling, potentially disrupting the ability of digital casinos to tilt the odds in their favor. Players can also potentially maintain greater anonymity through blockchain-based betting platforms.\n\nBlockchain technology can potentially speed up the pharmaceutical industry’s drug discovery, which is notoriously slow, by enabling more and better collaboration among researchers. The drug development process can become safer with blockchain tech increasing the transparency of the process.\n\nPhotographic licensing and copyright information can be managed and stored using blockchain tech. Photographers and creators can use the technology to connect directly with their supporters and control their pricing and distribution.\n\nApplying blockchain technology to real estate transactions could make transferring property more efficient. Blockchain tech can potentially record and track real estate transactions and ensure documentation accuracy.\n\nBlockchain platforms could significantly disrupt the retail industry, including brick-and-mortar stores and ecommerce. Decentralized marketplaces can enable buyers and sellers to connect directly, which could lower prices by eliminating the markups charged by retailers. Sellers could avoid fees and restrictions traditionally imposed by retailers. Potentially, retailers can use blockchain technology to enhance gift card and loyalty programs.\n\nPublic-Sector Disruption\n\nBlockchain technology is also increasingly in use by the public sector. Government agencies, more than private-sector enterprises, are plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiencies that blockchain technology can potentially remedy. Blockchain tech can also make governments more transparent and potentially less susceptible to corruption.\n\nFor example, ensuring that voting processes are fair and accountable is a major concern worldwide. Some have posited that blockchain could help to enhance this process and increase reliability and security. Using blockchain technology, voting processes could potentially improve everything from voter registration to vote counting. The blockchain’s distributed ledgers are publicly accessible and immutable, which would increase transparency in the process. However, a 2020 report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) raised serious concerns about the security of blockchain voting.\n\nHow Blockchain Tech Is Disrupting Finance\n\nBlockchain technology, as the core component of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is already disrupting the payments sector of finance. But blockchain tech can potentially disrupt the payments sector even further, transforming several other subsectors within the finance industry.\n\nAdditionally, some companies have already used blockchain technology to develop global decentralized prediction markets. And blockchain could help streamline data organization in forecasting ranging from traffic models to the weather. Here are the financial sectors likely to see major disruption in the years to come:Companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology. With blockchain, users around the globe could gain access to banking opportunities that they wouldn’t otherwise have. Particularly, individuals in developing nations and without standard banks readily accessible can use blockchain to access these services.\n\nPartnering with digital currencies, blockchain could allow for instant transfers of money between countries without major fees and delay times. While some mainstream financial institutions in the United States were initially reluctant to delve into the cryptocurrency market, they were much less reticent about exploring the possibilities inherent in blockchain technology.\n\nCrowdfunding has risen to prominence in the past several years to become one of the most popular ways for individuals to raise funds for all kinds of projects and goals. At the source of crowdfunding is a relationship of trust between those seeking to fund a project and others willing to contribute donations to support those goals.\n\nCrowdfunding sites typically sustain themselves by charging fees for their services, acting as a middleman between project developers and givers. Blockchain could help reduce the need for a middleman, better connecting project managers to those willing to give efficiently.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBusinesses have already explored the ways that blockchain can revolutionize the way that:With the sheer number of industries and sectors that blockchain technology can potentially disrupt, it’s very likely that blockchain technology is here to stay. The impact on the world of blockchain tech will continue to grow as the technology also develops further.\n\n",

    "summary": "Blockchain can help the flow of data and money in emerging economies.\n\nIn the most general sense, a blockchain is a system for recording information, although it is distinct from a typical database in the way it stores information; the information in a blockchain is stored in such a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. This impressive technology provides the support necessary for the decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. While blockchains allow for cryptocurrencies to function, their functionality has applications beyond cryptocurrency. In diverse countries such as India, Kenya, and East Africa, blockchain technology has found uses in banking and financial services, supply chains, agriculture, and in managing land ownership records.\n\nAs of June 2023, CoinMarketCap reported over 25,000 different types of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. In a study since, only 5% of all sales have been paid in bitcoin through the country\u0027s Chivo Wallet.\n\n",
    "content": "When most people hear the word blockchain, which refers to a type of decentralized ledger technology, they immediately connect the term with cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to keep in mind that bitcoin just happened to be one of blockchain’s earliest and most popular applications; most experts believe that the potential for other applications of blockchain technology is vast.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nIn the most general sense, a blockchain is a system for recording information, although it is distinct from a typical database in the way it stores information; the information in a blockchain is stored in such a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.\n\nBlockchain technology promises a secure, peer-to-peer mechanism for verifying information. Each \"block\" in a blockchain contains a record of transactions in a decentralized ledger. Taken together, the blocks form a “chain” in a peer-to-peer network.\n\nApplications for Blockchain Technology\n\nThis impressive technology provides the support necessary for the decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. While blockchains allow for cryptocurrencies to function, their functionality has applications beyond cryptocurrency. For example, banking and fintech payment companies have already demonstrated a major interest in blockchain technology.\n\nFrom insurance and real estate to crowdfunding and data management, the potential applications of blockchain technology are numerous, and it\u0027s likely that there will continue to be new ways of adapting this technology to the mainstream business world in the future.\n\nHowever, there is one important use of blockchain technology that exists outside its more traditional business applications: Some of the world\u0027s emerging economies are benefiting from the integration of blockchain technology in various ways. In diverse countries such as India, Kenya, and East Africa, blockchain technology has found uses in banking and financial services, supply chains, agriculture, and in managing land ownership records.\n\nAmong its many advantages (first and foremost being its ability to keep data secure), blockchain technology also claims to speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, and boost financial inclusion by providing more opportunities for those without easy access to financial services.\n\nChallenges for Blockchain Implementation in Emerging Countries\n\nBefore we discuss opportunities, let\u0027s touch on why it may be particularly difficult for an emerging country to implement blockchain solutions. The hurdles below are not an exhaustive list but instead an overview of the unique challenges emerging countries must overcome.\n\nBanking Opportunities\n\nIn many parts of the world, individuals do not have easy access to banking services. With blockchain technology, users across the globe could access banking services where they otherwise wouldn\u0027t have the opportunity. Particularly, individuals in emerging economies where there are not standard banks readily accessible could make use of blockchain technology to access these services. One specific application is the use of blockchain for instant transfers of money between countries and without major fees and delay times.\n\nBlockchain also offers a visible, impermeable ledger, protecting the accuracy of financial transactions. This may lessen instances of fraud, corruption, and other wrongdoing that frequently occur in the banking industry. Emerging nations can improve the security and dependability of their banking systems, boosting user confidence, by utilizing the immutability and transparency of the blockchain.\n\nLast, access to credit is frequently restricted in emerging economies, especially for those without established credit histories. Blockchain can make it possible to develop decentralized credit scoring systems that use alternate data sources, including transaction records and payment histories, to evaluate creditworthiness. This could create opportunities for people and companies to receive loans and credit facilities based on their credit profiles created using blockchain technology.\n\nExamples of Blockchain in Emerging Countries\n\nIn India, ConsenSys Ventures, a blockchain software firm, has worked with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, the Indian government’s policy think tank, on implementing blockchain in a land titling project. ConsenSys Ventures also signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh state government for an array of uses for its technology, including in land titling, supply chains, and health records.\n\nIn Kenya, IBM partnered with Twiga Foods, a business-to-business logistics platform for kiosks and food stalls across Africa, to extend micro-finance loans to vendors. These loans were intended to help vendors buy and manage more inventory. IBM\u0027s contribution was to build a blockchain-enabled lending platform that could determine the creditworthiness of the food vendors.\n\nIn Nigeria, blockchain technology has been used to monitor toxin levels along the River Niger, where efforts are underway to clean up the river belt. International organizations that are funding these projects rely on this data as part of their reporting requirements.\n\nHaiti, the victim of hurricane and earthquake damage caused over the last decade, also stands to benefit from blockchain.\n\nThe Haitian government has suggested that blockchain technology could be used to record and register property transactions, voting, intellectual property, and other aspects of bureaucracy. In 2019, the La Banque de la République d’Haïti announced that it was considering a pilot program utilizing blockchain technology to create a digital version of the Haitian Gourde. The goal of this project would be to improve the domestic payments system and promote financial inclusion in Haiti.\n\nOver the past few years, the Business Development and Investment (BDI) project in Haiti has helped thousands of producers. The BDI project was designed to support the reconstruction efforts after Haiti\u0027s 2010 earthquake, but was forced to redouble its efforts due to natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, assassination of its President, lockdown due to socio-political unrest, and gang-fueled insecurity.\n\nThe project aimed to attract private sector investment through the creation of special industrial zones but later shifted to facilitating the export of existing high-quality agricultural products. To enable farmers to obtain higher prices, the project helped develop the capacity of third-party service providers, providing them with standard operating procedures, access to quality transport and logistics services, and supplying them with working capital. The entire project hinged on a blockchain solution for traceability and payments was developed, allowing direct payments to farmers.\n\nThe Future of Blockchain Technology in Emerging Economies\n\nFor Paul Domjan, former global head of research, analytics, and data at investment bank Tellimer (formerly Exotix), emerging nations are the most promising beneficiaries of blockchain tech. He argues that, because \"frontier markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia lag far behind [in the area of ownership recording], with average performance less than half that of the best-performing economies,\" they are primed for the benefits of blockchain.\n\nAmnesty International program director Mark Dummett has voiced cautious support for the integration of blockchain into efforts to address these and other problems plaguing developing nations, saying, \"You have to be wary of technological solutions to problems that are also political and economic, but blockchain may help. We\u0027re not against it.\"The Bottom Line\n\nBesides the applications listed above, supporters of blockchain believe that it could enhance the distribution of government services in these nations, help to provide identity services, and even help to enhance freedom of speech and anti-corruption activities as well.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions are two types of improvements to the processing speed of any cryptocurrency network.\n\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 crypto blockchain scaling solutions help increase the overall throughput—another name for processing speed—of a blockchain network. Layer 1 scaling includes updates to main blockchains, such as the block size, consensus mechanism, or database partitioning. Layer 2 scaling includes bundling transactions, processing in parallel, or handling transactions off-chain. Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling may compromise the security of a blockchain.\n\nWith continued increases in network demand, blockchain networks will rely on scaling solutions such as Layer 1 and Layer 2 to provide stable and efficient transaction handling in the future.\n\nInstead of requiring computing power to mine the next block in a crypto blockchain, PoS uses a lottery system to award block recordings to stakers, allowing the blockchain to be faster in return.\n\n",
    "content": "Layer 1 and Layer 2: An Overview\n\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions are improvements to the throughput—or processing speed—of any cryptocurrency blockchain network. They can include protocol updates or additional network solutions to help process more transactions.\n\nLayer 1 includes updates such as changing block sizes, consensus mechanisms, or splitting the database into multiple parts (known as sharding). Layer 2 includes rollups (bundling transactions), parallel blockchains (known as side chains), and off-chain handling of transactions (known as state channels).\n\nWhy Layer 1 and Layer 2 Scaling Solutions Are Important\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized network of nodes that processes crypto transactions independently, with consensus protocols that verify the accuracy of the transactions. The transactions are then recorded sequentially, forming a chain of data blocks that can’t be changed.\n\nUnfortunately, the more popular a blockchain becomes (Bitcoin is a case in point), the more processing power it needs to handle its growing number of transactions. Cryptocurrency blockchain protocols also may limit the number of transactions that can be processed, creating a bottleneck in the network.\n\nThis has caused popular blockchain networks to become very slow, sometimes taking up to 10 minutes (or more) to process a transaction. To solve this issue, scaling activities have been developed to help provide a more efficient means of holding a much larger volume of transactions.\n\nThere are several ways to scale each network, and dozens of scaling solutions have been developed for various popular blockchains. These solutions help offload the transaction processing power onto other networks or improve the base-layer network itself through a code update.\n\nLayer 1 Blockchains vs. Layer 2 Blockchains\n\nA Layer 1 blockchain is the base architecture for a decentralized cryptocurrency network. Examples of Layer 1 blockchains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. These blockchains handle transaction processing and network security through a shared consensus mechanism, such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS).\n\nA Layer 2 blockchain refers to another blockchain or set of protocols layered \"on top\" of a Layer 1 solution. Layer 2 protocols use the Layer 1 blockchain for network and security infrastructure but are more flexible in their ability to scale transaction processing and overall throughput on the network. Examples are Polygon (which layers on top of Ethereum) and Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network. Coinbase launched Base, its Ethereum Layer 2 network, in August 2023.\n\nTypes of Layer 1 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are several ways to scale Layer 1 blockchains, including:Some Layer 1 cryptocurrency blockchains have updated their code to increase the block size, allowing more transactions to be verified at a time, thus expanding the overall capacity of the network. An example of this is the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network, which upgraded its block size to 8 megabytes (MBs) from 1 MB, then further to 32 MBs, theoretically allowing it to process more than 100 transactions per second vs. Bitcoin’s seven transactions per second.\n\nThe consensus mechanism of a blockchain validates transactions to ensure the accuracy and security of the network. Bitcoin, for example, uses proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, requiring tremendous processing power to solve a cryptographic puzzle to be allowed to record the next block in the blockchain. Once the puzzle is solved, the blockchain confirms transactions in the blocks by verifying block hashes.\n\nEthereum also initially used PoW but has since upgraded to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which requires node operators to lock up a large Ether (ETH) deposit to process transactions.\n\nSharding is similar to database partitioning, which allows a blockchain database to be broken up into smaller parts so that transactions can be processed simultaneously. This increases the overall capacity of a Layer 1 blockchain network.\n\nTypes of Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are also several types of Layer 2 blockchain scaling solutions, including:Instead of processing transactions individually, bundles of transactions can be “rolled up” into a single transaction, vastly increasing the number of transactions that can be processed at once. The transactions are outsourced to be recorded off-chain, bundled, and then brought onto the main chain to process as a single entity.\n\nSide chains are independent blockchain networks with their own set of validators that allow transactions to be processed in parallel. This vastly increases the transaction-processing power of a blockchain, but you must trust the integrity of the side chain network and the bridge network that connects it to the main blockchain.\n\nState channels are similar to a side chain, as transactions are recorded off-chain, but these transactions are recorded in bulk off-chain, and then the state of the channel is set at complete. The transactions are then recorded in bulk on the main blockchain network by broadcasting a completed “state” to the main network. This is how Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is set up.\n\nRisks of Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions\n\nWhile scaling a blockchain is a great way to improve transaction handling and increase overall adoption, there are a few risks inherent to using a scaling solution:The Bottom Line\n\nScaling a blockchain network is important to a cryptocurrency network\u0027s overall adoption and increased capacity. Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions help preserve the integrity of the underlying blockchain while improving the ability to handle far more transactions.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain may be the most important invention since the internet.\n\nLike many other top inventions, blockchain has more than one application or use case. Blockchain uses are being developed in the financial and healthcare industries, government, supply chains, and more. Many popular blockchains are slower than traditional financial systems; however, blockchain developers are working to increase speeds.\n\nDivision of information and how it is often channeled creates silos within governments, increasing inefficiency. Blockchain can solve this issue by securely distributing information to reach those who need it more quickly.\n\n",
    "content": "World-changing inventions like the printing press, the radio, and the internet opened new ways for people to communicate and share knowledge. In many cases, blockchain technology expands on these inventions. Blockchain provides a method to secure and distribute knowledge, data, and information so that it can be shared without alteration, interference, or be controlled.\n\nAlthough many contenders exist for the most important inventions, some people believe blockchain ranks among them. Read on to learn why blockchain might be one of the more important inventions of the early twenty-first century.\n\nBlockchain in Finance\n\nMoney does make the world go \u0027round, but there are also many issues surrounding its use. Here are some of the ways blockchain can be used in the financial industry.\n\nIt is natural for people to want as much money as possible, but with that desire comes the drive to get it in any way possible—many people resort to illegal or unethical means to fulfill their dreams of wealth.\n\nThe finance industry is teeming with temptations—money flows in and out of homes, businesses, and countries, and there never seems to be enough. There is so much capital circulating that it needs to be managed in a way that removes the temptation to act unethically.\n\nBlockchain can solve corruption issues within financial systems by eliminating the risk of duplicating or double-spending assets. Transactions are initiated, executed, recorded, encrypted, verified, and stored by nodes who manage \"an irreversible ledger of transactions\" and must reach a consensus to approve a new block—making it the perfect solution.\n\nThe primary reason behind creating blockchain and cryptocurrency was to create a decentralized method of exchanging value; in other words, transferring money to someone for services provided or goods received.\n\nTherefore, it can eliminate third parties like banks, payment processors, payment gateways, settlement banks, and other financial entities within our bloated and costly financial systems. Blockchain also allows people who do not have access to financial instruments like loans or other services to access them.\n\nCryptocurrency can be used if financial systems collapse. For example, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2021 and 2022, cryptocurrency became a major source of funding for the Ukrainians and the government—it recognized cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment in 2021.\n\nCryptocurrency was created using blockchain technology, but an unforeseen consequence of introducing cryptocurrency was that because it held exchangeable value, its value could fluctuate. People started paying for it, demand increased, prices rose, and investors saw an opportunity.\n\nCryptocurrencies are now widely purchased by investors as investments. It is also used by traders to make profits from price movements.\n\nBlockchain is revolutionizing banking and lending. Not only is it creating ways for consumers to lend to each other, but crypto lending companies have emerged that use blockchain in their loan approval process at significantly reduced costs. Costs are reduced because there are no lawyers, banks, paperwork, or other lengthy procedures.\n\nInsurance providers are exploring ways to implement blockchain into their systems and products. For example, insurance providers could collect information through blockchains to customize insurance products and reduce instances of fraud.\n\nBlockchains could be used to securely store client health information, uploaded whenever a patient is seen. The blockchain could send requests to insurance through smart contracts, which in turn, could instantly approve or disapprove care and transfer funds.\n\nOther insurance processes could also be streamlined, from finding coverage that meets your needs to filing claims and receiving payments.\n\nBlockchain and Government\n\nSome critical issues regarding government processes and infrastructure are inefficiency, corruption, fraud, waste, lack of trust, security, and siloing. Blockchain has the potential to reduce all of these issues significantly.\n\nGovernment silos are concentrations of information, resources, and decision-making. Critical information that is not shared keeps policy-makers and regulators from making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nResources can be properly tracked, accounted for, and transferred if needed. Data about businesses and citizens can be better secured, and payroll taxes can be collected more efficiently. Additionally, banks could settle intrabank loans in real-time rather than waiting for the end of the day, increasing transaction volume and making banking more efficient.\n\nWhen information is secured and distributed, it cannot be changed or withheld for the benefit of one party or another. Spending can be falsely reported; sometimes, money can disappear without a trace. Using blockchain, government funds can be tracked, and entities can be held accountable for spending.\n\nBlockchain Tech In Healthcare\n\nHealthcare is an industry that can significantly benefit from blockchain. As a secure method of sharing and storing information, blockchain technology cannot directly improve human health, but it can improve the systems used to share medical knowledge and information.\n\nIf blockchain could be integrated into the healthcare system, as some projects are aiming to accomplish, the technology could help improve lives and treatment plans.\n\nBlockchain and the Supply Chain\n\nBlockchain technology can also be used to track the movement of goods. For example, several companies are using distributed ledgers to track perishable goods while keeping track of essential variables like moisture and temperature.\n\nA critical concern in supply chain management is efficiency. Supply chains are vast networks of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Blockchain provides a method to track raw materials, sourcing, production methods, transportation times, payments, and many other supply chain activities that can create inefficiencies or issues.\n\nConcerns About Blockchain Technology\n\nEnthusiasm for blockchain technology is still far from universal. Many enterprises have been using the distributed ledger technology that blockchain evolved from for many years in permissioned environments. The key difference between the two is that blockchain uses programming to reach a consensus about the state of the distributed ledger.\n\nTo come to a consensual agreement about a massive ledger\u0027s state, database researchers and scientists created consensus mechanisms that use encryption methods for proof of transactions on the ledger. One such mechanism is proof-of-work, which requires large amounts of energy because of its competitive rewards nature.\n\nMany blockchains are also slower than centralized systems, with transactions confirmations times between dozens per second to thousands per second. When compared to modern financial systems that confirm tens of thousands of transactions per second, blockchains have been lagging behind—however, many developers are working to increase transactions speeds throughout the networks.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany of the most influential inventions of all time have a broad range of applications. The internet is one of the most recent that has impacted virtually every area of business and personal life since it came into common use in the 1990s. Blockchain, a newcomer, offers as many endless applications as the internet and other inventions proceeding it.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

How do blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs differ?\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are relatively new, while the number of blockchain ETFs is growing. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles and heavily scrutinized by government authorities.

In May 2024, the SEC also approved a rule change that would allow ETFs to hold the ether cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients as well.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs: An Overview\n\nAs Bitcoin earned a stable place within the investment community, Bitcoin and blockchain-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also gained investor interest. The emergence of these ETFs allows access to a broader spectrum of investors wanting exposure to these digital assets without the complications of direct asset management.\n\nBlockchain ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—offer a more diversified exposure to the broader blockchain industry across sectors like finance, supply chain management, and healthcare that the technology is changing. Alternatively, Bitcoin ETFs are more focused, providing more direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency.\n\nThese funds either hold Bitcoin directly or track its price through futures contracts, giving investors a way to benefit from Bitcoin\u0027s price appreciation without storing the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nDespite these differences, media reports frequently treat the terms \"Bitcoin\" and \"blockchain\" interchangeably. As a result, it\u0027s possible to confuse blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs, although they are different financial instruments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nBlockchain ETFs primarily track the stock prices of companies that have invested in blockchain technology in their fund, though they aren’t too focused on a specific cryptocurrency or entity. Blockchain is a technology not tied to a particular company or product.\n\n“Bitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn’t need Bitcoin,” said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, which says it’s the largest ETF focused on blockchain. The blockchain universe of investments is not restricted to a particular sector, such as IBM\u0027s blockchain relationships with the auto sector, wineries, and healthcare.\n\nOther firms whose shares are typically held by blockchain ETFs are Visa, which is exploring ways to use blockchain to restructure payment frictions, and Honeywell, a manufacturing company that uses blockchain for supply chain management.\n\nOn the technology front, Nvidia, the graphics processing units giant, provides hardware essential for cryptocurrency mining and blockchain operations and is a blockchain ETF mainstay.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC track the price of Bitcoin through futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In this model, ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin by owning futures contracts.\n\nIn October 2021, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF, tracking Bitcoin futures contracts pegged to the future price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince then, several other funds have launched to expose investors to the Bitcoin market without direct ownership of the currency, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI).\n\nSome funds focus on different crypto-related strategies. ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) allows investors to short Bitcoin, thus profiting from a decline rather than a rise in Bitcoin prices. Other ETFs invest in blockchain companies and Bitcoin futures, such as the Global X Blockchain and Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which blurs the line between these ETFs.\n\nFor many years, U.S. regulators rejected proposals for funds that hold Bitcoins directly, citing worries over the potential for fraud and market manipulation. The regulator also raised these concerns about Tether and other stablecoins.\n\nHowever, the SEC eventually relented in 2023, after a federal appeals court ruled that the regulator had provided insufficient justification for rejecting the ETF applications by the asset manager Grayscale Investments. After the ruling, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETFs, 11 of them, which began trading in January 2024.\n\nKey Differences\n\nUnderstanding the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and blockchain ETFs means knowing the difference between the instruments they track. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while a blockchain is the underlying database technology. This distinction is significant when considered within the context of investment instruments.\n\nEven though Bitcoin futures were already offered on the U.S.’s major exchanges, cryptocurrency’s regulatory status remains unclear in some jurisdictions. As adoption increased, virtual currencies have been embroiled in several regulatory battles for their role in criminal activities, such as money laundering.\n\nAlternatively, blockchain technology has won the interest of major companies in the world of legacy finance, including JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Visa. Blockchain technology is neither banned nor under scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Blockchain ETFs are also relatively stable compared with the volatility of Bitcoin since they are not exposed to Bitcoin’s price swings.\n\nThat said, blockchain is still considered a nascent technology. As such, the stock prices of companies tracked by the ETF are more susceptible to factors that do not affect blockchain technology. Bitcoin ETFs are also affected by regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are 26 blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs trading in U.S. markets, according to the ETF Database. As of May 24, 2024, these ETFs have a combined worth of just over $60 billion in assets under management (AUM), and their expense ratios range from 0.3% to 2.5%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so have Bitcoin ETFs. In general, digital currencies are mainstream with institutional investors. Many details are appealing about a cryptocurrency ETF—investors would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin more easily and eliminate the inconvenience of securing and storing Bitcoin.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "summary": "How blockchain ETFs work and the risks associated with such theme-based investments.\n\nBlockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies with blockchain technology-related operations or profit from the blockchain. Twenty-five blockchain ETFs trade on U.S. markets as of January 2024. Best known for underpinning cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology\u0027s decentralized structure has potential applications in health care and beyond. Blockchain ETFs are different from cryptocurrency ETFs, which are designed to track the price performance of one or more digital tokens.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain ETF?\n\nBlockchain exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold stocks of companies that profit from or have business operations tied to blockchain technology. Best known for its use in maintaining decentralized records of cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain technology has potential applications across many industries, with use cases as diverse as protecting healthcare data and managing video streaming services, among many others.\n\nAs the number of ETFs available on the market has grown, investors can target an increasing variety of market areas and asset types. Blockchain-based ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—are one way to invest in a diversified set of companies that may have cryptocurrency on their balance sheet or engage with blockchain technology in other parts of their business.\n\nTwenty-five blockchain ETFs provide U.S. investors with access to companies utilizing the technology as of January 2024.\n\nHow a Blockchain ETF Works\n\nBlockchain ETFs offer an efficient vehicle to invest in a select basket of blockchain-specific stocks. From an investor\u0027s perspective, these funds work just like any other ETF—you gain access to a group of stocks in the blockchain industry in a single instrument that trades on an exchange just like an individual stock.\n\nThe majority of U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs are passively managed, tracking the performance of an underlying index. For example, the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) aims to track the performance of a specially designed index called the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. This index includes companies involved in research, development, support, or utilization of blockchain technology and associated businesses.\n\nThe index methodology assigns a \"Blockchain Score\" to each potential company stock that may be an eligible candidate for inclusion. This score is based on several factors, such as how a company contributes to the blockchain ecosystem, its blockchain product maturity and associated economic impact, investments and expenditures on research and development activities, company results, and innovations.\n\nThe factor-based methodology ensures that the potential of a blockchain company and its business is gauged with higher accuracy for realistic economic profits, renovated business prospects, and operational competence. The 50 to 100 companies with the top Blockchain Scores qualify for entry into this index, and the same stocks get replicated in the BLCN ETF. The index is rebalanced every six months.\n\nSeveral blockchain ETFs opt for an active management strategy rather than relying on a custom-designed index like BLCN. With total assets over $1.1 billion as of January 2024, making it among the largest U.S.-traded blockchain ETFs, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) is one example of an actively managed fund.\n\nBLOK ETF issuer Amplify believes its active strategy allows its fund managers to \"make timely decisions and identify companies that are best positioned to profit from the developing blockchain technology space.\" The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its assets in stocks of companies deriving significant income from transformational data sharing-related business or engaged in the research and development, proof-of-concept testing, or implementation of similar technology.\n\nWhether they use active or passive strategies, blockchain ETFs often invest in companies from the banking and financial sector, technology, IT services, hardware, internet, telecom services, and even biotechnology firms that may be using some form of data sharing or blockchain-based systems.\n\nFor example, BLCN holds stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), and Beyond (BYON). BLOK includes MicroStrategy and Coinbase among its top holdings, along with Japan-based financial services group SBI Holdings (8473.T), Accenture (ACN), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nAs blockchain technology remains open and global, these ETFs include companies from around the globe. Regionally, both BLCN and BLOK have the bulk of exposure to North American-based blockchain companies, while the rest is shared by Asian and European companies in varying proportions.\n\nUse of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency\n\nBeyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is finding use in various other sectors. For one thing, the technology has extended its reach into other areas of the banking and financial markets. Financial institutions are using blockchain for international payments, equity swaps, cross-border trade, regulatory compliance, and protecting customer information.\n\nBut the potential uses of blockchain technology are not limited just to the financial world. The technology has potential in integrating health care data, tracking goods along the supply chain, and helping media companies protect their intellectual property. Even government systems involving voting and identity management could benefit from the blockchain\u0027s enhanced security and transparency.\n\nBlockchain ETF Risks\n\nBeing a theme-based investment, blockchain ETFs carry the inherent risk of non-performance, non-adaptability, or failure of the blockchain ecosystem. While there is an increasing level of acceptance for blockchain systems, the concept remains dependent on the evolution of the overall ecosystem, the reliability and stability of the blockchain network, its configuration, and its successful adoption.\n\nAnother inherent risk is that blockchain ETFs may end up investing in earlier-stage technology-based companies, which are prone to failure. While the diversification through ETFs mitigates such stock-specific risk to a reasonable extent, the risk of specific holdings not performing well remains.\n\nAdditionally, the holdings of blockchain ETFs often overlap with existing technology and internet companies. Companies included in the portfolio may derive a larger share of their revenues from non-blockchain-based products and services.\n\nFor instance, some blockchain ETF holdings might generate most of their revenues from networking equipment and computer processors, with a limited share of hardware used in blockchain-based systems. Blockchain segments may be contributing only a small part of overall revenues to such stocks, making the overall returns vulnerable to the non-performance of their majority non-blockchain segments.\n\nOne also needs to be aware of the expense ratio charged by funds and the trading charges levied by such ETF units. For example, BLCN and BLOK have expense ratios of 0.68% and 0.75%, respectively—significantly higher than a fund like the SPDR S\u0026P 500 ETF (SPY), which charges 0.09%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlockchain ETFs invest in a portfolio of companies with business activities related to the blockchain. This distributed database technology underpins cryptocurrency transactions and has many other applications. Some blockchain ETFs seek to track the performance of specialized indexes, while others are actively managed in an attempt to capitalize on the latest technological developments.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network. It is most noteworthy in its use with cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n\nBlockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger. In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\n\nGenerating random hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\n\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\n\nBlockchain can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency and financial system. They would have access to more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions with whom they can do domestic and international business.\n\nIllicit activity accounted for only 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2022.\n\n",
    "content": "What Is a Blockchain?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network\u0027s nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.\n\nBecause there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.\n\nSince Bitcoin\u0027s introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\n\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\n\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\n\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\n\nThe blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a block, like a cell in a spreadsheet containing information. Once it is full, the information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash.\n\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in the block. This creates a series of blocks that are chained together.\n\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.\n\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner or validator picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed and encrypted using an encryption algorithm. Then, the mining begins.\n\nThe entire network works simultaneously, trying to \"solve\" the hash. Each one generates a random hash except for the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\n\nEvery miner starts with a nonce of zero, which is appended to their randomly-generated hash. If that number isn\u0027t equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, and a new block hash is generated. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\n\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals about 60 minutes).\n\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin\u0027s process.\n\nBlockchain Decentralization\n\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.\n\nBecause of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s inventory.\n\nBlockchain Transparency\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.\n\nFor example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted are easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.\n\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\n\nIs Blockchain Secure?\n\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.\n\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block\u0027s hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would reject an altered block because the hashes would not match.\n\nFor instance, imagine that a hacker runs a node on a blockchain network and wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to change their copy, they would have to convince the other nodes that their copy was the valid one.\n\nThey would need to control a majority of the network to do this and insert it at just the right moment. This is known as a 51% attack because you need to control more than 50% of the network to attempt it.\n\nTiming would be everything in this type of attack—by the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast—the Bitcoin network hashed at 348.1 exahashes per second (18 zeros) on April 21, 2023.\n\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”The key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.\n\nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.\n\nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.\n\nThe nature of blockchain’s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country\u0027s citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.\n\nEach candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate for whom they wish to vote. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.\n\nBlockchain vs. Banks\n\nBlockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.\n\nTo see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.\n\nHow Are Blockchains Used?\n\nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, more than 23,000 other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.\n\nSome companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.\n\nWhy do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.\n\nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.\n\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.\n\nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\n\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Here are reviews of five of the best available books on blockchain, a relatively new, but rapidly growing and very important technology.\n\n\"Cryptoassets\" offers investors an introduction to blockchain, including basic concepts, a valuation framework, and practical details on getting started. \"Blockchain Revolution\" examines how blockchain technology might transform the ways we live and trade in the future. \"The Book of Satoshi\" helps readers to understand the blockchain from the perspective of its creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. \"The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains\" provides a comprehensive overview of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, serving as an excellent introduction for people new to the industry. \"The Blockchain Developer\" is a powerful resource for those interested in exploring the technical aspects of blockchain work to start new or continue existing projects.\n\nLike any new technology, understanding the financial implications of blockchain is often more useful to investors than learning technical details.\n\n",
    "content": "Innovative blockchain technology works without the need for a central authority. Blockchain is the underlying technological foundation of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dozens of leading financial firms, including Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM), are investing heavily in developing the technology. For people who want to learn more about blockchain technology and its applications, here are three of the best books on the subject.\n\n\u0027Cryptoassets\u0027 by Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar\n\nBurniske and Tatar look at blockchain from a financial perspective, but they also cover key technological concepts along the way. \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor\u0027s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond\" is written for investors rather than programmers or Bitcoin enthusiasts. That keeps most of their explanations relevant and comprehensible. Burniske and Tatar start with the origins of Bitcoin during the 2008 financial crisis and cover the basics. They also explain the crucial differences between Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology. The book then details the types of cryptoassets that have arisen, such as crypto tokens and crypto commodities.\n\nThis book also goes far beyond most of the literature by attempting to define cryptoassets as an asset class. There is even a chapter that takes on the difficult task of developing a valuation framework for cryptoassets. While the market is still too young for any framework to be definitive, Burniske and Tatar deserve praise for laying the necessary foundations. Finally, they also deal with the practical details of blockchain investing. Blockchain wallets, cryptocurrency exchanges, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are all covered.\n\n\u0027Blockchain Revolution\u0027 by Don and Alex Tapscott\n\nThe father-son team of Don and Alex Tapscott has written \"Blockchain Revolution\" to explain the impact of cryptocurrencies. The fully open platform of blockchain technology will expand and transform what we can do online, how we do it, and who can participate. According to the Tapscotts, blockchain technology will immensely improve the delivery of expanding financial services and the safeguarding of personal identity information. Blockchain also has benefits for business contracts and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe book also discusses the various ways that blockchain technology is changing the future of money, transactions, and business. Don Tapscott, also the author of \"Wikinomics,\" and his son, Alex, an expert on the blockchain, carefully explain the technology. They see it as a simple but transformative protocol that enables financial transactions to be both anonymous and secure through the distributed ledger. The authors recognize that blockchain technology is still in its infancy. They do an excellent job of separating what the technology can actually deliver now from its vast potential for the future.\n\n\u0027The Book of Satoshi\u0027 by Phil Champagne\n\nBlockchain technology and Bitcoin are linked because blockchain makes cryptocurrencies possible. This book offers the writings of the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. As of early 2024, the general public still did not know the true identity of Nakamoto.\n\nThe Nakamoto persona has only a virtual existence, much like its cryptocurrency creation. The persona is present only in the online publications Nakamoto offered to explain Bitcoin during the earliest days of its introduction. The Book of Satoshi is a definitive collection of Nakamoto\u0027s essential writings, including the original paper detailing the idea of Bitcoin. The book also contains Nakamoto\u0027s explanation of how Bitcoin works and a chronologically organized collection of Nakamoto\u0027s emails and online forum posts.\n\n\u0027The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains\u0027 by Antony Lewis\n\nAntony Lewis, formerly of early cryptocurrency exchange itBit, has been an expert in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces for nearly a decade. In this book, Lewis clearly and concisely breaks down the technical aspects of blockchain technology in a way that is digestible and understandable for those within and outside of the space. While this book also covers the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies as well, it is also a useful guide for those particularly interested in blockchain technology and its many applications.\n\n\u0027The Blockchain Developer\u0027 by Elad Elrom\n\nWhile other books on this list provide a general overview of blockchain technology, this book is written with developers in mind. As such, The Blockchain Developer does not shy away from technical discussion and granular, detailed information. After introducing the technology and its structure, author Elad Elrom discusses the process of creating your own blockchain, building dApps, and more. There are specialized sections of the book relating to popular existing blockchains for developers interested in creating apps for preexisting networks, as well as a portion of the book about blockchain applications outside of cryptocurrency.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain comes at a crucial time and may represent the savior of pension plans everywhere.\n\nPension plans are on their way out, and many of the ones that remain in place are threatened by insolvency. Blockchain technology can reduce the complicated layers of pension management and give pensioners more control over their money. By allowing the inclusion of cryptocurrency as a pension portfolio investment, blockchain is creating more accessible retirement plans that appeal to younger people, who are most in need of starting to save for their retirement.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, passed in March 2021, provides money to help multiemployer defined-benefit pension plans in the U.S. Many of these plans, which are typically for labor union members, were in serious danger of insolvency. The new law aims to put them on a firm financial footing through the year 2051.\n\nBlockchain technology provides greater transparency for and gets rid of excessive intermediaries in the pension-managing process.\n\n",
    "content": "Retirement represents a milestone for most adults, but despite the feelings of adventure and excitement that come with leaving the working world, this life stage must first be viewed through a financial lens. The ability to generate income with advancing age is limited, and no one wants to be a burden on their family or the state.\n\nThat said, there are Social Security programs and savings vehicles that are designed to help individuals prepare for their retirement years. One of these is the defined-benefit pension plan, which, unfortunately, is increasingly an endangered species.\n\nPensions Are in Trouble\n\nThey are a large reason why many can afford to leave their careers and take a well-deserved retirement, but pensions used to be more prominent. The days of working for one company and being rewarded with a guaranteed lifelong pension are over.\n\nAlthough pensions still exist, many of the companies that offer them have struggled to make good on the promises they made to their former employees, given harsh realities in the global economy. Trends such as the onset of automation and rising costs of modern medicine converge to put pressure on the bottom line while extending employers\u0027 obligations to former employees.\n\nMany retired people still rely on pensions, and their situation is becoming precarious due to the threats facing major pension funds around the world. Funds tasked with paying out monthly stipends are struggling to make good on their projected return promises, with many of them suffering from a lack of funding as obligations rise. The risks of default are great, not only to retirees but also to the whole economy.\n\nThere is a frightening gap between the amount of money in pension funds and their outstanding liabilities to pensioners, and it continues to grow. This deficit means that it’s only a matter of time before companies cannot afford to continue making pension payments, which could lead to a financial crisis that eclipses the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nGovernment pensions are also having difficulties: The U.S. Postal Service, for example, failed to deliver as much as $34 billion to its pension fund from 2012 through 2016.﻿﻿The biggest catalysts for this mess are a serious lack of transparency at all stages throughout the pension-managing process and changing legislative agendas. Those with the responsibility to pick a pension plan find it hard to understand where the fund is invested, how it performs, and if it can meet specific organizational needs. Accordingly, it’s nearly impossible to identify a fund that will act in good faith when it comes to timely and consistent payments.\n\nBlockchain to the Rescue\n\nBlockchain, a revolutionary computer-based record-keeping technology that functions as a digital ledger, comes at a crucial time and may represent the savior of pensions everywhere, thanks to the unique ways that it’s being applied by ambitious projects in the fledgling industry.\n\nAccording to Ana Andria, who founded Akropolis (as Anastasia O. Andrianova), a blockchain-powered pension infrastructure where she still serves as CEO, the world\u0027s pension system is failing for the following reasons:\"We are developing a blockchain protocol that helps solve these problems,\" says Andria, \"by creating a single, transparent global pensions system that increases pension-plan mobility, reduces friction, and incentivizes pension funds to act in consumers’ best interests.”Indeed, blockchain addresses these challenges by working on a shared decentralized ledger—which helps to align stakeholders in any single system—that provides access to crucial information relevant to all. This is particularly helpful with pensions, for which a simple, ledger-based system would let individuals audit the funds they’re considering. Blockchain also encourages greater accountability, with reporting mechanisms that can permanently punish funds that don’t follow through by inscribing results on the shared ledger.\n\nAkropolis, led by Andria, connects individuals, fund managers, and institutional finance in one greatly improved ecosystem. With an incentivized system for rating funds and financial entities based on their performance and behavior, cryptocurrency motivates the maintenance of a system where all aspects of a pension are out in the open. Accordingly, individuals responsible for picking retirement plans for their employees or themselves can see what a fund is invested in and, more important, how capable it is of building a sustainable financial future while honoring obligations.\n\nFewer Thumbs in the Pie\n\nSuch transparency is fundamental for a successful pension system. One of the most troublesome issues with pension infrastructure is that it’s overburdened with stakeholders. There are too many thumbs in the pie.\n\nBesides pensioners, there are account and fund managers, pension plan representatives, corporate boards and trustees, and others who have something to gain from influencing the process. Although they may not intentionally be sabotaging retirees’ variety of plan choices, they affect the results while the direct beneficiaries of pensions exercise little control. The blockchain ledger will eliminate unnecessary intermediaries and provide transparency, greater choice, and direct responsibility for pensioners to pick the investments that are best for them—and them only.\n\nExciting Millennials with Cryptocurrency\n\nBlockchain can solve another problem as well. Efforts by working individuals to save for retirement have been waning, largely due to stagnant wages, rising inflation, and debt levels. Millennials are neglecting to look over the financial horizon for fear of what they’ll see, but blockchain adds optimism to the picture.\n\nWith trends showing that less than 66% of Millennials have saved anything for their eventual retirement, the future looks grim.﻿﻿ However, blockchain is creating more-accessible retirement plans that include cryptocurrency investments in addition to traditional financial assets. These appeal to a younger crowd that is in urgent need of starting to save for retirement.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPensions are colossal sums of money that require immense supervision, management, and input. Blockchain is already showing the world how it will solve their most enduring problems. With greater transparency and the lower costs that come with more convenient ways to address fund management, stakeholders in the pension system can finally move closer together and align their interests.\n\n",

    "title": "The GPU Industry Is Booming Thanks to Blockchain\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain allows the GPU industry to revolutionize its sales model, deprioritizing retail sales and creating massive networks to unleash rendering power.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin hit the headlines at the end of 2020 after breaking its all-time record price and surpassing the $20K mark. But the price has continued to break records, and the cryptocurrency was trading at around $50,000 at the beginning of March 2021.﻿﻿There have been many beneficiaries of the cryptocurrency gold rush of the past few years, and one is the graphics processing unit (GPU) industry. As a vital component for mining computers to efficiently solve hashing algorithms, GPUs have become a premium commodity, leading to a scarcity in supply and a spike in prices for even lower-tier graphics cards.\n\nThis has created a complex situation that has left many sectors without access to technology vital for their work. In addition, consumers have seen supply shortages and heavily distorted prices. Even so, the market is booming, and blockchain is largely to thank. Without GPUs, it would be significantly harder and take substantially longer to mine coins. However, the relationship seems to be a two-way street. Now, new blockchain applications are offering new use cases that could continue driving GPU prices higher while simultaneously sustaining demand at current levels.\n\nThe introduction of computing power as a service, and especially on the blockchain, is redefining computer usage. With blockchain’s ability to incentivize participation, companies that offer GPU-as-a-service are encouraging users to create GPU pools that can be monetized or convert their mining rigs as they replace GPUs with ASIC mining tools. Whatever the case, the GPU will continue its upward trajectory, propelled by blockchain.\n\nA Growing Problem\n\nThe cryptocurrency boom has made mining an incredibly profitable endeavor, even as the difficulty of mining continues to increase exponentially. What was once possible with a single computer now requires large operations with hundreds of computers networked and pooling processing power to solve hashes more effectively. Additionally, regular CPUs do not have the dedicated memory capacity to process hashing algorithms quickly enough. GPUs, on the other hand, have built-in dedicated memory that makes them ideal for mining.\n\nThe need for bigger and faster mining computers has created a serious problem in the GPU and computer components markets as miners rush to purchase every available GPU as quickly as they can. Prices have skyrocketed for even lower-tier graphics cards, and many stores and retailers have even had to establish measures to prevent single users from buying out their supply.﻿﻿ Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 had a suggested price of $690 in Jan. 2021, and Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070Ti, for example, is out of stock. Similar mass shortages have affected retail users and even academia, where scientists require heavy processing power for advanced studies such as astronomy, genetics, and mathematics.﻿﻿The industry also sees no end to the status quo. Industry experts predict GPU prices will continue to rise, and business is booming for major GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia.\n\nIn Feb. 2021, Nvidia showed record quarterly revenue helped by the COVID-19 epidemic that fueled demand for its products. The GPU market is expected to continue growing for the foreseeable future. The global GPU market size was valued at $19.75 billion in 2019, and is expected to reach $200.85 billion by 2027, a growth rate of over 33% from 2020 to 2027 as GPUs are becoming valuable to blockchain.﻿﻿Outside of mining, blockchain and GPU represent an ideal coupling. The former’s distributed networks offer users a new way to conceive of computing power, leveraging the sum total of its users to create \"virtual supercomputers\" that rely on the collective power of the network. Moreover, there is an increasing demand for computing-as-a-service, evidenced by the growing popularity of cloud computing and the GPU-as-a-service market.\n\nSeveral tech giants already offer these services, though they remain fully centralized, and thus somewhat inefficient. Google Cloud offers GPU services, as does Amazon Web Services, and even Nvidia has started delivering solutions.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Now, several blockchain-based platforms are ready to compete by employing a model that relies less upon central control by focusing instead on more democratized networks.\n\nOnline rendering firm Leonardo Render, for example, is already planning big things using blockchain. The company offers real-time rendering services by leveraging its network’s GPU power to offer users fast and low-cost tools. The company already counts upon 23,000 GPUs thanks to its partnership with GPU hosting giant Giga-Watt, in an effort to help creatives and agencies scale their graphic turnover.﻿﻿Similarly, Golem uses blockchain to combine its users’ spare computing power to create a virtual supercomputer. The company plans to make it accessible to all, though it is still in initial phases, so its impact on the market has not yet been grasped.﻿﻿ Others like OTOY are converting their services to the blockchain to continue enhancing their offerings.﻿﻿GPUs For Cyptocurrency Miners\n\nIn January of 2021, the CFO of Nvidia suggested that the company was considering restarting the production of dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs) for cryptocurrency miners, which are called CMPs. CMPS are GPUs without video output, so they are cheaper to produce. Although cryptocurrency mining is not expected to be a major source of demand for Nvidia\u0027 products, the gaming sector is, and restarting CMPs would allow the company to meet the demand for gaming GPUs.﻿﻿A Future Boom\n\nAs the price of physical components continues to soar—something that seems likely as mining remains as popular as ever—more regular users will be faced with the need to access GPU computing power with no physical solution.\n\nBlockchain allows the GPU industry to collectively revolutionize its sales model, deprioritizing retail sales and creating massive networks that users and companies can leverage to unleash unparalleled processing and power. As GPUs are replaced by components like ASICs, used for bitcoin mining, the flood of used components may even make it profitable to continue using them for a different, albeit blockchain-related, network.\n\n",

    "title": "Passwords Are Obsolete, Get With the Blockchain\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology could provide a better alternative to memorizing long, confusing, and easily forgotten passwords.\n\n",
    "content": "Before checking your email, Instagram, or bank account, the one thing that you likely do first is enter your password. This amounts to little more than muscle memory because most people have already absorbed their passwords into their brains just as they do a relative’s birthday or their favorite athlete’s scoring statistics.\n\nFor any number of reasons, when it comes to their devices, many people choose not to use passwords at all, either because they think they have nothing valuable on their computers or because in their eyes, a hack is unlikely. Others justify a bare minimum password, which could mean setting their laptop’s start screen credentials to \"123456,\" reusing an old login, or doing so with minor alterations.\n\nThis type of negligence might not have borne consequences yet, but is quite dangerous to leave unaddressed. Ask yourself a simple question: how similar is that password to the one protecting your truly treasured materials? Unfortunately, the answer is usually that they’re almost identical.\n\nHumans have a hard time remembering strong passwords for each of their favorite applications, platforms, and accounts, so if they aren’t identical, then they’re often quite similar. Few have the memory required to contain tens of long-tail phrases, and this represents an immense security risk as computing technology gets more powerful. Thankfully, one of blockchain’s most pertinent uses will render these concepts obsolete.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Passwords?\n\nTaking a strong password and altering it slightly isn’t a bad deterrent for humans trying to break into your device, but it’s not humans doing the breaching. Using passwords requires that we remember them, which automatically means that they’re simple enough for most computers to guess, given enough time. (See also: Can Bitcoin Be Hacked?)Computers and their powerful algorithms can use brute-force tactics to guess thousands of potential letter and number combinations in seconds, so it doesn’t matter how clever you think your password is. However, an easily guessed password represents the lowest-hanging fruit for most fraudsters. There are many other ways they can get their hands on it, and from there, access to the rest of your accounts and assets.\n\nPhishing emails are designed to look like those sent by legitimate institutions, and might prompt you to “change” your password, or install keylogging software that spies on the keys you press. Regardless of how they go about it, all these methods are designed to capture your password and then discover a bread crumb trail to your other sensitive information. This is a threat to individuals, surely, but for enterprise companies which still use passwords for work terminals, the risk is even greater. (See also: What Is a \"Phishing Scam\" and How Can They Be Avoided?)When it comes down to it, the real problem with passwords is that they still exist. However, there were few alternatives available until blockchain began to show signs of maturity a short time ago. (See also: Cyber Wars: How The U.S. Stock Market Could Get Hacked.)Credentials Courtesy of Blockchain\n\nBlockchain is now spreading through the technology mainstream like wildfire, with developers and businesspeople alike in wonder over its powerful, decentralized methodology. One of the first proposed applications of blockchain was to create something called a self-sovereign ID, which employs cryptography and network cohesion to change how people identify themselves online.\n\nThe bottom-most layer of blockchain is the public ledger which records all transactions of data on its network and shares it in real-time between active nodes. However, there is no central authority to organize it. Instead, algorithmic consensus determines the veracity of transactions and their order on the ledger, creating a type of shared authority over what happens on the network.\n\nAdditionally, blockchain employs the highest standards of cryptography to create a layer between one’s public blockchain address and their real identity. A user is assigned one single private ID, which is paired to the public ID that represents themselves on the chain.\n\nWhen they receive data, in the form of a cryptocurrency trade or message, for example, the recipient must use their private ID to access it. This dual-layered defense means that hackers are without a way to corrupt the network—thanks to decentralization—but also without a method of tying identifying information to any single transaction or account.\n\nPutting Next-Generation Passwords Through Their Paces\n\nBlockchain startups are already hard at work to put the idea of self-sovereign ID into practice, helping make passwords a thing of the past. Companies like SelfKey are using this new authentication paradigm to offer citizens in any country a standardized way to apply for and verify important documents across borders. Other companies like LastPass, which stores encrypted passwords in private accounts, have been attracting users in the last few years.\n\nApplying for passports, opening a bank account, starting a charity and other common processes are more easily managed when an individual owns their own digital ID, and can use it freely and safely no matter how disparate the components of their livelihood.\n\nREMME is a next-generation access protection -- and whose token sale reached its hard cap of $20 million in February -- distills the most important ideas of blockchain into a streamlined application that has a single, powerful purpose: the ability to log in to any service more securely, especially because passwords aren’t involved. Instead, the REMME blockchain stores a user’s unique device certificates on its decentralized network, so that when they want to log in to a web property or application, they simply need to click the REMME button to login. The application checks the ledger to verify that the correct device certificate is pinging for entry, and immediately grants entry into the account.\n\nTwo-factor authentication strengthens the deal, so if a user conceivably wants to get into their bank account, for example, they’d need to press the button on their bank’s page but also confirm from their phone. Such a service is leagues ahead of current-generation password managers like LastPass or NoPassword, and is already gaining notoriety in the marketplace.\n\nThese are some of the most evolved examples available of how blockchain is revolutionizing the idea of digital credentials. No longer will users need to reconcile their own memory with their safety, and neither will they entrust their login information to centralized authorities. What results is a more secure technique for managing our digital existence, and a simple product that combats existing exploits in a streamlined package. With these kinds of solutions on the horizon, it’s only a matter of time before hacks like the one perpetrated against Equifax’s servers last year exist only in the dustbin of history.

Find Out If the Equifax Breach Affects You.)Investing in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain-based solutions could disrupt the mortgage industry by eliminating many of the inefficiencies that plague the mortgage industry.\n\n",
    "content": "Despite the major buzz blockchain is causing across several industries, and especially within the financial services sector, it seems that mortgages have surprisingly been insulated from the disruption. However, this is quickly changing. The appeal of blockchain to financial institutions is quite clear—the ability to disintermediate and reduce the friction inherent in interactions between consumers and banks such as loans is hard to resist.\n\nEven so, the real estate lending industry remains firmly entrenched in a system that raises the cost of transactions significantly. This is slowly changing as blockchain’s influence seeps into the sector, introducing new products and platforms that threaten the status quo and could significantly change the way mortgages operate.\n\nDecentralized technology offers several advantages over the current model, but they are predicated largely on adoption rates and scalability. Should blockchain technology overcome these challenges and find a real niche in the industry, the mortgage game could look very different in a few years.\n\nIntermediaries and Bank Walls\n\nOne of the current issues facing the institutional lending industry is the complexity of the loan process. While the financial technology sector has made strong inroads in streamlining processes, the fact remains that for most institutional lenders approving a potential borrower is a process that often takes weeks, if not months.\n\nThe largest culprit is the fact that at each step of the loan process, there is an intermediary who slows down the mortgage’s eventual approval. In the US, each mortgage application must go through financial services, realtors, lawyers, and more in the time between accepting an offer and closing a sale. Each of these steps includes fees and adds days to an already long process. All told, mortgages in the US can take up to two full months to be approved.\n\nThe second problem is trust. One of the largest sources of delays in mortgage applications are the errors in the paper-based documentation. The other side of the table is not blameless, however.\n\nA large part of the problem leading up to the 2008 financial crisis was the wild-west-style secondary mortgage market and the fact that many bank approval processes remain murky at best and completely opaque at worst. The result was much tighter oversight and increased costs for users.\n\nWhat Blockchain Brings to the Table\n\nWhile blockchain doesn’t offer a perfect remedy to the problems afflicting the industry, it does provide a model that minimizes some of them. The first major improvement the technology brings is transparency. Blockchain’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) provides two major upgrades to the current model—it decentralizes the storage of information, and it makes all transactions immediately available across all nodes of the chain. The first upgrade means that companies and lenders can no longer manipulate information or engage in shadowy practices with data, as it is shared across an entire network and not under their exclusive supervision.\n\nThe second and more immediately important upgrade means that all transactions become public record in a ledger that is updated simultaneously and cannot be manipulated. Companies like Viva Network, which offers a decentralized crowd-lending platform, promise to remove intermediaries and create a more open home loan marketplace. These platforms rely on the power of ledger technology to create a system based on accountability and the inability to cheat thanks to smart contracts. This, in turn, reduces much of the friction present in mortgage applications.\n\nThe other major aspect blockchain can help with is disintermediation. Currently, the mortgage approval process can cost thousands of dollars before a single dime is paid towards the loan itself. From legal fees to underwriting costs, home buyers must jump through several costly hoops before being having their applications approved. Blockchain can also remove the intermediaries in centralized systems such as those in-between banks and mortgage lenders.\n\nCompanies like Synechron focus on providing better value across the lending process, simplifying the process for both sides thanks to limited automation. However, these solutions, while effective at expediting the process, don’t deal with the root cause—a heavily layered process. Companies like Homelend are going all-in on technology-based solutions that revolve around blockchain. The company’s P2P network connects lenders and borrowers directly, removing many of the steps involved in the process—legal, underwriting, and more—and replaces them with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. The length of the pre-qualification and approval process can be cut by nearly half.\n\n\"The mortgage value chain has grown in complexity during the past three decades, due to the trend towards securitization, which has significantly amplified financial supply. Nevertheless, mortgage lending processes remain mostly paper-based and involve many players, making them complicated, tedious and slow. This has several negative consequences for the borrower as well as for other parties involved,\" reads the company\u0027s white paper.\n\nReaching Critical Mass\n\nThese blockchain-based solutions have real potential for disruption and could eliminate many of the inefficiencies that plague the mortgage industry. However, the tools are still in their relative infancy, and their adoption remains the largest concern. If they can prove their worth, however, blockchain could quickly create a significantly more efficient, transparent, and faster model for home lending and buying.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain enthusiasts have many different education projects to look forward to.\n\n",
    "content": "Cryptocurrencies remain a trendy topic in the investment world, but for many, blockchain is where it\u0027s really at. Investors tired of the volatility of digital tokens, the concerns about fraud and security, and speculation about bubbles and scams have a related but separate area in which to focus their attention and investments.\n\nBlockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ripple, has been hailed as one of the greatest inventions in recent history (and even, depending upon who you ask, as one of the top creations of all time). It is, undoubtedly, an exciting moment to be a blockchain enthusiast; interest in the space has spread far and wide, and there are countless projects aiming to do nothing short of revolutionize and disrupt whole industries.\n\nThe biggest question for many investors is no longer about whether or not blockchain will catch on. Now, it has to do with which projects are most likely to succeed in these goals. A recent report by CryptoDaily highlights the answers that HowToToken co-founder Kirill Shilov suggests for this question, particularly with regard to the education world.\n\nEdgeCoin\n\nShilov focuses on projects that can revolutionize data and the way the education system works. One of the projects he highlights is EdgeCoin. This blockchain project allows for the storage of research materials and certificates, helping to cut costs within the industry and streamline academia. Shilov explains that \"EdgeCoin uses proof of scale (PoS) rather than the standard proof of work (PoW). PoS is where only a select few of those nodes are chosen ... by choosing a select few individuals to govern the site, the transmission of smart contracts goes much faster.\"SuccessLife\n\nShilov points to SuccessLife as a model for how educational services can be made more accessible thanks to blockchain. Shilov shares that \"the multi-chain architecture of the blockchain supports data sharing, time-stamping, and encrypted archiving, making it better suited to support content management for ongoing marketplace development.\" SuccessLife capitalizes on these attributes by providing lower-cost educational services.\n\nTutellus\n\nAnother education-related project that Shilov recommends is Tutellus. This project provides a platform containing more than 120,000 video courses. Users receive rewards for completing courses and demonstrating comprehension. Shilov explains that \"Tutellus has more than a million viewers, so you\u0027d think the website would need a super fast platform to accommodate that much traffic.\" Blockchain technology has helped Tutellus not only to incentivize its education system for users, but also to streamline the process of transmission for students.\n\nSonyGlobalEducation\n\nA fourth project Shilov suggests keeping an eye on in the blockchain education realm is SonyGlobalEducation. A program of the Sony Corp., SonyGlobalEducation is a blockchain-based educational record system. Records are an area of the academic world largely beholden to outdated technologies, and SonyGlobalEducation aims to allow students to quickly update and access their records. The platform also purports to offer learners access to a wide variety of educational providers, in addition to its blockchain-based record storage and transmission systems.\n\nWill education-related projects be the next big thing in the blockchain space? It\u0027s difficult to say, as there are individuals and companies looking to harness this technology to upend hundreds of different existing industries. Nonetheless, blockchain could help to make the world of education more efficient and cost-effective as it opens up access to educational programs to more and more individuals around the world.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

    "summary": "ETFs tracking trendy areas of technological innovation are especially popular.\n\nInvestors who want to focus on promising sectors such as AI, blockchain, or robotics but don\u0027t want to pick individual stocks frequently turn to ETFs that target these technologies. AI, blockchain, and robotics ETFs are likely to charge higher fees than ETFs that invest more broadly, given the need for more specialized management, rebalancing costs, and due diligence research. As these technologies are always evolving, investors should regularly review the holdings of their ETFs to ensure they still fit their investment strategies.\n\nInvesting in emerging technology ETFs for robotics, AI, and blockchain offers high-growth potential and risks. These fields can be volatile and should fit your broader investment strategies.\n\nA blockchain ETF invests in the shares of companies with business exposure to blockchain technology, such as software companies. This is different from crypto ETFs, which invest in digital currencies.\n\n",
    "content": "Some of the most popular new investments focus on advanced technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and robotics.\n\nIn the fast-evolving tech sectors, AI, blockchain, and robotics are on the shortlist of those most likely to be widely transformative this decade. Blockchain has been called by some a breakthrough technology as important as the internet. Robotics offer the potential for greater efficiencies that come with increased automation, while artificial intelligence occupies a similar space.\n\nEnter thematic ETFs, which are investments that target these sectors.\n\nThematic ETFs Present Long-Term Opportunities\n\nWhy are ETFs focused on AI, blockchain, and robotics drawing so much interest from investors, given their narrow focus and they often have higher fees than traditional ETFs?For starters, there\u0027s the novelty. AI, blockchain, and robotics are still relatively new and create far more headlines than most other sectors. Many investors are also simply optimistic about these new industries and want the kind of profits seen by previous generations from their participation in the rise of computing, the internet, and social media.\n\nInvestors are generally bullish on new technologies because AI, blockchain, and robotics are expected to grow significantly well into the future.\n\nHere are ways investing in these ETFs—a type of exchange-traded product (ETP)—could have long-term potential:By investing in AI, blockchain, and robotics-focused ETFs, you are not just expecting good performance from companies producing these technologies. You are also making a wager on your expectation that AI, blockchain, or robotics will be widely adopted across the economy. Here are the ETFs making a similar wager:While none of these technologies have yet truly transformed the business world (or the world at large), these thematic ETFs offer a basket of assets with both exposure and diversification within these fields, each of which has a compelling case that could make it part of long-term trends in the economy.\n\nLong-Term Investors Should Not Be Complacent\n\nLong-term investors in ETFs (whatever their focus) should ensure they keep up to date with their ETFs\u0027 investments. If your ETF is overexposed in one sector or trends are changing, you could balance your risk with other assets. Just because an ETF may be passively managed does not necessarily mean you should treat your investment passively.\n\nThis advice applies to index ETFs just as much as it does ETFs representing new areas such as AI, blockchain, and robotics. Indeed, because these fields constantly evolve, you perhaps need to be even more vigilant.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNew technologies are famously disruptive to the status quo, and thematic ETFs focused on AI, blockchain, and robotics can expose you to fields expected to offer long-term growth and disruption to many industries. ETFs that target their exposure to companies driving or profiting from advances in AI, blockchain, or robotics have shares in firms that cross sectors from healthcare and automotive to consumer goods.\n\nWhile they offer the potential for high returns, it\u0027s important to use caution and consider their fit within your broader portfolio, given the risks. Whether you\u0027re a seasoned investor or new and looking not to miss out on investing in this generation\u0027s major changes, thematic ETFs offer the ability to diversify within these niches.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain is touted as a trustless environment that eliminates third parties. Is that really true?\n\n",
    "content": "One of the primary advantages of blockchain, the thinking goes, is that it creates trustless relationships in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Before cryptocurrencies, digital transactions between two parties required a trusted third party to act as an intermediary. Given that blockchain is a public, anonymous, immutable digital ledger, many supporters argue that it will help to usher in a new mode of conducting transactions that are not dependent on intermediaries at all. However, a report by Coinspeaker suggests that this is not likely to be the case.﻿﻿ Below, we\u0027ll explore why blockchain doesn\u0027t eliminate third-party intermediaries and why it likely never will.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Achieves\n\nBefore exploring the need for intermediaries, it\u0027s worth noting what a network like bitcoin does achieve in its efforts to do away with third parties. Bitcoin is a financial network with no privilege levels, meaning that all changes to the ledger are managed mutually by all users. The benefit for the bitcoin user is that they don\u0027t have to trust anyone outside of the ecosystem to validate transactions taking place within it because every participant is also a validator. This means that bitcoin users take on some additional risk themselves: for instance, if an investor loses a private key to a wallet, there is no third party to whom that investor can petition for a new password.\n\nWhat Remains for Intermediaries to Accomplish\n\nBlockchain is able to do away with intermediaries within the bitcoin ecosystem as illustrated above. So long as users are transacting only in bitcoin and only within the given ecosystem, there is no need for external validation of operations. However, what blockchain does not do is allow for integration with the external world. As the report suggests, \"with or without blockchain, national registries will always require intermediaries that put the data in … with or without blockchain, the digital ownership platform will always require middlemen that would verify your identity.\"﻿﻿ To put it another way, when a blockchain network needs to interact with other databases, with other aspects of the external world, it typically requires a go-between of some kind.\n\nBlockchain can help to make the process of intermediation more efficient. It can even help to minimize the trust required of ecosystem participants of these intermediaries in any number of ways. However, it\u0027s unlikely that intermediaries will ever disappear completely.\n\nAutomatization\n\nWhat blockchain technology does help to facilitate, though, is automation. This technology allows for data reconciliation between independent parties who, in many cases, don\u0027t even need to trust each other. In this way, and because blockchain can synchronize data across an unlimited number of servers in real-time, many of the processes from auditing to database management can potentially be made vastly more efficient. Processes like inspections and data transfers will be able to take place automatically and efficiently.\n\nTake the process of auditing as an example. Blockchain can help to synchronize data, inspect database updates, and so on. What it will not be able to do, though, and why an intermediary will still be required, is to address issues relating to identity. Auditors must still make sure that their clients are \"actual people with reasonable intentions that come to their office to have some activities certified,\" according to the report.\n\nPermissionless blockchain ecosystems like bitcoin do indeed exclude intermediaries within those systems. However, there are many areas (national registries, voting systems, trading platforms, and so on) that will likely continue to require third parties. Blockchain can help reduce the role of these intermediaries and to alter the trust relationships previously required, but it is unlikely to ever do away with them entirely.\n\n",

    "summary": "While blockchain offers advances in encryption and security, it\u0027s vulnerable in some of the same ways as other technologies and has unique risks.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, has enormous promise but also major security vulnerabilities that could lead to billions of dollars in losses. Chief among these vulnerabilities are the very advantages touted among blockchain proponents: transparency, distributed control and anonymity.\n\nStuart Madnick, a professor of information technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management, studied 72 cases of blockchain system security breaches from 2011 to 2018 totaling $1 billion. Some of the cases were small losses of about $12,000, but others cost companies as much as $600 million.﻿﻿Common among the cases were the attack vectors. Criminals have used blockchain\u0027s features such transparency, distributed control and anonymity to steal millions.\n\n\"The bottom line is that while the blockchain system represents advances in encryption and security, it is vulnerable in some of the same ways as other technology, as well as having new vulnerabilities unique to blockchain,\" Madnick says.﻿﻿Distributed Ledger Technology Far from ‘Unbreakable’\n\nProponents of the distributed ledger technology tout its transparency, distributed control and anonymity. That being said, while blockchain offers advances in encryption and security, there are many issues with the technology, which is far from \"unbreakable.\"While Madnick examined 72 publicly reported security breaches, he says there are likely more, as many cyber attacks are not publicly reported.\n\n\"Blockchain may be its own worst enemy, as many of the things that make it so great also increase its vulnerability when it comes to security,\" Madnick says. \"Three examples include transparency, distributed control and anonymity.\"﻿﻿As for transparency, given the blockchain ledger and software code is copied on many servers and viewable by many, it leaves room for a criminal to access and study the code for weaknesses. The distributed nature of the technology, for which there is no on/off switch from a central computer, means it is difficult to stop an intruder from siphoning away money if a vulnerability is found.\n\nAdditionally, the anonymity offered to blockchain users, who receive a \"blockchain key\" comprised of long numbers, poses a threat. Although the number is impossible to guess and therefore has security benefits, Madnick noted there is \"no override capability on your blockchain account.\" Therefore, if you lose your key, you lose your funds. Madnick pointed to the case of a CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange who mysteriously died, taking millions of customers funds with him to the grave.﻿﻿Looking Ahead\n\nThough Madnick highlights known issues with blockchain, the technology\u0027s champions remain confident blockchain will prove itself in the long-run, revolutionizing the tech world much like the internet did beginning in the 1990s. And as potential vulnerabilities become more commonly known, steps can be taken to mitigate them.\n\n",

Now that piece of history has been recorded for posterity on Ethereum. (See also: Why North Korea and South Korea Are Separated).\n\nAccording to a report on Coindesk Korea, two electronic versions – one in English and another in Korean - of the Panmunjom Declaration signed at the summit are now stored on Ethereum’s blockchain. Ryu Gi-hyeok, who was responsible for coding the declaration, told the publication that this was his contribution to the historic achievement. “I just thought it took too long for the South and the North to give way to each other… After finding out what I could contribute to this historic achievement as a developer, I found the Panmunjom Declaration on the Blue House homepage and recorded it on ethereum,\" he said, adding that he has plans to launch a website that will keep “all historic records immutable and permanent” on a blockchain.\n\nBlockchain as a Ledger of Historical Record\n\nGi-hyoek’s intentions for blockchain are a demonstration of blockchain’s utility as a ledger of historical record. The first block ever mined in bitcoin is known as the Genesis record and records the Bank of England’s announcement of a bailout, a consequence of the financial crisis, the effects of which are still reverberating across the world. According to some accounts, blockchain heralds the advent of an “Internet of Value” in which transactions will occur due to an exchange of value between systems and parties. Much of that value resides in information and records of important documents encoded and stored on blockchain. For example, Dubai’s blockchain strategy consists of transferring all government records and documents onto blockchain for future transactions. (See also: Can Decentralized, Blockchain Internet Become A Reality?)As the Coindesk article points out, the encoding of the Korean declaration is the second such instance in recent times. The #MeToo awakening, which has brought sexual harassment of women in workplaces to light, used Ethereum’s blockchain to evade censorship in China. A Peking University student, who petitioned for the reopening of a case that she alleged was related to sexual harassment, had her letter censored by Chinese authorities. After a failed social media campaign to bring light to the issue, the student\u0027s letter has been encoded on Ethereum’s blockchain for good.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

    "summary": "Bitcoin is volatile, but blockchain investments are not perfect either.\n\n",
    "content": "Digital currencies, including bitcoin, have become synonymous with volatility. Elevated volatility among cryptocurrencies and the lack of a trusted global regulatory framework are among the reasons some market observers back blockchain investments as a way of tapping the digital currency space over the currencies themselves. Still, there are those that advise caution with blockchain as well. Blockchain is intended to be a centralized ledger of digital currency transactions.\n\nCryptocurrency \"prices rallied significantly in 2017, bringing the total market capitalization to nearly $500 billion,\" said BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) in a note out Tuesday. \"But we don\u0027t see them becoming part of mainstream investment portfolios soon. Crypto markets are highly volatile, fragmented, largely unregulated, and come with unique liquidity and operational risks.\" (See also: The Black Swan Risk In Cryptocurrency Markets.)BlackRock is the parent company of iShares, the world\u0027s largest issuer of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company has previously said that it is not interested in launching a bitcoin ETF. As BlackRock notes, bitcoin and rivals like ethereum and ripple are significantly more volatile than U.S. stocks, and that includes the performance of U.S. stocks during the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis.\n\n\"Cautious on bitcoin and bullish on the underlying blockchain technology – this is an emerging consensus among policymakers and business leaders,\" said the asset manager. \"Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, enables secure peer-to-peer transactions. This means no intermediaries, but also no trusted centralized authority.\"Today, there are four blockchain ETFs trading in the U.S., all of which have come to market this year. The first two – the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and the Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) – debuted on the same day in mid-January. BLOK and BLCN have about $287 million in combined assets under management. Overall, the four blockchain ETFs, none of which can actually have the term blockchain in their names, have just over $300 million in combined assets under management. (For more, see: What Is the Difference Between Blockchain ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs?)Obviously, the marriage of blockchain and ETFs is still in the honeymoon stages, but BLK and BLCN prove that there is appetite for the concept. However, risks linger, and investors should consider those issues. \"Yet challenges abound. Take the financial industry,\" said BlackRock. \"A blockchain-based, single shared financial database could eliminate inefficiencies and risks associated with human processes, but adoption at scale would require a massive shift in software development and a well-constructed maintenance model. Regulators and central bankers would also need to play a big role, we believe.\" (For additional reading, check out: Top Blockchain Startups to Watch in 2018.)",

    "content": "The Hong Kong affiliate of cryptocurrency exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global, has for the second time withdrawn its application for a licence to operate a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) in the city, forcing it to close operations as required by the city’s regulations.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has removed HBGL Hong Kong Limited from a list of cryptocurrency exchange licence applicants on Tuesday after the firm withdrew the application for its platform Huobi HK, according to the SFC website.\n\nHBGL first submitted its application on February 20 before withdrawing on February 23. The company then resubmitted an application on February 26, only a few days before Hong Kong’s February 29 deadline for crypto exchanges hoping to operate legally in the city.\n\nHuobi HK has not publicly disclosed the reason for its latest withdrawal, or whether it was instructed by the SFC to do so. In either case, HBGL must cease operating its exchange in the city within three months.\n\nUnder Hong Kong’s new virtual asset regime, the SFC may send a notice to a firm if it does not qualify for a so-called deeming arrangement, in which the platform is deemed to be licensed from June 1 while it awaits full approval for a licence. Businesses that fail to qualify are required to shut down by May 31 or within three months of being notified by the SFC, whichever is later.\n\nHBGL did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nHTX, founded in Beijing in 2013, is the world’s sixth-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume, according to data from market tracker CoinGecko.\n\nHTX first announced its plans to pursue a licence in Hong Kong in February last year through a statement its adviser Justin Sun posted on Twitter, now X.\n\nThe company has since declared publicly that HBGL, which was pursuing the licence for Huobi HK, is “independently managed and operated” and is not involved in HTX’s management and operation.\n\nHTX is the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange started in mainland China to be thwarted in its bid to obtain a Hong Kong licence under a new scheme that has proven to be costly and have onerous compliance requirements.\n\nHKVAEX, which the Post reported last year is a local firm backed by the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, also withdrew its Hong Kong licence application last month. It announced that it was shutting down just three months after submitting its application.\n\nThere are now 20 applicants for Hong Kong’s VATP licence, with OKX, Crypto.com, Bybit and Bullish among the largest.\n\n",

    "content": "Police in China’s northeastern Jilin province have arrested six people in connection with a money-laundering case involving the movement of 2.14 billion yuan (US$296 million) in cryptocurrency to South Korea.\n\nJin and Shen, the surnames of two suspects, allegedly carried out an illegal currency exchange business, according to a statement issued by police in the city of Panshi, the state-run China News Service reported on Friday.\n\nSome people were defrauded out of their money, according to police, who did not identify which cryptocurrencies were used in the scheme.\n\nLaw enforcement became aware of the scheme when bank accounts under the suspects’ names showed “large [daily] transactions” involving a “large number of customers”. The activity had the characteristics of an illegal underground bank, according to police.\n\nPolice said the criminal group used mainland China bank accounts to receive funds, which were then used to buy cryptocurrency at over-the-counter exchanges. The crypto could then be used to facilitate foreign money exchange for cross-border business, such as e-commerce firms and other import and export businesses.\n\nMainland China maintains a strict ban on commercial cryptocurrency activity, as Beijing has long regarded it as a threat to financial stability. The central government also has strict foreign exchange controls over capital flight concerns.\n\nIn 2021, the People’s Bank of China warned that crypto firms facilitating trading activity in China were breaking the law. The government also initiated a sweeping campaign that year to push bitcoin mining out of the country.\n\nMany companies in the industry have since moved much of their remaining operations out of mainland China. Exchanges also ostensibly stopped serving mainland users, although some like Binance have maintained easy workarounds that are widely shared online.\n\nWith the crypto trade among private individuals remaining a legal grey area, mainland China saw US$86.4 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions from July 2022 to June 2023 – most of which took place through over-the-counter channels or grey market, peer-to-peer services, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has increased its efforts in combating cryptocurrency-related money laundering. Last December, China’s prosecutors and forex regulators released a statement pledging to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal foreign exchange trading, with a particular focus on cases involving Tether.\n\nThe government is also seeking to revise its Anti-Money-Laundering Law to address risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nThe revised draft was under review in late April by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislative body when the full congress is not in session.\n\nIn 2022, police in the northern Inner Mongolia autonomous region arrested 63 individuals in connection with the laundering of 12 billion yuan through the use of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the overall volume of money in crypto-related money laundering cases has recently decreased. Illicit addresses sent US$22.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2023, a 29 per cent decline from the US$31.5 billion sent in 2022, according to Chainalysis. “Both legitimate and illicit” trading activity saw an “overall decrease” in that period, the firm said.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "‘Art became an auto-generated aesthetic that pushed the artist out of the project,’ notes the Lumiere Project’s Patrice Poujol, whose film company’s NFTs emphasise ‘real access and real experiences’\n\n",
    "content": "The non-fungible token (NFT) mania of 2021 was a phenomenon to behold. Dozens, if not hundreds, of celebrities were either pedalling NFT projects or creating their own. Savvy investors were making hundreds of millions of dollars, and it seemed like art – particularly digital art – was more lucrative than ever.\n\nMore importantly, the blockchain technology that allowed buyers to irrefutably own said artworks was set to revolutionise the art business. Artists could now sell their work directly in open marketplaces, and investors could buy and sell pieces instantly, without the need to travel to art galleries, work through an intermediary or find storage space for their collections.\n\n\n\nBuying, selling and investing in art was suddenly easier and more accessible than it had ever been.\n\nThis phenomenon was supposed to thrive regardless of how well the cryptocurrency market was doing. After all, theoretically, if the price of the cryptocurrency used to buy an NFT dropped, it would mean you’d be buying the art at a discount.\n\nInstead, what we saw during the crypto crash of 2022 was that NFTs were hit even harder. Top NFT projects like “Bored Ape Yacht Club”, which during its peak had every piece selling for tens of thousands of US dollars, saw valuations drop by over 90 per cent. The crash led to speculation that NFT mania was never about the art at all, despite what a lot of Web3 enthusiasts wanted to believe. It was about the hype. So where did it all go wrong?\n\n“Arthur Hayes [co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMex] wrote an article stating that during the crypto bubble, people didn’t make money on the implementation of projects: they made their big 100-times returns based on speculation,” said Dr Patrice Poujol, who launched a Web3 film company, the Lumiere Project, in 2019. “NFTs didn’t quite work because investors didn’t perceive the value that producers thought was there, and prices came crashing back down to Earth.”\n\n\n\nPoujol, who received the first-ever PhD in Hong Kong on Web3 and creative industries at City University of Hong Kong, is a big believer in Web3 technology and the potential of NFTs to create more vibrant ecosystems in all forms of art – from film and music, to digital art and paintings. However, he adds, implementation has been stifled by corporate greed and oversaturation.\n\n“The problem is that these technologies have been reappropriated by businessmen to, instead of helping the artist, squeeze them out of the game,” he explained. “If you look at NFTs, it started out really interestingly with artists like Beeple becoming massive successes, and we started to think, ‘Wow, this is going to allow artists to become millionaires.’ But what we saw within months, not even years, was that art became an auto-generated aesthetic that pushed the artist out of the project.”\n\nThe rise of NFTs coincided with the first editions of AI art, which allowed artists to create pieces within a matter of minutes. This led to the oversaturation of NFT marketplaces. Additionally, with the exception of a few creative artists like Beeple, the most successful NFT projects were those with appealing branding and prestige.\n\n\n\nAn obvious example of this is the aforementioned “Bored Ape Yacht Club”. It mass-produced JPEGs of the exact same ape in different outfits and colour schemes. It’s hard to argue that these easily reproducible two-dimensional sprites became worth up to US$3.4 million by being at the absolute cutting edge of creative digital artistry.\n\n“My question is – when it comes to Bored Apes, CryptoPunks and all the big projects that came out: how many artists came out of this besides a select few? The answer is: there’s hardly anyone,” Poujol said. “There should be an encyclopaedia of artists, but that’s not the case,” he added, noting that in many cases, the artists themselves were not well rewarded for their work, while the companies producing the NFTs were.\n\n“Grand promises that NFTs would put artists at the centre of the structured gain all disappeared,” he continued. “Apart from established artists, it was really difficult for emerging ones with no followers. It’s now a long shot, and what we saw with NFTs was actually a reappropriation of art for monetary purposes.”\n\n\n\nPoujol thinks that the increased sophistication of AI art has led to a digital-art NFT marketplace akin to a “Netflix on steroids”. With this level of oversaturation, it’s hard for an artist to stand out and find their own voice.\n\nBut with art becoming increasingly generic and uniform, Poujol thinks there is an opportunity for artists who make an effort to show the human element in their art.\n\nHe is still optimistic about NFTs and Web3 technology. In fact, they form a major part of Lumiere. For example, someone can purchase an NFT and use it to influence a decision in film production – say, over what type of shirt the lead actor wears in a certain scene.\n\n“This is what you can sell as an NFT, and this is the potential it has as a technology for the art world – not just a picture of a random celebrity, or a JPEG of apes, but real access and real experiences,” said Poujol.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the crypto crash got rid of a lot of the scammers and hype trains. What remains are real projects and real artists in it for the long-run. What’s more, as the market matures, there will hopefully be more deserving, hard-working artists who get the recognition and money they deserve.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen an incredible rally over the past few months, with bitcoin hitting an all-time high of US$73,800 in mid-March. If another major crypto bull run begins, could we see a resurgence of NFTs? If so, what will the new marketplace look like? Will prices be less volatile? Will valuations be based more on artistic merit than hype and status?\n\nThe answers to these questions remain to be seen, and it will be interesting to find out over the coming months.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Tokenisation has proved to be cheaper, more efficient and better than ‘the old-fashioned way of trading’, Noel Quinn says, but HSBC will stay ‘away from crypto’.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong’s largest commercial bank, HSBC, plans to expand its line-up of tokenised assets so its customers can enjoy the benefits of such digital products, but will make sure these offerings are grounded in reality, according to the bank’s CEO. It intends to steer away from volatile cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Tokenisation is a more efficient trading mechanism and provides liquidity to that asset,” Noel Quinn said during a private media round table in Hong Kong last week. “In theory, you can tokenise anything. The key criteria for me is, is there substance behind the token? Has it got predictability? Does it exist?”\n\nHis comments came shortly after the launch of HSBC’s Gold Token, the first such retail product to be issued by a bank in Hong Kong, as the government pushes for the roll-out of more digital assets to the public.\n\nTokenised products can be recorded digitally on a blockchain, offered directly to end-investors, distributed by intermediaries, or traded. They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\n\n\nAccording to Quinn, tokenisation has shown to be cheaper, more efficient and better than “the old-fashioned way of trading”. There are more applications of tokenisation that the bank wants to explore.\n\n“We continue to invest in our tokenisation product line-up. I think tokenisation of gold and bond issues are good [examples],” he said. “I’m very comfortable with the concept of tokenisation.”\n\nWhile not mentioning specifics, Quinn said the bank will look at ways to tokenise assets that are “backed by something real”.\n\n\n\nGold and bonds are “a real asset”, whereas a cryptocurrency may be based on similar technology, but is more volatile and unpredictable. HSBC would be “staying away from crypto”, Quinn said.\n\nSpeaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit last week, the city’s regulators were confident Hong Kong will be a world leader in tokenisation. Part of its efforts is the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nWhile still in its early days, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the second phase of a pilot programme in March to explore use cases for a CBDC. Some of the use cases tested so far include online payments, payments in shops, the collection of government payouts, tokenised deposits, tokenised asset settlement and Web3 trading and clearing.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong government completed the world’s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million last month. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion’s private blockchain as part of the HKMA’s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduces the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and makes secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n“People are increasingly engaging in conversations about digital assets, and tokenised gold is one kind of asset that can be as liquid as conventional assets,” John O’Neill, the bank’s global head of digital assets strategy, said at the bank’s summit last week.\n\n",

They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the SFC.\n\n“Asset tokenisation can enable convenient, affordable and broad access to real-world and financial assets, in this case, the HSBC Gold Token,” said Sami Abouzahr, Hong Kong head of investments and wealth solutions at HSBC.\n\nHSBC Gold Token is the first of a series of planned retail products that will use HSBC Orion.\n\nPreviously, the platform helped to tokenise physical gold in London for institutional investors and launch digital green bonds in Hong Kong.\n\nLast month, the Hong Kong government completed the world’s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion’s private blockchain as part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduced the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and made secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n“Investors had the option to follow largely business-as-usual processes through traditional market infrastructure, i.e. the CMU in Hong Kong and its external linkages with [clearing houses],” Darryl Chan, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, said at an event staged by the International Capital Market Association in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\n\n“This has significantly broadened the bond’s investor base and enhanced its liquidity. It is fair to say that the issuance brought tokenised bonds further beyond proof-of-concept, towards achieving more common applications.”\n\nAt Tuesday’s Milken Institute Global Investors’ Symposium, HSBC Hong Kong’s chief digital officer Bojan Obradović said the blockchain ledger has “strong potential to be a mainstream component of future financial markets”.\n\nHSBC is focusing on investing in distributed ledger technology, identifying which assets to develop as digital products, be it funds and bonds, tokens representing real-world assets or digital money, according to Obradović.\n\nAs well as working with the HKMA on its proposed central bank digital currency at the retail and wholesale levels, the lender is creating its own tokenised deposits and researching stablecoins.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is formulating a regulatory regime to sell stablecoins to retail investors. Stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets issued by private entities against a portfolio of traditional financial assets.\n\nObradović praised the government’s efforts to develop the sector.\n\n“Hong Kong has got a real opportunity to become the world’s leading digital asset hub,” he said.\n\n“How we get the buy and sell-side to come to Hong Kong and get real transactions to take place and have real economic value will be key.”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The Securities and Futures Commission has warned of a fraudulent crypto trading platform called Quantum AI, a long-time scam that uses deepfakes of Elon Musk.\n\n",
    "content": "Last week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned of a scam using deepfakes of Elon Musk touting a cryptocurrency trading platform called “Quantum AI”. The scam is old, but it highlights an alarming rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud – and Asia has proven particularly susceptible.\n\nIn its public warning on May 8, the SFC said that Quantum AI makes claims of being able to earn “too-good-to-be-true” returns and the regulator made a request to the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to related websites and social media pages. The linked domains were inaccessible as of this week, and the Facebook groups appear to have been removed.\n\nThere have already been multiple cases of deepfake-related incidents of fraud in Hong Kong, putting the government on alert. Deepfake incidents in Asia-Pacific surged 1,530 per cent last year, with Vietnam and Japan seeing the most attacks, according to a report from identity verification platform Sumsub.\n\n“Thanks to increasing digital financial transactions in the emerging Asia market, there is a larger pool for deepfake targets,” said Penny Chai, Sumsub’s vice-president of business development in APAC. “Since a high volume of instant cross-border transactions takes place in the region, especially in Hong Kong, deepfake scammers can leverage the complexity and volume of financial dealings to carry out fraudulent activities.”\n\nThe Quantum AI scam dates back at least a year, although it seems to be recycled with different variations used to target different groups.\n\nOne video spread on Facebook last year, debunked by PolitiFact, featured Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, alongside Jack Ma – co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post – promoting the platform. It was modified from a video of Musk and Ma appearing together at the 2019 World AI Conference in Shanghai.\n\nAnother video was modified from an appearance Musk made on the Fox News show of conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, according to Reuters Fact Check.\n\nSome of the domains using the scheme rely on cheap hosting providers and flexible back-end technologies like WordPress. One of the top search results for Quantum AI is a website saying it requires a US$250 minimum deposit, accompanied by a warning that users should “invest only what you’re okay with losing completely”.\n\nIncidents of fraud using deepfakes – convincing simulacra of real people using generative AI – are on the rise. Sumsub – which tracks incidents of identity fraud, including through the use of deepfakes – detected a tenfold increase in the use of deepfakes last year, according to its Identity Fraud report.\n\nSumsub identified Hong Kong as one of the top five markets in Asia for identity fraud at a rate of 3.3 per cent last year. Bangladesh had the highest at 5.4 per cent.\n\nIn the first quarter, fintech industry fraud in Hong Kong grew at a rate of 3.8 per cent, which was 216 per cent faster than the rate in the same period a year earlier, Sumsub told the Post.\n\nDeepfakes have already caused tens of millions of dollars in losses in the city.\n\nIn 2020, a manager at a Japanese bank was fooled by fake audio mimicking his director’s voice into transferring US$35 million. Another multinational company lost US$25.6 million to a fraud involving a deepfake video call mimicking the likeness of the chief financial officer.\n\nThe SFC has become increasingly hawkish in flagging crypto-related scams on its website. Of the 29 suspicious virtual asset trading platforms listed by the SFC, 18 of the warnings were issued this year, and 24 of them were issued since JPEX scandal last September.\n\nThat incident tied the JPEX cryptocurrency exchange to the loss of roughly HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million), making it one of the largest financial frauds in the city’s history.\n\nThe regulator has also been more active in flagging other suspicious crypto-related products. On Monday, it warned of an investment product called LENA Network that involves cryptocurrency staking, borrowing and lending arrangements.\n\nArrangements for staking, which requires locking up a certain amount of crypto to validate transactions on a blockchain, could “amount to unauthorised collective investment schemes”, the SFC warned, and “may be highly risky”.\n\n",

    "content": "Canaan, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency-mining equipment maker, has unveiled in Hong Kong an energy-saving machine designed to help miners stay competitive after the rewards for mining bitcoin were reduced by 50 per cent after the recent “halving” event.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed company launched the latest A1566 model of its flagship Avalon A15 series on Thursday at the Bitcoin Asia 2024 conference. The debut of the new mining rigs came weeks after bitcoin’s fourth halving event.\n\nOccuring roughly every four years, halving is an algorithmic instruction built into the bitcoin blockchain to manage the cryptocurrency’s supply and maintain its scarcity.\n\nThe latest halving event, which occurred on April 19, slashed the amount of bitcoin that miners receive for operating the powerful computers that verify transactions on the blockchain. That means older computers that are less energy-efficient will need to spend more on electricity to obtain the same quantity of bitcoin as before.\n\n“The bitcoin halving is a challenge, but also an opportunity, ” said Davis Hui, vice-president at Canaan, in an interview with the Post.\n\nAs halving reduces the supply of new bitcoin, halving events have historically triggered a sharp rise in the cryptocurrency’s price. The past three halvings – in 2020, 2016 and 2012 – resulted in an average price increase of 16 per cent over the following 60 days, according to 10x Research, a digital asset consultancy.\n\n“That’s why we chose this timing to launch our new bitcoin-mining machines to help our miners get through this time’s halving,” Hui said. The new machine can compute more data, while consuming less energy compared to previous models, he said.\n\nDespite the latest halving event, bitcoin prices have been on a downward trend in recent weeks, as the US Federal Reserve puts off cutting interest rates.\n\nCanaan last year reported a 67.5 per cent plunge in total revenue to US$211.5 million, citing lower selling price of its equipment because of “overall soft purchasing power from the market demand front”. Mining equipment sales revenue fell 71.5 per cent to US$175.9 million, according to the company’s financial statement.\n\n“While we acknowledge the persisting challenges of the ongoing bearish market for mining machines, we draw inspiration from the recent approval and listing of spot bitcoin ETFs,” said Nangeng Zhang, chairman and CEO of Canaan.\n\nHong Kong’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the first of its kind in Asia, debuted last week, after 11 US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January following a green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFounded in 2013, Canaan has businesses in the US, Canada, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, with over 20 maintenance support sites around the world.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Her brand L’Dezen was one of the first jewellery companies to incorporate NFTs, enabling customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of pieces – but these days Shah is more interested in AI\n\n",
    "content": "Payal Shah is deeply entrenched in Hong Kong’s art and tech scenes. Her jewellery company L’Dezen, founded more than 12 years ago, was one of the first to incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of her pieces.\n\nShah, who has over 115,000 followers on Instagram, has always been both artistic and tech-savvy. She is one of the most vocal voices on X posting about Web3, and was named by Tatler Asia as one of the 30 most influential women in the NFT space. Now, she’s one of the most influential female voices on artificial intelligence (AI) in Hong Kong.\n\nShe attributes much of the success of L’Dezen and her own personal brand to her dedication to following the latest tech trends. “In this competitive world, you have to find ways to grow and stay ahead of the curve,” said Shah. “If you’re constantly involved in what’s available and innovating, then all of a sudden you’re keeping your brand relevant, and that gives you a competitive edge that you’d normally need to pay millions of dollars for.”\n\n\n\nRecently, Shah’s focus has shifted away from Web3 and NFTs to AI. Though she still likes the core ideals of NFTs, namely the idea of giving ownership back to the artist without the influence of a third-party entity, she feels that things haven’t unfolded the way she had originally hoped, at least thus far.\n\n“I love the conversations and I love it from the artist’s perspective, being an artist and jeweller myself, but I don’t know if there’s going to be mainstream adoption any time soon,” she said. “The onboarding process is still too much of a hurdle for people to have a cryptocurrency wallet as easily as they’d have, say, an Apple Wallet. And because of all of the scammers in the industry, I have some artist friends who say they would never touch it.”\n\nShah now regularly hosts seminars and workshops with a focus on educating artists and entrepreneurs about how to use AI. “Research is a huge part of the design process – what the latest trends are or where they’re headed, and AI makes that process way more efficient,” she explained. “You’re creating with the idea of: yeah, I’m an artist, but I want to make sure this art converts into sales, so I need to incorporate data. So I’ll find out, how much do my potential customers spend per year on jewellery? What’s the material of the year? And so on.”\n\n\n\nAs a boot camp and training organiser at Female Entrepreneurs Worldwide, one of Shah’s main passions is educating women about AI. “I don’t want AI to be completely male dominated the way Web3 was; I really want AI to include all genders,” she explained.\n\nAnother reason Shah wants female entrepreneurs and artists to become more tech-savvy is that she thinks that AI is both more important and more transformative than Web3, especially in the art space. “If you completely ignored Web3 [during the peak mania phase], you’d still be completely fine,” she said. “But you can’t ignore AI. The phone you’re using probably uses AI. Most of the apps you use are already using AI. That’s why education, especially for women, is so important.”\n\nShah does her best to keep her workshops fun and playful, while teaching important skills like prompt engineering, data analysis, as well as going over the latest trends and developments in the space. Though Shah is an AI optimist, she understands the concerns that a lot of artists have about generative AI art and the ease with which art can be produced by AI programs; concerns about whether AI generated art is “real”; and the potential threat to the livelihood of artists who have spent years perfecting their craft.\n\n\n\nShe, like many others, is especially concerned about OpenAI’s latest project, Sora – an AI-powered, text-to-video model that will allow people to make films in a matter of minutes. “What usually requires 30 people to get on set for photoshoots and video shoots, and their whole livelihoods are based on this – a lot of it is going to get wiped out thanks to Sora, and the number of shows and films is going to be overwhelming,” Shah said.\n\nWhile she understands the sentiment that artists share, Shah added, “[AI is] not a real person: it’s just mimicking a bunch of different people’s information that’s been given, and turning that into art.” She believes that art with a human touch will be at a premium, and her advice to young and upcoming artists is to never let their art lose its human element.\n\n“You can think of the AI as a second brain,” she continued. “An amazing, high-IQ assistant, but your brain has to be involved, and you have to give the AI something human and relevant when prompting – and that will always require you to work and do your own research.”\n\n",

    "content": "FTX says that nearly all of its customers will receive the money back that they are owed, two years after the cryptocurrency exchange imploded, and some will get more than that.\n\nFTX said in a court filing on Tuesday that it owes about US$11.2 billion to its creditors. The exchange estimates that it has between US$14.5 billion and US$16.3 billion to distribute to them.\n\nThe filing said that after paying claims in full, the plan provides for supplemental interest payments to creditors, to the extent that funds still remain. The interest rate for most creditors is 9 per cent.\n\nThat may be a diminished consolation for investors who were trading cryptocurrency on the exchange when it collapsed.\n\nWhen FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, bitcoin was going for US$16,080. But cryptocurrency prices have soared as the economy recovered while the assets at FTX were sorted out over the past two years.\n\nA single bitcoin on Tuesday was selling for close to US$62,675. That comes out to a 290 per cent loss, a bit less than that if accrued interest is counted, if those investors had held onto those coins.\n\nCustomers and creditors that claim US$50,000 or less will get about 118 per cent of their claim, according to the plan, which was filed with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This covers about 98 per cent of FTX customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetising a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world when it filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.\n\nCEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned when the exchange collapsed. In March, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the massive fraud that occurred at FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy – a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 per cent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,” Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on June 25.\n\n",

    "summary": "HKVAEX is advising users to withdraw funds this month ahead of its May 1 shutdown, just three months after it submitted an application for a crypto licence.\n\n",
    "content": "The Binance-affiliated cryptocurrency exchange HKVAEX is shutting down its operations in Hong Kong after withdrawing its application for a licence in the city, ending a bid that lasted just three months.\n\nIn the company’s official group chat on the messaging platform Telegram, HKVAEX head of operations Walton Chan announced the closure and said users should withdraw their assets by April 30. The website will shut down on May 1, the company said its official announcement, and trading services will end on April 5. Deposits and new user registrations have already been suspended.\n\nThe exchange is winding down operations less than two months after former CEO Stanley Fung left the company. Fung said he is “not privy to the details surrounding their recent decision”. He did not say why he decided to leave the company.\n\nHKVAEX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe closure comes just over a year since the company launched its virtual asset trading platform (VATP) in February 2023, securing its position as a pre-existing service provider so that it would have a one-year window to apply for a licence after a new regulation from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took effect in June. The exchange submitted its application in January, well ahead of the February 29 deadline, but the SFC’s website shows that it was withdrawn on March 28.\n\nThe company’s ties to Binance have raised questions about whether it would be able to successfully secure a licence, especially after the crypto giant was found guilty of breaking US anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nThe Post reported last October that Binance was behind HKVAEX, which was set up as a separate entity in Hong Kong and shares digital resources with the world’s largest crypto exchange. Binance has said that HKVAEX is “not in the Binance Group of companies”.\n\nIts retreat from the market leaves Binance as the only major crypto player founded in China that does not have an affiliate or subsidiary pursuing a VATP licence in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong entity under OKX submitted an application last November and Huobi HK, under HBGL Hong Kong, submitted in February.\n\nHTX, formerly Huobi, said Huobi HK operates independently. Before taking over as head of HKVAEX, Fung was CEO of Huobi HK.\n\nHKVAEX did not give a reason for deciding to shut down before the SFC’s application process had concluded. Beyond its ties to Binance, though, VATP operators have expressed concerns about the high compliance costs for getting a licence in Hong Kong, in addition to requirements such as cold storage reserves that are even greater than what is required in neighbouring markets like Singapore.\n\nStill, Fung said he remains “highly optimistic” about the city’s Web3 industry. “I continue to see Hong Kong as a future hub for these technologies and I’m excited about the opportunities this presents,” he said.\n\n",

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are eating into Binance’s share of bitcoin trading outside the US as overseas expansion efforts and changing regulations reshape the competitive dynamics of the digital-asset industry.\n\nOver the past year, the world’s largest crypto exchange saw its share of such bitcoin trading drop to 55.3 per cent from 81.3 per cent, according to research firm Kaiko. For smaller tokens known as altcoins, the proportion fell to 50.5 per cent from 58 per cent.\n\nKaiko pegged the changes to Binance’s decision to end a promotion that scrapped trading fees. “Offshore markets have become less concentrated, with smaller exchanges gaining momentum as trade volumes recovered,” the company’s analysts wrote in a note.\n\nPlatforms like Bybit and OKX have expanded their footprints in regions such as Asia, while Binance has been grappling with the fallout of legal issues. The company and its co-founder Zhao Changpeng pleaded guilty to US anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations in November last year.\n\nBybit’s share of non-US bitcoin trading reached 9.3 per cent over the past year, up from 2 per cent, according to Kaiko. OKX accounts for 7.3 per cent currently, up from 3 per cent.\n\nBinance has been trying to rebuild its reputation while operating under the watchful gaze of US regulators. Under new boss Richard Teng – a former regulator in Singapore – the exchange has tightened token listing rules and appointed a board of directors.\n\nThe digital-asset industry as a whole has benefited from a fourfold jump in the bitcoin price since the start of last year. The rebound from a 2022 rout took the token to a record high of US$73,798 last month, catalysing trading volumes.\n\n",

    "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, made a rare last-minute appearance at a Hong Kong crypto conference on Tuesday, despite previously expressing scepticism about the city’s commitment to supporting the industry.\n\nButerin gave two keynote speeches at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Tuesday, the final day of the four-day event, focusing on blockchain technology. His in-person attendance came as a surprise to many, as it was only announced by the conference on Monday evening.\n\nThe entrepreneur, regarded as a major figure in crypto communities because of his influence over one of the world’s most widely used blockchains, last year cautioned industry players about setting up shop in Hong Kong, suggesting the stability of the city’s new-found support for virtual assets as of the end of 2022 could be fickle.\n\n\n\n“Obviously it’s very friendly now,” Buterin said at the Web3 Transitions Summit in Singapore in September 2023. “But the big question I’m asking, and I think [everyone] is asking, is how stable is the level of friendliness.”\n\nHe added that if a crypto project wants to make Hong Kong their home, it would need to be confident that the city will continue to be friendly to the sector many years from now, “when all kinds of unknown, regulatory and political events are going to happen”.\n\nButerin acknowledged at the time that he does not “understand Hong Kong well”, and even less the “complicated interaction between Hong Kong and the mainland lately”.\n\nHis comments prompted a response from Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, who said on X, formerly Twitter, that “Hong Kong’s policies and laws will not change overnight”, and dismissed the idea of any complications because Beijing supports the “one country, two systems” arrangement that allows the city some policy autonomy. Commercial use of cryptocurrency is strictly banned in mainland China.\n\nNg also invited Buterin to “come to Hong Kong to understand the situation”.\n\nButerin is one of the few heavyweight speakers who attended the Hong Kong event this year, as the city increased its efforts to woo international crypto talent and businesses with the goal of becoming a virtual asset hub. The hall was completely packed with crypto faithful at an event where attendance had been patchy most days.\n\nHis talk, however, was just over 20 minutes and dealt strictly with technical upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain. He then left as quickly as he appeared, taking no questions.\n\nInvestor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, dialled in remotely on the first day of the conference. In an onstage interview with HashKey Capital, she applauded Hong Kong’s virtual asset policy initiatives and suggested that the US is lagging behind. The investor also gave a highly optimistic view of bitcoin’s future, predicting that the token will trade at US$1.5 million by 2030.\n\n",

    "content": "The CEO of Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, is developing a new peer-to-peer technology that he hopes will further wrest financial control from big institutions, and the cryptocurrency giant he heads is pouring millions of dollars into it.\n\nTether intends to invest tens of millions of dollars into a new peer-to-peer chat and video conferencing app called Keet to make it “one of three most known communication applications in the world”, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and co-founder of Keet developer Holepunch, told the Post in an interview.\n\nBuilt on a new peer-to-peer protocol called Pear Runtime, which Holepunch launched two months ago, the absence of any middleman or centralised server aligns with the ethos of Tether and Ardoino, who said he seeks to offer greater financial freedom.\n\n“[At Tether] we are bitcoiners at heart. We believe in the bitcoin mission that is bringing financial freedom to the world,” Ardoino said in a chat conducted over Keet on Wednesday. “If you have financial freedom, but you don’t have freedom of speech … we are not really free, right?”\n\n\n\nTether was started in Hong Kong 10 years ago and has since transformed into a critical component of Web3, often as a main source of liquidity for other cryptocurrencies because of its peg to the US dollar. Tether still has an active corporate entity in Hong Kong, according to government records, but Ardoino said it is “dormant” and the company no longer has personnel in the city.\n\nWith Tether now the world’s default blockchain-based dollar, Ardoino sees his new venture as taking on technology giants such as Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp, and Google. As a peer-to-peer technology, Pear Runtime eliminates the need for expensive server infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on building the apps, Ardoino said.\n\nIts ability to do this hinges on the backing of Tether, which Ardoino noted made more than US$6 billion in profit last year.\n\n“We don’t care to make more money,” he said. “We are investing in … companies that are aligned with the vision of bringing freedom and creating tools that are ready for the apocalypse.”\n\nKeet, built in-house by Holepunch, is the first flagship tool using Pear Runtime. Like other peer-to-peer apps, users connect directly to other computers, so their internet protocol (IP) addresses are exposed to others in a chat room – although Keet does not directly make that information visible in the app. However, Ardoino said messages are end-to-end encrypted and traffic cannot be publicly monitored, so only the people a user chats with can see those addresses.\n\nThe company is not able to share developer statistics for the same reason, according to Holepunch CEO Mathias Buus Madsen. But there is “definitely a big percentage” coming from Asia, including India and “the Hong Kong area”, he said.\n\nThe app has already built in some cryptocurrency functionality by including a Lightning wallet. The Lightning Network is a so-called layer 2 payment protocol on the bitcoin blockchain that allows for fast and cheap transfers of small amounts of bitcoin. The Holepunch team is also working fast to integrate Tether, also known as USDT.\n\n“Bitcoin is the unstoppable money, and Keet is the unstoppable app. That’s why we thought it’s more appropriate to have bitcoin first,” Ardoino said. “Nevertheless, USDT will come probably soon, in the next few months.”\n\nAs the crypto sector rebounds from the 2022 crash, the total market value of Tether’s USDT stablecoin surpassed US$100 billion last month and now sits at about US$106 billion, according to data on CoinGecko. The total value of stablecoins in circulation stands at US$152 billion, giving Tether a nearly 70 per cent market share, according to market tracker DefiLlama.\n\nIts outsize presence in the industry has also invited increasing scrutiny in recent years and criticism of a lack of transparency about the reserves backing USDT.\n\nTether Holdings, now based in the British Virgin Islands, has traditionally revealed little information about itself. It was started by the same people behind the crypto exchange Bitfinex, where Ardoino serves as chief technology officer (CTO). Ardoino joined Bitfinex as a software developer in October 2014 and became CTO of Tether in 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nTether has been publishing quarterly attestations of its reserves, and in October the company told Bloomberg that it would start publishing data on its reserves in real time. Ardoino did not share a timeline for that when asked, but said that a full audit remains challenging because the 2022 collapse of FTX made major accounting firms more hesitant to work with major crypto firms for fear of reputational risks.\n\n“FTX didn’t make our life easier,” he said.\n\nAnother source of controversy has been the widespread use of USDT in cybercrime.\n\nArdoino slammed some of the reporting that has been done on Tether in recent years, saying the company works with the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations and Secret Service to track criminals using USDT.\n\n“You have to be a really, really stupid criminal to use Tether,” Ardoino said, pointing to the transparency of its data because it is run on a public blockchain.\n\nMembers of criminal gangs using slave labour in place like Myanmar may not fear legal repercussions in countries they will never visit. This is just one reason law enforcement agencies are concerned about the increasing use of encrypted services that hide traces of illegal activity.\n\nMeanwhile, financial regulators have raised concerns about the impact of stablecoins on financial stability owing to issues such as capital flight. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced stablecoin regulations for public consultation in December that would require issuers to get licensed.\n\nTether is also “following the development of regulations” in Hong Kong, Ardoino said, adding that it is in discussions with local firms to explore ways to engage the Hong Kong market.\n\nAsked if he thinks an app like Keet could accelerate illegal money flows or impact financial stability, Ardoino demurred.\n\n“USDT helps the last mile. Those are the people [whose] entire wealth is US$100 and they don’t have a bank account,” he said. “Bankers don’t care about us.”\n\nStill, Ardoino made it clear that there is an ideological component underpinning the new P2P protocol. He pointed to a quote by the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s second Batman film The Dark Knight that “reflects well” the mission of Keet.\n\n“It’s not about money; it’s about sending a message.”\n\n",

    "content": "Two brothers who studied at MIT were charged with exploiting a weakness in the Ethereum blockchain and stealing US$25 million in 12 seconds, in what prosecutors called a first-of-its-kind caper.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with fraud and money laundering offences. They are accused of carrying out the lightning-fast heist, plotted over the course of months, from their keyboards last year.\n\n“The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialised skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,” Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.\n\nThe two studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with Anton graduating in February with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and math and James graduating with a Master of Science in aeronautics and astronautics in 2021.\n\nLawyers for the Peraire-Bueno brothers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The brothers, who were arrested Tuesday in Boston and New York.\n\nThe US Justice Department has been focused on stamping out fraud and misconduct in the cryptocurrency industry, winning convictions of several high-profile industry executives, most notably Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, who also went to MIT.\n\nEthereum is known as the biggest commercial highway in cryptocurrency, used by thousands of apps and focused on everything from finance to gaming.\n\nThe US says the brothers set up something called validators, which are designed to help order transactions on the Ethereum network and to help bots make money by facilitating arbitrage and other profitable trades.\n\nInstead, they put their own validators in place to deceive the traders operating the bots, according to prosecutors.\n\nThey secured access to pending transactions and altered the movement of electronic currency to steal the cryptocurrency, the government alleges. The pair then moved the cryptocurrency through a web of transactions in an attempt to hide the source of the funds, according to the US.\n\nThe two allegedly spent months planning the heist, including studying the trading behaviours of Ethereum bots and setting up shell companies to operate behind.\n\nThey searched online for cryptocurrency exchanges with limited “know your customer” procedures they could use to launder their ill-gotten gains and even researched extradition procedures, prosecutors say.\n\n",

    "summary": "The background of Sheikh Ali Rashed Ali Saeed Al Maktoum has come under the spotlight, and one of his close aides has a mixed track record as an entrepreneur.\n\n",
    "content": "A close aide of a Dubai prince who suddenly postponed the opening ceremony of his Hong Kong family office has a history of unsuccessful blockchain ventures and was involved in a solar plant deal in the United States that collapsed due to a lack of funding, public records show.\n\nSheikh Ali Rashed Ali Saeed Al Maktoum, reportedly the nephew of Dubai’s ruler and prime minister, grabbed headlines earlier this month when he pledged to open a US$500 million family office in Hong Kong and made appearances at high-profile events in the city over the past week.\n\nBut he unexpectedly pushed back the opening ceremony of the office by two months and questions have swirled about his business track record and connections to the ruling family.\n\nScrutiny has now fallen on his close aides, including the office’s director of international strategic relations William Tien, also known as Tien Chwan Hoa.\n\nTien was involved in the blockchain-based digital wallet TiENPAY that folded and was a director of a company tied to a solar plant deal in Arizona that imploded when a newspaper exposé revealed the backers could not provide the financing.\n\nIn explaining Thursday’s postponement of the launch ceremony of Maktoum’s family office at the eleventh hour, his private office pointed to “some urgent matters in Dubai that needed his attention”.\n\n“It has been confirmed that the operation of the sheikh’s family office in Hong Kong will proceed as planned,” the office said on Friday evening. “It is merely the inauguration ceremony that has been planned will now be postponed until Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum comes [to] town again at the end of May.”\n\nMaktoum also expressed his “sincere gratitude” to the Hong Kong government, including the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and InvestHK, for their help in establishing his office in the city, and apologised for any inconvenience caused.\n\nThe statement did not elaborate on the urgent matters that led to the abrupt delay and did not address the prince’s business experience or family ties.\n\n\n\nThe private office’s website was created less than a year ago, with the domain name registered on May 29, 2023, through Domains by Proxy, according to whois records.\n\nCommunications with the press have been managed by Eleanor Jane Mak, vice-chairman and CEO of the prince’s family office. She remains a director of China New Energy Skyrail International and nine other locally registered companies.\n\nRepresentatives of the prince’s office, according to the Friday evening statement, have been in contact with China New Energy Skyrail, which has previously advanced a monorail project for the Kai Tak development area in Hong Kong. The office said its staff had visited Beijing, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou and Chengdu in mainland China to explore opportunities.\n\nWilliam Tien was the representative who signed a cooperation deal with the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong on behalf of the office on Tuesday.\n\nThe entrepreneur, who identifies himself as the president and CEO of the US-based Axis Technologies Group on his LinkedIn account, is no stranger to setting up businesses in Hong Kong, holding directorships in at least seven locally registered companies under the name “Tien Chwan Hoa”.\n\nTien was a director of TiENPAY, which was dissolved last year. TiENPAY labelled itself a software developer involved in mobile wallet and blockchain projects, as well as the crypto-to-crypto digital exchange T8EX. The TiENPAY website is no longer accessible.\n\nTiENPAY was previously known as Zentric (HK) and had entered into an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Matinee Energy to build solar power plants in Benson, Arizona, in January of 2012, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission made that year.\n\n\n\nThe solar project later ran into trouble and Zentric’s lack of a track record in the field was exposed in a bombshell report by the Phoenix New Times, which described the two US-based companies headed by Tien at the time – including Alpha Lujo – as “broke”.\n\nZentric reportedly pulled out of the project “just before press time” after the Arizona newspaper made email inquiries, with Tien claiming in a letter that his firm was “unable to arrange for sufficient financing” to meet the project’s deadlines.\n\nContractors of the project have since launched legal battles against executives of Matinee Energy demanding compensation, which Zentric and Tien were not involved in.\n\nOne of Tien’s newest ventures is Asian Carbon Holdings, which was incorporated last October, two months before the prince’s previous visit to Hong Kong. Tien had touted his experience in green sectors when being interviewed as chairman of Asian Carbon Holdings last December.\n\n“I started working on carbon capture and storage projects in 2009, and it has become more and more common in the past few years. They call it carbon neutralisation in China. So we have rich experience in this industry,” he told a broadcaster at an event that the prince attended as well.\n\nIn the interview he suggested a project to facilitate carbon credit trading through blockchain tokenisation of real-world assets. The idea seemed to align with a plan of Maktoum’s office to focus on “sustainable business ties between the UAE and Asia”.\n\nTien is a Singaporean passport holder with a correspondence address at a residential block at a housing estate in the city state, according to a new filing made this month for a Hong Kong company called Space Node Lab.\n\nHe listed a pair of US and Singapore mobile numbers on his business card for his role in the prince’s family office, though the former could not be reached and the latter was not in use. The Post has reached out to Tien by email.\n\nThe Dubai prince’s ambitious investment plan attracted considerable attention and interest from mainland Chinese enterprises, but some raised concerns after finding scarce public information about him.\n\n\n\nQuestions about Maktoum’s relationship with the prime minister were also raised by academics who study the history of the royal families of the Gulf states.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the royals said Maktoum was from a “distant branch” of the ruling family. The UAE consulate earlier confirmed that Maktoum was “from the ruling family” and “a sheikh” – an honorific title designating a royal family member.\n\nIn the first statement issued on Friday, Maktoum’s office also painted the 28-year-old as a “visionary leader and patriot of cultural arts dedicated to fostering positive changes that extend beyond the borders of Dubai” and highlighted his recent appointment as an honorary professor in sustainability leadership at Hang Seng University.\n\n“Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum believes that the opening of his family office in Hong Kong is just the start of his global public service,” it added.\n\nHang Seng University told the Post on Friday that the delayed opening of the office would have no impact on the operation of the Asia-Pacific Asean Green Deal Centre.\n\nThe Hong Kong government distanced itself from the matter on Thursday, saying it would not comment on the business activities of individuals.\n\nThe prince had spoken at a key family office summit in Hong Kong a day earlier, co-organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and InvestHK.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong and Shenzhen have begun to test cross-border information verification between the two cities, as they take early steps in enabling the exchange of business data across the Greater Bay Area (GBA), starting with the financial industry.\n\nThe first phase of the pilot trial will focus on the cross-border verification of credit reports by credit reference agencies and commercial banks, according to a statement published on Monday by WeBank, the Shenzhen-based virtual lender providing the technology underpinning the data-flow platform.\n\nAs China moves to build a legal and regulatory mechanism to screen data entering and leaving the mainland border, observers have warned that stringent requirements, including security assessments, could hurt Hong Kong’s role as a base for foreign investors to manage their mainland operations.\n\nThe new data-verification platform will test Beijing’s plan to keep watch on cross-border data flows without disrupting normal business operations.\n\nAs part of the trial, Shenzhen Credit Services and Nova Credit in Hong Kong will use the platform to verify corporate credit reports. Shenzhen-based Baihang Credit Services and Fusion Bank in Hong Kong will use it to verify credit information. Hong Kong’s Bank of East Asia will use the platform to conduct credit checks of customers at its mainland and Hong Kong branches.\n\nCredit verification is an important step for banks and financial institutions to assess clients, but the process has been interrupted by restrictions on cross-border data transfers between the mainland and Hong Kong.\n\nThe pilot programme, which aims to build the infrastructure needed to support cross-border digital services, will make life and work more convenient for residents, as well as companies looking to expand their businesses, according to the announcement.\n\nThe platform marks another step forward in strengthening data cooperation across the GBA, which is the Chinese government’s scheme to link Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in southern Guangdong province into an integrated economic and business hub.\n\nIn December, the Hong Kong government said it planned to launch a pilot programme for the cross-border transfer of data, covering areas such as health and banking, after the city in July agreed with the Cyberspace Administration of China on draft rules governing the safe flow of data within the GBA.\n\nBuilt on distributed data-transfer protocols and the mainland blockchain platform FISCO BCOS, the data-verification platform will conduct verifications using hash values, which are unique digital fingerprints assigned to data. The platform does not transfer or store cross-border data, according to WeBank.\n\nThe programme is expected to cover more sectors in the future, including cross-border healthcare and daily-life services, the bank said.\n\n",

US District Judge Richard Jones is expected to sentence Zhao on April 30.\n\nOnce the most powerful figure in the crypto industry, Zhao, 47, stepped down as Binance’s chief last November, when he and the exchange admitted to evading anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nBinance agreed to a US$4.32 billion criminal penalty.\n\nProsecutors said Binance, employing a “Wild West” model that welcomed criminals, did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.\n\nThey also said Zhao’s platform supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and was a recipient of a large portion of ransomware proceeds.\n\n“He made a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract users, build his company and line his pockets,” prosecutors said.\n\nIn seeking leniency, Zhao’s lawyers cited the first-time offender’s “unflinching” acceptance of responsibility, his US$50 million criminal fine and that no defendant in a remotely similar case has been imprisoned.\n\nThey also said Zhao made Binance an industry leader on compliance, “despite the initial failures that led to this prosecution”.

    "title": "Hong Kong’s spot crypto ETFs have one big attraction: no tax\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Asia could be attractive to investors looking to avoid US tax laws, but the market is still relatively ‘tiny’.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong’s upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly into cryptocurrencies could be attractive to many Asian investors, industry insiders say, but demand may still be a trickle compared with that in the US.\n\nHong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Monday gave the green light to multiple mainland Chinese fund houses and local virtual asset firms to move forward with their applications to offer ETFs that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world’s two largest crypto tokens.\n\nThe move, which came only a few months after Hong Kong regulators announced plans to allow spot crypto ETFs, was hailed as a major milestone in the city’s pursuit to become a global virtual asset hub. It also gave the market a rare lead over the US, which has yet to make a decision on allowing spot ether ETFs.\n\n“We can expect a healthy level of interest, especially with other Asian jurisdictions staying away from domestic spot bitcoin ETF issuance for now,” said Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs in the US, which were approved in January, are also available worldwide, but many Asian investors may prefer to avoid the hurdle of opening a US investment account and paying the country’s capital gains tax, said Michael Wong, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in Hong Kong.\n\n“It’s just more convenient for Hong Kong investors or probably Asian investors generally, who don’t want to open a US brokerage account,” Wong said.\n\nJust the fact of having to fill out US tax forms could be a deterrent for some investors looking for exposure to bitcoin, according to Wong, who also noted that Hong Kong does not tax capital gains.\n\nHong Kong’s impending approval of bitcoin and ether ETFs is also a “milestone for the digital asset industry at large”, as it “creates an additional regulated avenue for price exposure to the asset class with the ability to trade within the Asian time zone”, said Chengyi Ong, head of APAC policy at blockchain research firm Chainalysis.\n\nOng noted that demand for price exposure to virtual assets is strong in Asia, which accounted for US$791 billion of the US$1.17 trillion of bitcoin traded in February this year, according to data by crypto news and data outlet The Block. North American investors traded US$113 billion in bitcoin that month.\n\nUltimately, though, demand for the Hong Kong products will come down to the size of the local market, the fees charged, and similar factors, Ong said.\n\n“Expense ratio will definitely be something that investors will look at,” said Dechert’s Wong. “If you have a comparable or competitive expense ratio for [Hong Kong’s spot crypto] ETFs, then I’m sure that it will be very appealing to a lot of the investors.”\n\nOthers have been more dismissive of the new products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that the offering is “child’s play” compared with similar products in the US because Hong Kong is a comparatively “tiny” market. “Don’t expect a lot of flows,” he wrote.\n\nFirms planning to launch spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong should now work on fulfilling other requirements before offering them, such as applying to list them on the local stock exchange, as they await for the SFC’s final approval, according to the regulator. Wong estimated that the ETFs could launch by June.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "While there were fewer exhibitors this year, the Web3 Festival has attracted a more international crowd with 80 per cent of participants from outside the city.\n\n",
    "content": "Attendance is down, but enthusiasm is up at Hong Kong’s Web3 Festival this year amid sky-high bitcoin prices that have helped draw in an even greater proportion of overseas participants compared with last year.\n\nThe vast majority of participants – an estimated 80 per cent – came from outside Hong Kong, said Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Saturday in his opening remarks. The 2024 conference has seen more exhibitors from Europe and the US specifically, according to Lu Weiding, CEO of Wanxiang Group, which owns the event organiser HashKey Group.\n\nAs Hong Kong forges ahead with its push to transform into a major crypto hub, it has been attracting more Web3 events to the city and trying to bring in big-name speakers. Investor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, was the most high-profile speaker at this year’s Web3 Festival, although she dialled in remotely for a video chat. She praised Hong Kong’s regulatory efforts and suggested the US is lagging behind.\n\n“We are very impressed with what [Hong Kong] has done in providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for exchanges and institutions from a custody point of view,” Wood said in an onstage interview with HashKey Capital. “This regulatory clarity is critical, we think, to enabling the proliferation of the technology faster perhaps in Hong Kong than in the United States.”\n\nWood encouraged businesses in Hong Kong to take advantage of existing regulatory arbitrage as a “global opportunity”. She also offered an extremely optimistic view of where the price of bitcoin is headed: US$1.5 million by 2030. Its record price was more than US$73,000 on March 13 and currently sits around US$68,000.\n\nThis year’s Web3 Festival started shortly after the conclusion of the WOW Summit and the Liquidity 2024 Institutional Digital Asset Summit, which both dealt with crypto-related topics. Even more events are planned for later this year.\n\nMay will see both Wiki Finance Expo and Bitcoin Asia, and Chainlink will host its SmartCon event in Hong Kong in October. CoinDesk – recently acquired by crypto exchange Bullish, which has strong ties to the city – will bring its major Consensus conference to Hong Kong next year.\n\nStill, the flood of events risks dividing attention, especially with so many other major events taking place in other locations. Token2049 – which holds its flagship event in Singapore and once took place in Hong Kong – is hosting its Dubai conference in two weeks. Paris Blockchain Week is also this week, and ETH Seoul was the last three days of March.\n\nWith other events clustered so closely together, the Web3 Festival was smaller in scale than last year, which happened a few months after Hong Kong announced it’s big crypto push.\n\nThe event this year covers less area in the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, and it has fewer exhibitors, according to HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng. However, the event has more sponsorship revenue than last year, and there are more side events, he said.\n\nHong Kong has maintained its commitment to trying to draw the crypto industry to the city after a number of high-profile scandals and collapses in 2022 and 2023. A mandatory licensing scheme that took effect last year was meant to provide regulatory clarity to make the market more attractive. It has drawn 24 applicants so far.\n\nThe city is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are anticipating the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, as well.\n\n“Hong Kong remains the most exciting global opportunity anywhere for a firm wanting to build a virtual assets business or invest in virtual assets,” said Sean Lawrence, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto data provider Kaiko. The city’s advantages include supportive and clear policy directives, a talent pool with experience in traditional finance, and capital to be allocated to virtual assets, he added.\n\nHowever, he noted that entrepreneurs and investors should be “prepared to commit significant time, money and effort”, which are necessary to build consumer-protected, sustainable businesses in Hong Kong.\n\n",

    "title": "At Bitcoin Asia, crypto enthusiasts look to tap mainland market\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A mix of mainlanders and international visitors showed up at Bitcoin Asia amid surging interest owing to a crypto bull market and recently launched ETFs.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong this year drew a strong crowd from mainland China, according to organisers, but it is a different, smaller mix of people than the Bitcoin Conference is used to seeing in the US.\n\nThe conference, held on Thursday and Friday, had about 5,500 attendees confirmed ahead of the show, not accounting for door registrations, said David Bailey, co-founder and CEO of BTC Inc, which runs the Bitcoin Conference and owns Bitcoin Magazine. Without having data at hand, Bailey estimated that about half of the attendees were from mainland China, where interest in the conference was strong owing to Hong Kong’s recent launch of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an explosion in development of layer 2 projects.\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts also flew in from other countries for the event. Some in the community expressed hope that the city’s supportive policies for the cryptocurrency industry could eventually be an avenue to tapping investors on the mainland, where commercial crypto trading is banned. Several attendees also suggested that they see Hong Kong’s push to become a crypto hub as tacit support from Beijing.\n\n“I think the ETFs were kind of an admission that bitcoin is here to stay,” Bailey said. “There’s no way that Hong Kong just accidentally stumbled into launching an ETF … It wasn’t random.”\n\nCryptocurrency investors also applauded Hong Kong’s new ETFs, as they accept in-kind subscriptions, which allows purchases made with bitcoin and ether. This feature is “very important”, according to Bailey, because crypto investors can use the ETF shares as collaterals for loans. Managers of Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs Harvest Global and ChinaAMC have both said that they are working on pushing ahead with the collateralisation of their ETF products in the city.\n\nThe Hong Kong government, which invited the Bitcoin Conference to hold its Asia event in the city, has been very supportive, according to Bailey. The city has already hosted multiple Web3-related events this year, including the WOW Summit and Web3 Festival, as it seeks to bring in more tourism and crypto industry players.\n\n“I think they see bitcoin as a massive opportunity for Hong Kong,” Bailey said.\n\nBitcoin Asia is much smaller than the US event, which was previously held in Miami, Florida, and this year will be in Nashville, Tennessee. That conference attracts about 30,000 people, Bailey said. This is the first bitcoin-focused conference of its size in Asia in several years.\n\nAlex McShane, director of programming for the Bitcoin Conference, said the turnout in Hong Kong was still much higher than he expected. The company is now looking at options for the event next year. Bailey said the company is already in discussions with Hong Kong for returning to the city, with eyes on the coveted Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The event this year was held at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.\n\nTokyo and Singapore are also options for future Asia events, according to McShane.\n\nSome in the industry are hoping to regain a foothold in China, a market that was once a major centre of bitcoin activity. That evaporated almost overnight in 2021, when mainland authorities pushed out nearly all bitcoin mining activity, although much of that activity has since returned, albeit quietly.\n\nBen Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canada-based Bitfarms who used to run mining operations in China, said he hopes Hong Kong can be a “conduit for Chinese investors” to access bitcoin-related technologies – something he sees as possibly mitigating the impact of the real estate crash and stock market slump.\n\n“What I’m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to bitcoin and to the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that’s more safe, more controlled or regulated,” Gagnon said.\n\n“I hope that there’s going to be more pathways into mainland China,” he added.\n\nBesides the increasing financialisation of bitcoin, the asset’s price surge this year has also driven interest in layer 2 solutions. A layer 2 on a blockchain is a secondary network meant to help with scalability and efficiency, such as by offloading calculations to a secondary chain that is not as congested.\n\nChinese developers were spread across the main floor of Bitcoin Asia touting new companies building their own layer 2 networks.\n\n“There is an explosion of innovation happening in bitcoin right now,” Bailey said. “To go from, let’s call it 200 million bitcoiners in the world to 2 billion people in the world, we need to dramatically improve bitcoin scalability.”\n\nStill, while optimistic about the new opportunities cropping up in the space, he noted some similarities with previous rounds of bitcoin hype.\n\n“Some of these ideas are going to be famous companies a decade from now; some of these are gonna go to zero,” he said. “So it’s still the wild, wild west but … it’s now the wild west on layer 2 of bitcoin.”\n\n",

    "summary": "Crypto industry executives were touting the benefits of bitcoin at the four-day Web3 Festival amid anticipation for the approval of spot ETFs this month.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong’s biggest annual Web3 gathering concluded on Tuesday with industry executives looking to capitalise on the ballooning bitcoin price ahead of what is expected to be the city’s imminent approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the virtual asset this month.\n\nIndustry leaders attending the Hong Kong Web3 Festival shared extremely optimistic projections of the world’s largest cryptocurrency token, the price of which is up 58 per cent to about US$69,000 this year, as the crypto faithful hope to extend the winning streak.\n\nOn the opening day of the event on Saturday, US investor Cathie Wood made the bold prediction that the price of bitcoin was headed to US$1.5 million by 2030. Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Cobo, who uses the name Discus Fish in English, said on Tuesday that he thinks even the prediction of a 2,000 per cent increase in the next six years is “conservative”.\n\n\n\nWhile the conference touched on a range of topics, including real-world asset tokenisation and artificial intelligence, “bitcoin and its ecosystem projects” clearly took “centre stage” at the event, said Lily Z. King, chief operating officer of Cobo.\n\nThe excitement also partially stems from active development of so-called layer-2 bitcoin projects, which are networks that run alongside the main blockchain to help it scale through faster transactions. Many crypto firms see this as an opportunity to boost demand for businesses built around bitcoin.\n\nSpot ETFs are driving the most excitement, though, as it will give investors an easy way to expose themselves to bitcoin without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.\n\nMultiple people attending the event said they expect the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this month, following the approval of such funds in the US in January. Tencent News reported that the first batch could be announced as soon as April 15, with mainland Chinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) to be among the issuers.\n\nThe SFC recently approved Harvest and ChinaAMC to manage portfolios that invest more than 10 per cent in virtual assets, according to the regulator’s website.\n\nHong Kong regulators said in December that the city is prepared to allow retail access to ETFs that invest directly into cryptocurrencies and will start to authorise funds that offer such products.\n\nApart from traditional investors, Hong Kong’s bitcoin spot ETFs will be attractive to “crypto native players” because Hong Kong’s regime is currently the only one in the world that allows in-kind subscriptions, said Marco Lim, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund MaiCapital.\n\nUnder such arrangements, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem spot ETF shares, whereas in the US, these products can only be redeemed with dollars.\n\nThe introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs will be a “monumental stride” not only for the local market, but for the global perception of digital assets, said Cobo’s King. It represents a “significant leap” towards recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate alternative assets and will pave the way for widespread adoption, she added.\n\nExcitement is not just limited to bitcoin, though. Some at the Web3 Festival talked of the potential approval of spot ETFs for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. That is the other cryptocurrency that licensed exchanges can currently offer in Hong Kong.\n\nThat would make Hong Kong a first mover in the space, but it could be a harder sell for regulators. Some bitcoin ETF issuers in the US told CNBC this week that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject ether ETF applications.\n\n",

    "title": "Blockchain’s US woes no problem for Money20/20 Asia, where excitement is high\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain made up about 15 per cent of the talks at Money20/20 Asia this year, just slightly below the proportion of talks on AI, as interest remains high in Asia.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technologies emerged as an important trend at an Asia fintech conference this week, along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOut of the 139 talks and panels at the first Money20/20 in Bangkok – and the first in Asia since a show in Singapore in 2019 – 22 were directly related to blockchain, digital assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the event organisers. AI was still the most talked about tech topic, with 25 sessions in the fintech category directly addressing it.\n\nAsia’s strong interest in blockchain technologies marks a contrast to the US, where Money20/20 holds its flagship conference in Las Vegas. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s moves have dampened enthusiasm for Web3 in the world’s largest economy, conference attendees say, and focus has shifted largely to AI, an area in which the US has a leading position.\n\n\n\nIn Asia, “there’s still more of a focus on Web3, metaverse”, said Danny Levy, managing director of Money20/20 Asia. “We don’t see that at the other events. It’s not really a focus at all.”\n\nDaranee Saeju, assistant governor of the Payment Systems Policy and Financial Consumer Protection Group at the Bank of Thailand, discussed the potential transformative effects of blockchain for developing economies.\n\n“Imagine a world where payments are frictionless, borders are invisible, and money can move very fast, very cheap, convenient, secure and transparent,” Saeju said. “That’s the future we are researching here in Thailand.”\n\nShe mentioned Thailand’s participation in the mBridge project with mainland China, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates for trialling the sending of CBDC payments across borders using blockchain.\n\nJPMorgan announced at the show a partnership with Kasikornbank, one of Thailand’s largest banks, to launch Project Carina, which will allow for fast cross-border payments. The system works by transferring Q-money tied to the Thai Baht on Kasikornbank’s Quarix blockchain to JPMorgan’s JPM Coin on that bank’s Onyx blockchain. The goal is to reduce average transaction times from 72 hours to five minutes, the companies said.\n\n“Spending a lot of time with senior banking execs globally, blockchain is still a conversation now,” said Scarlett Sieber, chief strategy and growth officer at Money 20/20. The JPMorgan announcement comes after a decade of banks talking about working together on blockchain tech, she added.\n\nStablecoins were another big topic of conversation at the show, as companies prepare for coming regulations that could further legitimise the use of cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar (USD).\n\nRipple, which had a booth at the show, announced this month that it is launching its own USD-pegged stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger blockchain, created by the company, and Ethereum. “It’s about providing the option for another settlement currency easily through our network,” said Fiona Murray, managing director of Asia-Pacific (APAC) at Ripple.\n\nAs companies explore the opportunities in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, though, many of the opportunities for infrastructure and business-to-business companies like Ripple are in mature financial markets. Ripple’s biggest markets in APAC are Singapore, where it has its regional headquarters, Hong Kong and Australia, Murray said.\n\nAttendees from Hong Kong were also searching for what opportunities in Southeast Asia mean for the city that has been making a big push to become a Web3 and cryptocurrency hub.\n\n“You heard Bank of Thailand’s aspirations. That’s a lot,” Angelina Kwan, a Hong Kong-based senior adviser to IMC Asia-Pacific, said during a panel discussion about decentralised finance. “We should be worried in Singapore and Hong Kong, because Thailand wants to be a real leader in this area.”\n\nThe latest stage of Hong Kong’s push to formalise rules for the cryptocurrency industry involve a planned stablecoin regulation from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority that will require a licence to issue those products. RD Technologies, which exhibited at the conference, is one of the companies that has been planning to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nBeyond talk around blockchain and AI – which dealt with topics like fraud prevention and regulatory compliance – it was clear that less buzzy and more familiar technologies remain at the centre of the fintech business.\n\nA major theme of the show was financial inclusion. While some speakers touted the benefits of blockchain as a way of reaching and serving unbanked and underbanked populations – a big topic in Southeast Asia – others focused on more staid solutions.\n\nWeLab, which operates the virtual WeLab Bank in Hong Kong and recently started a new joint venture in Indonesia called Bank Saqu, has been looking at opportunities in Southeast Asia for expanding credit. “In Indonesia, the access to credit continues to be one of the biggest challenges,” said Jessica Lam, chief strategy officer at WeLab.\n\n\n\nWeLab, which also operates in mainland China, has sought for its online banks to be more nimble and agile than larger financial institutions, but it is still offering more traditional financial solutions than are typically found in discussions wrapped up in blockchain hype.\n\n“Buzzwords aside, I think it’s about relevance so far,” Lam said. “Is there a meaningful advantage that some of these new technologies and techniques bring? If so, we will incorporate them into our business.”\n\nMoney20/20 Asia returned for the first time in five years, but it switched locations. After cancelling its last Singapore show planned in 2020 because of Covid-19, it has now signed a three-year deal with Thailand to host the regional show in Bangkok.\n\nAttendance surpassed 3,000 people this year, the organisers said, in line with expectations and the 3,100 that attended the 2019 event in Singapore. The last events in Amsterdam and Las Vegas had more than two and three times the number of attendees, respectively, according to the organisers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong has approved preparations for the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world’s two largest cryptocurrency tokens, as the city looks to secure a leading position in the volatile virtual asset sector.\n\nMainland Chinese fund house Bosera Asset Management’s overseas arm and Hong Kong virtual asset firm HashKey Capital received “conditional approval” from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to jointly launch spot crypto ETFs, the companies said in announcements published online on Monday.\n\nChinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) are also among those to receive a green light, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin. ChinaAMC announced that it was working on those ETF products after receiving SFC approval to provide virtual asset management services.\n\n\n\nThe SFC, which first published rules for allowing spot crypto ETFs in December, was widely expected to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this week. The inclusion of spot ether ETFs makes it the first market in Asia, and the first global finance hub, to approve such a product. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved spot bitcoin ETFs, but it has delayed a decision on similar ether products.\n\nThe SFC has not made any announcement on the ETFs, as none have been officially approved yet. The conditional approval allows applicants to move forward with preparations to offer the funds, such as applying to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) to offer them on the local stock exchange.\n\n“The SFC issues a conditional authorisation letter to an ETF application if it generally satisfies our requirements, subject to various conditions, including fee payments, filing of documents and HKEX’s listing approval,” the SFC said in a statement to the Post, without clarifying the status of any spot crypto ETF applications.\n\nSpot crypto ETFs are considered a boon for investors who want exposure to such assets without needing to worry about setting up their own blockchain wallets or other technical details that can be a hurdle. ETFs can also be included in things like retirement funds, making them more appealing to mainstream investors.\n\nSince the US started allowing spot bitcoin ETFs this year, they have seen more than US$200 billion in trading volume, according to crypto news and data outlet The Block.\n\nBitcoin’s price has been surging since late last year, and especially after the US ETF approval in January. However, the price has fallen about 8 per cent in the past week to around US$66,700. After approving the spot ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned that bitcoin remains a “speculative, volatile asset”.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly delayed making a decision on ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. It is expected to conclude its review in late May.\n\nThat makes the approval in Hong Kong, which normally trails the US in approving such financial instruments, look more ambitious as the city seeks to transform itself into a virtual asset hub.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong market is relatively small, industry insiders say local spot crypto ETFs could be globally competitive because they allow for both cash and in-kind subscriptions – i.e. converting bitcoin or ether into their ETF equivalents. In the US, the products can only be purchased with dollars.\n\nThe in-kind arrangement offers benefits such as lower transactional costs and higher operational efficiencies, said Andrew Fei, a partner at King \u0026 Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\n\n“The approvals of the first spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs in Asia mark an important milestone in Hong Kong’s bid to become a global digital assets hub,” Fei said. “The strong crypto investor base in Asia, combined with the in-kind redemption feature and support for HK dollar trading, give these Hong Kong ETFs a real competitive edge.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Haldane.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong’s biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange operator, HashKey Group, has launched a new global trading platform that it hopes will help the company overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency exchange, HashKey Global, operates with a Digital Asset Business licence issued in Bermuda. It is now available globally with one big caveat: for regulatory reasons, certain markets like the US, mainland China and Hong Kong cannot use it, HashKey Group chief operating officer (COO) Livio Weng said in an interview on Saturday on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, a crypto conference organised by the company.\n\nThe company, established in Hong Kong in 2018, operates the local HashKey Exchange, which was approved by the city’s securities regulator last August to serve retail investors under the city’s new crypto regulatory regime. The exchange can so far only offer bitcoin and ether for retail trading.\n\n\n\nHashKey Exchange now has more than 170,000 registered users, Weng said on Saturday. It hosted about US$35 million in 24-hour trading volume on Monday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, which ranks the platform 15th according to a trust score that tries to measure legitimacy of trading data. However, HashKey’s volume is still a trickle compared with some of the world’s largest exchanges.\n\nBinance had US$6.3 billion in 24-hour normalised trading volume by mid-day on Monday, while OKX recorded more than US$2.1 billion, CoinGecko shows.\n\nHashKey is hoping that a new global exchange will supercharge its market position. Weng said the company intends to have more trading volume than Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, across all HashKey Group platforms by 2029.\n\n“We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult,” Weng said.\n\nThe global exchange could be particularly appealing to overseas Chinese and investors across Asian markets that do not block offshore crypto exchanges, according to the COO.\n\nFacing intense competition from existing crypto exchanges around the world, HashKey Global has an advantage as a compliant platform that also offers a smooth experience, Weng said.\n\nMost of the world’s major exchanges are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, he said.\n\nHashKey Group – whose businesses include the investment firm HashKey Capital and an asset-management arm – is among a range of cryptocurrency companies banking on Hong Kong’s embrace of the virtual asset industry.\n\nWhile public perception of the sector took a plunge last year following high-profile scandals – including the collapse of FTX in late 2022 and a local fraud involving the lesser known JPEX exchange a year later – confidence has rebounded in recent months after a surge in bitcoin prices in the new year. It hit a new record of more than US$73,000 last month.\n\nApart from a mandatory licensing regime for crypto exchanges, Hong Kong is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are also anticipating an imminent approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the city.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Trading could begin later this year, as the ETF issuers sill have to get the green light before launching the products.\n\n",
    "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved applications from Nasdaq, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of ether, potentially paving the way for the products to begin trading later this year.\n\nWhile the ETF issuers also have to get the green light before the products can launch, Thursday’s approval is a major surprise win for those firms and the cryptocurrency industry, which until Monday had expected the SEC to reject the filings.\n\nNine issuers including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock hope to launch ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency after the SEC in January approved bitcoin ETFs in a watershed moment for the industry.\n\n“This is an exciting moment for the industry at large,” said Andrew Jacobson, vice-president and head of legal at 21Shares, noting it was “a significant step” towards getting the products trading.\n\nThursday was the deadline for the SEC to decide on VanEck’s filing. Market participants were bracing for the thumbs-down because the SEC had not engaged with them on the applications.\n\nBut in a surprise move, SEC officials on Monday asked the exchanges to quickly fine-tune the filings, sending the industry scrambling to complete weeks of work in just days, sources said.\n\nReuters could not ascertain why the SEC appeared to have a change of heart.\n\n“The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has already demonstrated significant benefits for the digital assets and ETF space, and we believe that spot ether ETFs will similarly provide safeguards for US investors,” said Rob Marrocco, global head of exchange-traded product listings at Cboe Global Markets.\n\nNasdaq and NYSE declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked about the ether ETFs by reporters at an industry event earlier on Thursday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler – a crypto sceptic – declined to comment. An SEC spokesperson said in an email announcing the approval that the agency would not comment further.\n\nThe exchange applications had sought SEC approval for a rule change required to list new products, but the issuers still need the SEC to approve ETF registration statements detailing investor disclosures before they can start trading.\n\nUnlike the exchange filings, there is no set time frame in which the SEC has to decide on those statements. Industry participants said it was unclear how long that would take.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the process said many issuers are ready to launch, but the corporate finance division of the SEC has indicated it is likely to request changes and updates in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe SEC rejected spot bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade over market manipulation worries but was forced to approve them after Grayscale Investments won a court challenge last year.\n\nSui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, the index-provider for several of the bitcoin and ether ETFs, said ether is more complex than bitcoin and it could take months for the SEC to review the statements. But since the bitcoin ETFs offer an established template, “there’s only so much slow rolling” the SEC can do, he said.\n\nAn array of investors, including hedge funds, wealth advisers and retail investors, have poured more than US$30 billion into the crypto ETFs.\n\nThursday’s decision is another tailwind for cryptocurrency industry efforts to push into mainstream finance. This week the UK regulator also approved listed cryptocurrency products while the US House of Representatives passed a landmark bill seeking to provide regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile that bill still needs to pass the Senate, its extensive bipartisan support marks a major endorsement for the industry.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "HashKey will facilitate the sale and purchase of Toncoin, the native token of the TON blockchain, which was started by Telegram Messenger.\n\n",
    "content": "HashKey Group, operator of one of only two licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong, is teaming up with the operator of the blockchain created by Telegram Messenger to give users an on- and off-ramp by exchanging their so-called Toncoins for cash.\n\nThe agreement applies to users in the Asia-Pacific region and will see the two organizations work on “new ecosystem projects by providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and other incubation activities”, TON Foundation said in an announcement on Friday.\n\nThe foundation governing TON – an acronym that once stood for Telegram Open Network and now means simply The Open Network – was set up after Telegram was forced to abandon the blockchain because of a settlement with the US Securities and Futures Commission in 2020. The separate organisation has continued to develop the blockchain and later integrated it into Telegram through a mini app and business arrangements.\n\n“This is potentially quite massive,” TON Foundation president Steve Yun said. He referenced HashKey’s regulatory compliance as a way to help with know-your-customer (KYC) rules. “We do take strategic steps to make sure we follow the compliance requirements.”\n\n\n\nEven as TON has sought to keep itself separate from Telegram, the main utility of its blockchain remains tied to the popular messaging app, which has more than 900 million users globally, according to Yun. While anyone can build mini apps integrating other public blockchains into Telegram, the TON Foundation pays for premium real estate in the app, making it the default wallet option in the sidebar.\n\nHowever, TON is still grappling with regulatory issues. To avoid complications, it bars people in certain jurisdictions such as the US, China and Hong Kong from using the cryptocurrency function within Telegram.\n\nTelegram is blocked in mainland China, but the app became popular in Hong Kong during the 2019 anti-government protests. It has also become the messenger of choice for crypto enthusiasts. Despite its security issues compared with WhatsApp and Signal, features like broadcast channels and trading bots are popular in the community.\n\nTON is betting on the mini app ecosystem on Telegram as a means of driving adoption of its blockchain, which Yun said can scale better than most blockchains because of its use of sharding – a means of breaking up a blockchain into different segments.\n\nGreater adoption means more users will be looking for ways to convert their tokens to cash and vice versa. TON also sees Asia as a natural fit because they are already used to the “super app” concept, according to Yun, hence the team-up with HashKey in the region.\n\n“Where in the world do [people] know how to build mini apps as part of a super app? Not many places,” Yun said. “Eastern Europe because VK is popular. [Asia-Pacific] because of Line, Kakao and WeChat.”\n\nThe agreement also adds to HashKey’s recent expansion efforts. The Hong Kong-based company became the second licensed crypto exchange operator in the city in 2022, nearly two years after BC Technology Group, which operates the OSL exchange.\n\nDuring the Web3 Festival, which HashKey organised, the company on Monday launched a global crypto exchange. TON was also a major sponsor of the festival, where it held several talks and events.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission upgraded HashKey’s licence to allow the company to sell crypto-related investment products to retail investors. It has already been selling bitcoin and ether on its retail-facing platform that it launched in November.\n\nThe local crypto firm known today mostly just in Hong Kong has been looking to transform itself into a major international player. Livio Weng, the chief operating officer, said this week that HashKey intends to surpass Coinbase in trading volume by 2030. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, currently has around 30 times the 24-hour trading volume of HashKey.\n\nTeaming with TON foundation offers it a different avenue to scale than Coinbase, which has seen its fortunes rise with the popularity of bitcoin since its founding 12 years ago. HashKey is just half that age.\n\nIf Toncoin becomes popular through its integration with Telegram and its myriad mini apps, as the TON Foundation is betting on, then HashKey could suddenly find itself with millions of potential new users across Asia as it facilitates the default medium of exchange on one of the world’s most popular messenger apps.\n\n",

    "content": "Asia’s first exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in bitcoin and ether started trading in Hong Kong on Tuesday with early gains in morning trading, marking a significant move in the city’s effort to become a cryptocurrency hub.\n\nSix spot crypto ETFs that invest in the world’s two largest cryptocurrency tokens debuted on the Hong Kong stock exchange, launched by mainland Chinese fund managers ChinaAMC, Harvest International, and Bosera Asset Management, which is teaming with HashKey Capital, the investment arm of Hong Kong crypto firm HashKey Group.\n\nChinaAMC and Harvest’s bitcoin ETFs closed up about 1.5 per cent each, while Borsera’s closed up 1.8 per cent. All three ether ETFs closed down less than 1 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs saw nearly HK$67 million (US$9.2 million) in trading volume by the end of the day, with ChinaAMC’s ETF seeing the most trading with about HK$37 million changing hands.\n\nHong Kong’s launch of new crypto ETFs, seen as offering some advantages for investors in Asia compared with similar products in the US that are much bigger in scale, will test the city’s progress in its pursuit of becoming a hub for virtual asset businesses.\n\nThe six Hong Kong funds racked up nearly HK$87 million by the close of trading. In comparison, 11 bitcoin ETFs in the US, which debuted in January, saw more than US$4.6 billion traded on their first day.\n\nHong Kong could expect the trading volume of its spot crypto ETFs to reach 20 per cent of those in the US within about a year, HashKey Group chief operating officer Livio Weng said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nMarket makers likely contributed the bulk of first-day trading, so it remains to be seen how demand for these products will hold up in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFund managers and brokerages are dangling favourable policies to draw investors, with Harvest waiving its management fee for six months and Bosera for four months. Online Chinese brokerage Tiger Brokers said in a statement on Monday that it is offering platform fee exemptions for the first batch of these ETFs.\n\nGiven the Hong Kong ETF market’s diminutive size compared with the US, the funds are hoping to draw investors looking for products offered specifically in Asia.\n\nNon-Hong Kong residents can purchase shares in the crypto ETFs as long as they pass local know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, HashKey Capital said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWhile that means the ETFs are technically available to mainland Chinese investors who have Hong Kong bank or brokerage accounts, investing in these products could still be difficult because mainland identity cards may not be able to pass brokerage platforms’ KYC procedures, said one industry insider who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nBeijing has strictly banned commercial cryptocurrency trading on the mainland. Other types of ETFs can already be traded through the Stock Connect scheme that links to markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nHong Kong regulators at the launch event on Tuesday morning, which included a bell-ringing ceremony, cautioned that there are high risks involved in the crypto-based products despite the successful listings.\n\n“Our approval for virtual asset ETFs does not equate to us supporting the relevant virtual assets or us encouraging the public to invest in them,” Christina Choi Fung Yee, executive director of investment products at the Securities and Futures Commission, said during the ceremony. “Virtual assets are extremely speculative with highly volatile prices … I’d like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors.”\n\n",

Their older computers may still bring a profit, just not likely in the US.\n\n“It’s a natural migration” with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world where power is the cheapest, said SunnySide Digital chief executive officer Taras Kulyk, who has resold US computers to miners in countries such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay and Uruguay. “This is accelerated by the halving.”\n\nSome 600,000 S19 series computers, which account for a majority of machines currently in use, are moving out of the US mostly to Africa and South America, according to an estimate by Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology in Seattle.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, specialised machines are used to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn operators a fixed token reward.\n\nAnonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto baked in the once-every-four-years halving to maintain the hard cap of 21 million tokens. Next month’s event is the fourth since 2012 and the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoin from 6.25 now.\n\nBitcoin has surged about 50 per cent this year to around US$63,500, though it is down from a record high of US$73,798 reached on March 14.\n\nBringing more efficient machines online has become more urgent with the halving just weeks away, as continued use of older equipment could mean electricity costs will be close to or exceed mining revenue.\n\nWhile S19 series and similar models might not be profitable to run in the US after the halving, they “can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in parts of Africa, said Jaran Mellerud, CEO at Dubai-based Hashlabs Mining, which leases data centre space in Ethiopia and provides hosting services to bitcoin miners.\n\nSome buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more, said Lauren Lin, Luxor’s business development director.\n\nThe used S19 models cost about US$7,030 in March 2022, according to Luxor, which runs a trading desk for used machines. The price dropped dramatically a year later to about US$900 as bitcoin prices sank, then to about US$427 this month and is estimated to sell for about US$356 in May, after the halving.\n\nThere are miners in the US opting not to sell their hardware and instead transfer the equipment to regions with lower electricity costs and third-party data centres. Nuo Xu, who has two sites in Texas, is travelling this month to Ethiopia, Nigeria and a few other countries to scope out locations for about 6,000 older computers.\n\n“There are more risks for my machines in Africa but I have to move them there,” he said. “Cheaper electricity outside the US means it will take a much shorter time to recover the overhead costs,” with labour and building materials also much less expensive, he said.\n\nMiners globally who do not have their own facilities pay a hosting fee, which typically includes electricity, labour and third-party operators.\n\nIt has been Xu’s experience that fees in the US come to about 7 US cents per kilowatt hour. In Ethiopia, which has loosened regulations on crypto mining and increased its power generation, the rate is about 5 US cents, according to Hashlab’s Mellerud. That two-cent difference is huge for miners.\n\nElectricity itself is about 3 US cents per kWh in Ethiopia, according to Hiwot Eshetu, marketing and business development director at Ethiopian Electric Power. In the US, the range is about 3 US cents to 6 US cents, based on estimates from Luxor.\n\n“Ethiopia is really becoming a big player in the digital mining ecosystem,” said SunnySide’s Kulyk, who added his company is negotiating a deal to help move between 20,000 and 40,000 rigs to the east African nation.\n\n\n\nNot all US-based equipment leaves the country. That process can be tougher for publicly traded companies because they have to take risk-averse shareholders into account. There is also some hesitation to relocate machines abroad due to transport costs, breakage and security concerns.\n\nPublicly traded Bit Digital, one of the biggest bitcoin miners, has older generations of computers sitting dormant in a warehouse in Houston.\n\n“These machines basically collect dust every now and again,” said CEO Sam Tabar. But the New York-based company holds onto them because when bitcoin prices are high, the computers can be pulled out of retirement and still make a profit, he said.\n\nMiners have been prepping for the halving for years and are spending big bucks to replace their older hardware.\n\nThe 13 major public bitcoin-mining companies, including Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, have placed orders for more than US$1 billion worth of machines since February 2023, according to crypto-mining researcher TheMinerMag.\n\nFive of the biggest miners raised more than US$2.7 billion from selling shares in the two years ended in December. Since the start of this year, those same miners have raked in an additional US$840 million, according to the researcher.\n\n",

A better understanding of the reasons for which Bitcoin wallets might be lost can help you prevent such losses. In addition, it can also help you find the best ways to restore your lost assets. Here are the common reasons for which you can lose Bitcoin wallets.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of accessing your Bitcoin wallet is the private key. Private keys are strings of characters that are unique to each wallet and can help access and manage Bitcoin. Most of the people who ask questions like “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” are troubled by the problem of losing their private keys. Losing your private key is similar to losing the keys to your safe. An individual can lose their private keys due to data corruption, forgetfulness, or hardware failure. Therefore, it is important to follow safe storage practices to safeguard your private keys.\n\nThe death of a Bitcoin wallet owner also presents a formidable challenge to the world of digital assets. If the Bitcoin wallet owner has not implemented any measures for estate planning to transfer private key information, then their Bitcoin wallet might become completely inaccessible. It creates difficulty for Bitcoin wallet recovery, as highlighted in various examples. Therefore, it is important to include cryptocurrencies in estate planning or choose Dead Man’s switches for crypto.\n\nAnyone can send Bitcoins to the wrong address by mistake. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover the assets from your wallet. Therefore, you should double-check the transaction details before sending Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin wallets can be inaccessible when they are used as burn wallets. The primary purpose of burning wallets is to remove coins from circulation. You cannot think of methods to recover Bitcoin wallet passwords for burn wallets as they don’t offer scope for retrieval. Bitcoin is sent to burn wallets with the intention of making them permanently inaccessible.\n\nBitcoin wallets can become dormant when they have not been utilized in any transaction for a long period. There are different reasons for which Bitcoin wallets can become dormant, such as owners losing interest in Bitcoin. Dormant wallets can indicate the removal of Bitcoin from active circulation, which enhances its scarcity.\n\nBitcoin wallets are not immune to theft. You might have to find ways to restore Bitcoin wallet when you fall victim to Bitcoin theft. Cybercriminals and hackers use different types of tactics to lay their hands on your Bitcoin wallets. For example, they can use social engineering attacks to trick users into entering their private keys.\n\nCentralized exchanges are the popular choices among Bitcoin wallets that offer custodial solutions without any burden of managing your Bitcoins. However, the problem with centralized exchanges is that they can freeze your wallets anytime. For example, centralized exchanges can freeze the accounts that are suspected of being involved in malicious activity. In such cases, legitimate users might also lose access to their Bitcoin wallets due to potential security breaches by hackers or mistakes in flagging errors.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n\nThe search for lost Bitcoin wallets can lead you to different answers, which are generally confusing. It is important to remember that Bitcoin wallets are not like your physical wallets, where you can store your bank cards and cash. You must learn about Bitcoin wallet backup restore features only with an in-depth understanding of public and private keys. However, human error can creep in somewhere, and you may end up giving away your private keys or forgetting that you even have a wallet.\n\nIf you don’t remember where you have stored your Bitcoin wallet, you can look for your wallet data on your computer or storage devices. The wallet file is available as ‘wallet.dat,’ and it includes your transaction history, private keys, and public keys. You can begin your Bitcoin wallet recovery by learning about the methods to find the wallet file. Here is an outline of the steps you can follow to retrieve your wallet file on different operating systems.\n\nPress Win+F.\n\nEnter “wallet.dat” in the search window. Make sure that you don’t include the quotation marks.\n\nNow, visit the “Programs and Components” section to find programs with the term ‘Bitcoin’ in their name.\n\nYou can use the Finder on macOS to look for the directory “~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat” in it.\n\nIn addition, you should also look for text files that have the terms ‘Bitcoin,’ ‘key,’ ‘password,’ ‘BTC,’ and ‘wallet’ in their names.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe recovery of a Bitcoin wallet might seem like an almost impossible task. If you don’t find the wallet file, you are more likely to be frustrated about losing your valuable assets. It is true that you can recover Bitcoin wallet password only after facing a lot of challenges. Here are some of the methods you can try to retrieve your lost Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe first step to recovering your Bitcoin wallet is to know the type of Bitcoin wallet you want to recover. You may have selected a web wallet for convenience or a hardware wallet for security. Some people also choose paper wallets for simplicity or mobile wallets to access their crypto assets from anywhere. The answers to “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” might suggest that you should look for transaction history on Blockchain Explorer.\n\nIt can help you find clues about the wallet address and the type of wallet you used for the transaction. On top of it, you can also use known addresses in Bitcoin transactions to identify the type of wallet. Every wallet type has unique methods for recovery, implying the necessity of finding the correct wallet.\n\nPaper wallets are simple tools to store your private keys, as you can just write them down on a piece of paper and store them somewhere safe. However, if you lose a paper wallet, there is a very slim chance of recovery. You cannot restore Bitcoin wallet in paper form. All you can do is look for a second copy of the paper wallet or the wallet file on your device.\n\nCrypto exchanges offer custodial wallets to hold and trade your cryptocurrencies. You must start by identifying the crypto exchange you used to store your Bitcoin. Custodial wallets on crypto exchanges allow users to access their wallets through traditional methods, such as email addresses and passwords.\n\nTherefore, the Bitcoin wallet recovery for such wallets involves checking your email inbox to find your login credentials. You can follow the password recovery process of the crypto exchange and restore access to your Bitcoin account. However, you cannot follow this process when the crypto exchange has blocked your account.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nYou can recover a software wallet by finding the device on which you used the wallet. It is possible that you may have saved your private keys on multiple files on your computer. You can also check anything that can store your private keys, such as USB drives. Another important answer to “How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?” in the case of software wallets is the seed phrase. You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet.\n\nIf you don’t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the ‘wallet.dat’ file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions.\n\nYou can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it.\n\nWithout the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet. At the same time, it is also important to remember that top hardware wallet devices offer advanced security features, making them completely immune to physical hacking.\n\nStart learning about cryptocurrencies with world’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts!\n\nThe responses to queries about recovering Bitcoin wallets offer a ray of hope for people who think that they have lost their Bitcoin forever. Since Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no way you can turn to the law or governments to recover Bitcoin wallets. On top of that, the journey to recover Bitcoin wallet password is a difficult one. However, you can try out different methods to restore your Bitcoin wallet according to the type of wallet you use.\n\nFor example, you can use your email inbox to find login credentials for your software wallet.

    "content": "Digital technologies such as Deep Learning and Machine Learning have taken the world by storm. Although these technologies are in their nascent stage, they have shown immense potential. The emergence of these technological concepts is a boon for individuals and businesses alike. Today, it has become a necessity to gain insight into the technologies that are revolutionizing our lives.\n\nHowever, if you want to understand these technologies at a comprehensive level, you need to familiarize yourself with not only the unique concepts but also the differences that exist between them. For someone who wants to have a promising career in the competitive IT industry, it is essential to know how concepts such as DL and ML are influencing the trajectory of AI. Before understanding the deep learning vs machine learning difference, it is essential to have a clear knowledge of the respective technological concepts.\n\n\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is a subdomain of Artificial Intelligence technology. ML primarily focuses on the creation of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn. Thanks to ML, computers can make decisions or predictions without the need to explicitly program them.\n\nThus, Machine Learning involves training algorithms to support the identification of relationships and patterns. Ultimately, such patterns help make predictions about new data. In simple words, ML is the type of Artificial Intelligence that relies on minimum human interference.\n\nSome of the chief features of Machine Learning are:\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nDeep Learning is a part of Machine Learning. It makes use of neural networks with diverse layers to analyze complex associations and patterns in data. It is capable of mimicking the human brain to carry out a broad range of tasks, such as speech recognition as well as natural language processing. One of the main highlights of Deep Learning models is that they are capable of learning. Hence, they can improve over time, and their level of accuracy can improve as they process data.\n\nSome of the chief features of Deep Learning are:\n\nAlthough to a layman, the terms Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning may sound similar. The reality is that each of these concepts is different from one another. However, they are related to each other. Now that you have clarity on deep learning and machine learning concepts, it is time to answer the following question: What are the differences between deep learning and machine learning?\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nThere exist a number of deep learning vs machine learning differences. By identifying how the technological concepts are unique, it is possible to identify their true potential.\n\nMachine Learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence. Since it is trained on statistical models and algorithms, it is capable of making predictions. The technology relies on historical data as well as training to strengthen its capabilities. A key thing to bear in mind is that ML relies on human intervention so that data can be fed and improvements can be made.\n\nDeep Learning can be defined as the subset of Machine Learning technology. It is a model that can help an algorithm ascertain whether a prediction is accurate or not. The role of neural networks is indispensable in Deep Learning. As neural networks empower software to comprehend complex patterns, there is no need for human intervention.\n\nThe difference between machine learning and deep learning arises from the use of data representation. In the case of machine learning, the data representation that is used is quite different from that of deep learning. In Machine Learning, structured data is used. This type of data is highly valuable since it can be searched and analyzed in a simple and efficient manner. ML techniques may find it challenging to work on unstructured data. This is due to the fact that the training dataset may have infinite variations.\n\nThe data representation that is used in Deep Learning is different as it involves neural networks. DL is capable of working with not only structured data but also with unstructured data. The technology can be used for a broad range of unstructured data such as images, audio, text as well as tables containing data.\n\nThe values that are arranged in structures are known as data points. Machine Learning encompasses thousands of data points, whereas Deep Learning involves millions of data points. This feature goes on to show that Machine Learning is capable of working well with relatively small databases. On the other hand, Deep Learning relies on a humongous volume of data while carrying out its task. DL basically requires large amounts of data so that it can understand and perform tasks better than conventional ML algorithms.\n\n\n\nWhile exploring deep learning vs machine learning, a key difference that arises is related to the training time. Training time is basically the time that is taken by a model for the purpose of training on a dataset. When it comes to ML algorithms, they require less time for training. The training time may range between a few seconds to a number of hours. However, the same is not the case when it comes to Deep Learning. The training time for a Deep Learning neural network may span between a few hours to several weeks. However, it may be possible to adopt certain methods to hasten the training time.\n\nWhen it comes to Machine Learning, it may be possible to set up and run the system in no time. However, although it may be easy to set up the system, it does not mean that its effectiveness is guaranteed. In fact, the effectiveness of the system may be hampered. On the contrary, setting up Deep Learning may seem time-consuming, but there is no compromise on the effectiveness of the system. Once the system is up and running, there is a need for limited or no intervention. It is capable of generating results in an effective manner. Moreover, the quality of the outcome is likely to get better with the passage of time.\n\nThe resources that are required for ML systems and DL systems may vary considerably. It is possible to execute Machine Learning on simple and standard computer systems. As ML does not require a large volume of computational power, it can be supported by a standard computer. However, the same cannot be said about deep Learning.\n\nDeep Learning systems require powerful hardware and software resources so that they can function properly. As DL involves a broad number of operations, it needs a robust system that can support it. In the absence of appropriate resources, the efficiency and functionality of DL may be diminished.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges?

    "content": "Solana is one of the most popular blockchain networks right now, with a formidable potential for powering web3 solutions. It offers a highly scalable and interoperable blockchain network with the flexibility for creating advanced smart contracts suited to diverse use cases. The review of working mechanism of Solana draws attention to the Solana validator roles and responsibilities in the network.\n\nThe role of validators in blockchain network revolves around verification of blockchain transactions and maintaining security of the ledger. Validators serve a crucial role in Proof of Stake blockchains by staking their assets and showing confidence in the potential of a blockchain network. Is the role of validators different in Solana? Let us learn more about the responsibilities of validators and how they work with the unique highlights of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nSolana validators are computers that help in running the Solana network. The first addition to Solana validator responsibilities is the execution of programs for tracking all accounts on the Solana cluster. Validators also ensure validation of transactions incorporated on the network, and any type of transaction on Solana is impossible without validators.\n\nAs more independent entities participate in running validators, the cluster becomes less vulnerable to any disruption that could influence it. Validators serve a major role in growing the Solana network and get a first-hand impression of the workings of Solana cluster functions. In addition, Solana validators also become an important part of the community responsible for the growth of Solana ecosystem.\n\nWhat would Solana validators gain from their contributions to the Solana ecosystem? You can find the details of Solana validator rewards by uncovering the significance of staking. It is the process for active engagement of a user in validating transactions. Staking can be considered as the alternative to mining, albeit with consumption of limited resources.\n\nThe working mechanism of staking involves locking the native asset of a blockchain network in a smart contract for maintenance of operations and security of the blockchain network. Validators ensure that a blockchain network has access to funds required for network maintenance and receive rewards for their contribution. In simple words, staking involves a contribution to security and maintenance of a blockchain network in return for rewards.\n\nEnroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens.\n\nAnother important highlight in the description of the working of Solana is the combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of History. You can find answers to ‘What Solana validators do?’ by exploring the details of the two mechanisms. Proof of Stake is one of the important terms in the blockchain landscape, as it offers an efficient approach to transaction validation on a blockchain network.\n\nIt is a credible alternative to Proof of Work for verifying and adding new blocks to a blockchain network. Validators are an important component in Proof of Stake blockchains as they stake tokens in the network. The number of tokens that a validator stakes in a Proof of Stake blockchain would determine the chances of picking them up for validation.\n\nSolana presents promising potential for empowering web3 solutions by using a unique take on consensus mechanisms. You can understand Solana validator roles and responsibilities more clearly by exploring the details of Proof of History. The Proof of History consensus mechanism involves implementation of a cryptographic clock on a trustless network for synchronization of nodes.\n\nProof of History utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and creates a rhythmic clock that measures creation of blocks with the exact time when they were created. It accounts for the factor of delay in time required for predicting the outcome of an algorithm. With Proof of History, the blockchain network could make safe assumptions about time passing with every block.\n\n\n\nProof of Work blockchain networks utilize massive amounts of energy as a measure of the effort for including transactions in a block. It is useful for ensuring that a blockchain network does not produce multiple new valid blocks. Most of the work in Proof of Work revolves around preventing the problems of double-spending. Proof of Work ensures physical constraints on software for providing security in hostile environments.\n\nThe critical review of the roles of Solana validator would draw attention towards the slow speed of Proof of Work. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work and serves as an alternative to physical cash. However, modern global markets do not revolve around physical cash, and Proof of Work would have the same impact as transporting cash physically from one back to the other.\n\nIn the new age of digital advancements, Proof of Stake also falls behind in terms of transaction speed. For example, DeFi transactions require faster processing alongside demanding effective arrangement of global events in a sequence facilitated by Proof of History. Validators in Proof of History must agree on the sequence of events in the past rather than using a single point of time to confirm transactions.\n\nIn this case, blocks would not be measured in terms of memory space as they use periods, which implies that you can break down a span of time infinitely. The Proof of Stake in Solana blockchain only introduces a security layer for the network and provides rewards to honest participants alongside punishing malicious agents.\n\nLearn about blockchain technology fundamentals, use cases, enterprise blockchain platforms, BAAS vendors with Blockchain for Enterprise E-Book\n\nYou can find more insights on Solana validator roles and responsibilities by exploring the working mechanisms of Solana validators. The primary role of validators revolves around management of the chaos in transactions that happen thousands of times per second. Validators offer a precise accounting of events through addition of data by using a hashing algorithm to prove the passage of time.\n\nThe Solana validator ensures that a specific transaction has happened after and before specific points or hashes in time. Validators who monitor the transactions on Solana blockchain would have to pay a voting fee to confirm the transactions. Every participant on Solana blockchain would get the opportunity to submit a block and obtain the required rewards.\n\nIt is important to decode the Solana validator responsibilities with a comprehensive explanation of the working of Solana validators. You must note that validators in Solana don’t generate and traditionally add blocks. The significance of block production is evident in the creation of a universal record of the passage of time.\n\nWith the help of Proof of Stake rules, lead validators have to arrange the transactions they receive and add them to one of the hashes. On the other hand, observing validators must vote and validate the record of events. In Solana blockchain, more than 66% of validators must vote to ensure confirmation of a block.\n\nStart learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Skill Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nSome of you might have doubts regarding the role of validators in Proof of History. It is important to note that Proof of History might be a revolutionary approach for organizing a blockchain. However, it is not an independent consensus mechanism like Proof of Stake. You can understand the roles of Solana validator as important components with the nature of Solana as a Proof of Stake network.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana presents a major difference from other Proof of Stake blockchains, which do not have any official minimum limit for staking. However, validators must stake an adequate amount of SOL tokens for processing the voting fees, which is almost 1 SOL daily.\n\nThe actual initial investment required to become a Solana validator is the required hardware. If you want to reap the Solana validator rewards, then you need a machine and stable network connection for managing all transactions on the Solana network. However, the initial investment in the machines would gradually become cheaper with the passage of time as hardware becomes more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nSolana has presented multiple complaints about network congestion in recent times. Bots capitalize on the cost-effectiveness of transactions on Solana and radical growth in popularity, thereby populating the network with unnecessary traffic. Using Solana network is similar to using Ethereum in the early days.\n\nThe answers to “What Solana validators do?” would require an overview of how DeFi works. In the initial days of DeFi, Ethereum served as the top choice for creating new DeFi solutions and helped in revolutionizing the domain of financial services. However, the growing popularity of DeFi increased more transactions on Ethereum and led to the rise in ETH gas fees.\n\nIt is important to note that DeFi strategies that need high-frequency trades, such as flash loans, selling NFTs, and arbitrage in volatile markets, are vulnerable. Solana has been tailored to manage all types of DeFi transactions. However, DeFi could encounter problems in situations when bots can duplicate transactions and send all of them at a time to one validator.\n\nThe transactions are a part of one type of DDoS attack and work by flooding the network. Just like other blockchain networks, validators on Solana have been tailored for managing a fork for a short duration of time. Validators must carry out the fork until the network achieves consensus between validators on the actual blockchain. Congestion is one of the formidable problems of Solana networks, as it could crash validators or isolate them from infrastructure.\n\n\n\nYes, Solana has experienced network congestion to such an extent that it had to experience a network halt. The network halt lasted for almost seven hours. In April 2022, Solana experienced a network halt lasting for seven hours. You can find another side of Solana validator responsibilities by understanding the impact of the biggest network halt on Solana. Validators struggled to keep up with almost 6 million transactions each second.\n\nThe massive volume of transactions led to generation of traffic of more than 100 Gbps for individual nodes. As a result, validators crashed and blocked the voting process. The network halt itself is only a part of the problem. The aftereffects of the crash include validators struggling to restart and evaluate the chain of events to reach a consensus on where the network had been through disruption.\n\nThe importance of Solana validator roles and responsibilities is clearly visible in how they maintain and manage the network. Validators on Solana blockchain are responsible for running a node at all times. The Solana blockchain depends on effective validation of transactions. Therefore, validators must have optimal involvement in the network to ensure that all blocks can work effectively. Apart from maintenance of nodes, Solana validators must also participate in governance and community proposals.\n\nAs a result, they play a crucial role in determining the course of Solana ecosystem development. Solana is the next generation of Proof of Stake networks, which permit on-chain governance. Therefore, validators must vote on the upgrades and parameters of the network. For example, validators voted on the proposal to enable inflation on the Solana mainnet beta in February 2021.\n\nSolana’s dependence on validators provides a clear impression of how they manage the Solana network. What do validators receive in return for their effort? Entities that become validators would receive financial returns and rewards for their contributions to the Solana network. The distribution of Solana validator rewards involves distinct ways, such as staking rewards, commission on staking rewards, and transaction fees.\n\nWhen delegators earn rewards with the help of validators, the validators will receive a share of rewards. Validators could also earn rewards for their stakes invested in the network. Another notable way in which validators receive reward points at transaction fees. Validators receive a share of the transaction fees charged for every transaction on the Solana network.\n\nStart learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nSolana validators are an important part of the Solana ecosystem, as they help in building the core foundations of Solana. The review of Solana validator roles and responsibilities shows that they are important for managing transactions on Solana blockchain. They are also responsible for maintaining the network.\n\nSolana validators are also responsible for maintaining security and governance in the Solana network.

    "content": "Today, blockchain technology acts as one of the most promising concepts that has come into existence.\n\nIt is basically a database mechanism that supports the transparent sharing of information via a business network. The emergence of the technology has made it possible to record as well as track transactions within a business network. The capabilities and properties of blockchain have significantly contributed to its rising popularity in the online community.\n\nNow, the main question that you may have in your mind is – What is the link between a Solana Smart Contract and blockchain? The answer to the question is simple. Solana is a blockchain that has a number of similarities with Ethereum. In order to understand the true potential of a Solana smart contract, you need to become familiar with Solana. The guide will help you broaden your knowledge of Solana and Solana Smart Contracts.\n\n\n\nSolana is a blockchain platform, and its ultimate purpose involves the hosting of decentralized applications. The platform makes use of a ‘proof of history’ (PoH) along with a ‘proof of stake’ (PoS) consensus mechanism. The PoH mechanism allows the timestamping of transactions and supports efficient verification. On the other hand, the PoS mechanism allows validators to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is capable of processing a large number of transactions per second in comparison to its rival, Ethereum. The fact that it charges much lower fees than its rival makes it immensely popular and in demand in the blockchain community. One of the main highlights of Solana is that its algorithms help in removing performance obstacles relating to blockchain software. This property makes it highly secure, scalable, and decentralized. Now that you are familiar with Solana blockchain, it is time to dive deeper and learn about Solana smart contracts.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n\nA Solana smart contract refers to a contract that is run on the Solana network. In case your question is not yet answered, you need to look at Solana and smart contracts separately. As already highlighted, Solana is a blockchain platform. A smart contract is a program that is stored on a blockchain network. These programs are capable of executing predefined actions. The execution can take place as soon as the necessary predefined conditions have been met.\n\nSmart contracts are of immense value since they help in the automation of agreements between two or more participants. In smart contracts, codes play a key role as they mediate such contracts. As a result, participants do not have to worry about the involvement of any third parties or intermediaries. Moreover, they do not have to worry about incurring unnecessary losses. Solana smart contracts have gained massive popularity as they combine the benefits of the Solana blockchain and the smart contract concept.\n\nExcited to learn about the fundamentals of Solana and Solana smart contracts development, Enroll now in the Solana Development Course.\n\nIn order to create Solana smart contract, you need to first get familiar with the architecture of Solana Smart Contract. You must note that the smart contract model in Solana is different from the conventional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enabled blockchain. The traditional model fuses logic or code as well as state into one contract whose deployment takes place on-chain. On the other hand, Solana’s smart contract exists in a stateless or read-only mode. Moreover, it only contains the program logic component.\n\nAfter the deployment of a Solana smart contract, its accessibility is possible through external accounts. These external accounts are responsible for interacting with the program for the purpose of storing program interaction-specific data. As a result, there is a distinction between the state and the contact logic. Besides, you must note that the Solana blockchain stores data in the form of wallet information, unlike Ethereum.\n\nSolana comes with a command line interface, also known as CLI and JSON RPC application programming interface. These elements play a chief role in enhancing the decentralized application’s (DApp) interaction with Solana. In addition, the DApp can utilize the existing software development kit to interact with the programs on the Solana blockchain.\n\nAre you aspiring to learn the fundamentals of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and smart contracts’ upgradability? Enroll now in the Advanced Solidity Development Course.\n\nThe program, which represents the first development workflow, is fundamental to build Solana Smart Contract. It enables users to create as well as deploy custom Rust, C + +, and C programs on the Solana blockchain. After the deployment of these programs, anyone with a solid knowledge of programming can use them.\n\nIf you have solid programming skills, you can definitely use them. To communicate with the programs, you must write DApp. It can be done by using any software development kit client at hand. Then, you can use the JSON RPC application programming interface for internal workings.\n\nThe second development workflow involves the client, where users can write DApp. DApp can be used for the purpose of communication with the deployed programs. These apps are responsible for the submission of transactions to the programs through the software development kit client. Furthermore, it can create a diverse range of applications, such as decentralized exchanges, client wallets, etc.\n\nBoth the first and the second development workflow, i.e., program and client, function cohesively. By working together, they are able to form a comprehensive network of DApps as well as programs. It facilitates the interaction for updating the state and examining the blockchain.\n\nWant to know the real-world examples of smart contracts and understand how you can use it for your business? Check the presentation Now on Examples Of Smart Contracts\n\nIn order to build Solana smart contracts, you need to adopt a systematic approach. You do not need to rush to learn the process, as it may confuse you. However, by following the simple step-by-step guidance you can broaden your insight into Solana smart contract language and become a pro when it comes to building smart contracts.\n\nBefore building Solana smart contracts, the first thing that you must do involves setting up a Solana environment. In the section, the Solana smart contract example that is presented is Hello World. It is a Rust program that can write its output to the console.\n\nFor some people, the direct running of a smart contract code from Windows may get confusing or overwhelming. If you also do not feel comfortable, you need not have to worry. An easier option is to set up the Ubuntu version of the window subsystem of the Linux operating system. By taking this step, you will be able to write the code in the Windows OS, and later, you can put together the Rust smart contract into a .so file. You need to give the necessary commands for setting up the ideal environment for the Solana smart contract deployment. Then, you need to run the Hello World app for testing purposes.\n\nIn this step, you have to use the Rust programming language to create Solana smart contracts. Some of the requisites that are needed for the process include Solana CLI v1.7.11 or the later version, the latest stable Rust build, NodJS version 14 or higher, and Git. These installations are fundamental for proceeding in your journey of building Solana smart contracts.\n\nSince the example that is given involves Hello World, you need to broaden your insight into it. Hello World is a smart contract or software that can log in to the console. In addition, it can count the total number of times the Hello World application is used for a specific account. Besides, it can store the exact number on-chain. To help you grasp the concept better, the explanation is given in a simple and comprehensible manner.\n\nYou need to use standard Solana programming parameters. It will help you to establish the very starting point of the program. In addition to this function, the specific portion helps serialize as well as deserialize arguments, passing them to and from the deployed application. This is possible with the help of BORSH or Binary Object Representation Serializer for Hashing. You need to give the appropriate command for the configuration of the HelloWorld Software.\n\nAfter the completion of the process, the starting point, i.e., the process instruction function, will receive the program ID. The program ID is basically a public key that contains the specific location of the program’s deployment. Moreover, it contains the accounting parameter. This parameter is responsible for specifying the account to which the program must say hello.\n\nThe core logic of the program lies in the ‘Programresult’ class. It is responsible for generating a notice in such a situation. Moreover, it also chooses the appropriate account from the ‘accounts.’ In the specific example, a single account will be used. Subsequently, the application can assess whether it has the authority to edit data that is related to the particular account. In the end, the code is able to retrieve the number that is stored for the existing account. It also increases it by one unit and then writes the result, after which a message is displayed.\n\nExcited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nNow that you know how to build a Solana smart contract, you may be asking yourself – How do I deploy a smart contract on Solana? The answer is fairly simple. The initial step for initiating the deployment of the contract involves the cloning of the repository. After all the processes have come to an end, you can alter the environment to Devnet. Devnet is the test net that Solana developers can use to test their smart contract skills. You need to see for yourself how capable you are when it comes to building Solana smart contracts.\n\nAfter testing your skills, you need to produce a new key pair. It will basically enable the engagement of the account with the smart contracts and deployed applications in Solana Devnet. However, you need to bear in mind that this approach may not be entirely safe for crucial storage. Moreover, it is ideal only for the purpose of demonstration. Hence, for passing security, you will be elevated.\n\nOnce the creation of the account takes place, you can participate in airdrop and get your hands on the requisite SQL tokens. In addition, you will need certain imports to facilitate the implementation of the smart contract. To get the SQL tokens in the new account, you must use the suitable command. Now, you are ready to create the Hello World program with the help of the necessary command.\n\nAfter its creation, you need to deploy it on Devnet. With the outcome of the previous command, you acquire the command for launching the program. It brings the deploying process to an end. You need to allocate a programming ID to the application. You can authenticate the software on the Solana Devnet Explorer.\n\nStart learning Smart Contracts and its development tools with world’s first Smart Contracts Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nSolana is among the most popular names that one can come across in the blockchain realm.

    "content": "When it comes to Natural Language Processing, generative text is one of the most important use cases. Generative text involves making predictions of the words that will follow to form a sentence. In layman’s language generative text helps in predicting which word will be written after another word in a sentence. In the technology-driven era, you come across generative text almost everywhere, such as chatbots and word or sentence auto-corrections. Moreover, you may also come across them while performing grammar checks. Undoubtedly, today, generative text has become part and parcel of one’s daily life. Read on to find the answer to – What Is Syntactic Analysis NLP?\n\nSyntactic analysis basically refers to the process of examining natural language by applying the rules of formal grammar. By using grammatical rules for categories and groups of words, it is possible to allocate semantic structure to texts. However, you must bear in mind that grammar rules are not applicable to single words. In generative text, syntactic analysis helps in analyzing words to check for grammar and show the association. If you want to master Natural Language Processing, you must learn Syntactic Analysis NLP.\n\nUnlock your potential in Artificial Intelligence with the Certified AI Professional (CAIP)™ Certification. Elevate your career with expert-led training and gain the skills needed to thrive in today’s AI-driven world.\n\nWhen it comes to Natural Language Processing, syntax plays a cardinal role. This is because it serves as a roadmap for computer systems to comprehend as well as generate human language. Syntactic Analysis in NLP encompasses fragmenting sentences into their grammatical elements.\n\nFor example, sentences may be broken down into their grammar components, such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Thus, it enables machines to understand the structure as well as the meaning of the texts. You can familiarize yourself with the basics of the concept with the help of the Syntactic Analysis NLP guide.\n\nThe syntactic analysis, which is also known as parsing, is responsible for assigning a semantic structure to a given text. The assigning of a logical structure is possible by applying the rules of formal grammar in the context of natural language.\n\nYou can refer to Syntactic Analysis NLP examples to improve your clarity on the subject. Here is a simple example for your understanding! The sentence ‘Class go to a girl’ fails to make any sense. It does not have any logical meaning. Moreover, the grammatical structure of the sentence is also not accurate. In this scenario, syntactic analysis will tell us that the particular sentence has no rational or logical meaning. Similarly, it can also tell whether the grammatical structure of a sentence is right or wrong.\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nThe fundamental purpose of syntactic analysis is to derive meaning from a text. In the analysis, checks are in place so that texts which are not meaningful or which do not make sense can be rejected. By analyzing a string of symbols by using formal grammar as the guide, Syntactic Analysis In NLP carries out its function.\n\nSyntactic analysis aids in understanding the structure relating to the input text. The analysis is done at an in-depth level starting from the basic symbols to all the way to an entire sentence. This technique enables it to determine whether a text has any logical meaning or not. The concept is of critical importance since it enables machines to understand human language. It plays an instrumental role in bridging the gap between humans and systems.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nBefore diving further into the realm of Syntactic Analysis In NLP, you must understand different types of syntactic structures. Syntactic structures consist of a number of elements, such as phrases, clauses, constituency relations, and dependency relations.\n\nPhrases refer to a group of words that operate together as a single component within a sentence. Common terms encompass verb phrases as well as noun phrases.\n\nClauses consist of a subject along with a predicate. Hence, clauses are larger or wider units that are used in language. Clauses may be independent, also known as main clauses, or dependent clauses, also known as subordinate clauses.\n\nConstituency grammar is responsible for breaking sentences into constituents like verb and noun phrases. The purpose of the breakdown is to capture the constituents that shed light on the syntax structure of sentences.\n\nIn the case of dependency grammar, there exists a link between the words of sentences. The link is the dependency relation, which reveals how words in sentences depend on one another. The role of dependency relations is of high relevance in syntactic analysis. This is because they help in capturing the syntactic associations between words.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in the Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nThe Syntactic Analysis In NLP makes use of diverse approaches for performing the dissection of grammar structure in language. You need to familiarize yourself with these approaches to strengthen your grip on syntactic analysis. The syntactic analysis approaches present a foundation for the comprehension of how words and phrases in sentences are linked with one another. Some of the chief syntactic analysis approaches include:\n\nUnder this approach, context-free grammar is a conventional method. It acts as a useful method in the syntactic analysis domain. It involves a series of rules that capture how the combination of varying components of a sentence takes place. The context-free grammar rule assists in generating parse trees representing a sentence’s syntactic structure.\n\nDependency grammar is another approach that focuses on the associations that exist between the words of sentences. A unique feature is that instead of creating hierarchical structures, it uses direct links. These links between words showcase which words rely on or depend on others in a sentence. This approach is useful in the case of languages that have a relatively free word order.\n\nUnder the statistical approaches, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) is a common method. PCFG basically uses context-free grammar. This is done by assigning probabilities to every production rule. The probabilities are responsible for reflecting the likelihood for a specific rule to be applicable in specific scenarios. This method is common when it comes to statistical parsing. It helps in finding a sentence’s syntax structure, which has the highest likelihood.\n\nTransition-based parsing is another method under the statistical approaches category. It involves the deployment of machine learning techniques for incrementally creating a parse tree. This is done by making decisions at each and every step. In this approach, the use of a series of activities is essential for constructing the ultimate parse tree. Transition-based parsing is highly effective and valuable when it comes to real-time applications.\n\nThe common neural network-based approaches in syntactic analysis involve recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models. Each of these methods has different attributes that you must familiarize yourself with before knowing their application. The recurrent neural networks process sequences or series of words.\n\nMoreover, they maintain a hidden state which is responsible for capturing contextual information. A specific syntactic analysis task where RNN has high relevance is part-of-speech tagging. However, a key limitation of RNN is the sequential processing attribute, which limits its capabilities. Moreover, recurrent neural networks struggle when it comes to long-range dependencies.\n\nConvolutional neural networks are able to capture local patterns that may exist in the input. Due to this characteristic, CNN is suitable for the purpose of extracting syntactic associations between closely placed words. For performing dependency parching, the CNN method is applicable.\n\nThe common transformer models that have been revolutionizing Natural Language Processing are GPT and BERT. You must already be familiar with these elements and how they are transforming the role of NLP for one and all. These models are capable of capturing local as well as global syntactic information. Due to their robust capabilities, they are seen as state-of-the-art tools of the current era. Some of the syntactic analysis tasks for which these models are ideal include dependency parsing and constituency parsing.\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of key syntactic analysis approaches, you know their relevance. However, you must keep in mind that each approach has its unique strengths as well as limitations. So, you need to make the choice of the approach wisely by taking into consideration the task and the capabilities of the approaches.\n\nWant to learn about ChatGPT and other AI use cases? Enroll now in the ChatGPT Fundamentals Course\n\nIn syntactic analysis, the term parsing refers to the fundamental process of breaking down a sentence. By breaking the sentence into smaller fragments, it is possible to view their grammar components. Furthermore, it is possible to represent them in the form of a parse tree or a dependency graph. Over the years, a diverse range of parsing algorithms have come into existence for performing the specific task. In syntactic analysis, some of the common parsing algorithms are top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing, chart parsing, and shift-reduce parsing.\n\nTop-down parsing is also known as recursive descent parsing. It begins with the highest-level syntactic structure. Then, the structure is broken down into tinier constituents in a recursive manner. This parsing method initiates from the top-level grammar rule, and as it moves further, the lower-level rules are applicable. In case a rule is not applicable, then the parser retracts and considers different possibilities. The backtracking or retracting feature is the main limitation of top-down parsing.\n\nJust as the name suggests, bottom-up parsing is the opposite of the top-down parsing method. In bottom-up parsing, the parsing begins with single or individual words. The construction of the parse tree is possible through the bottom-up approach. In other words, the tress formation takes place by combining words in a successive manner to form more significant elements. A common example of the bottom-up parsing mechanism is shift-reducing parsing. In this method, progress is made by shifting words to a stack from the input. When the rule has been satisfied, they are reduced.\n\nChart parsing is a dynamic method that is suitable for ambiguous or unclear grammar. It is capable of creating a chart data structure for storing and combining partial parse trees in an effective manner. In chart parsing, the application of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) or Earley parser algorithm is common for context-free grammars.\n\nOne of the main highlights of chart phasing is that they are capable of handling ambiguity. Importantly, they are able to give a diverse range of parses for a single sentence. As a result, chart parsing is of immense value when it comes to natural languages which have complex syntax structures.\n\nThe application of shift-reduce parsing is common in the case of dependency parsing with the objective of forming a dependency tree. A unique feature of shift-reduce parsing is that the parser maintains a series of actions along with a stack of words. The grammar rule serves as the ultimate guide on the basis of which the shifting of words takes place. It is a highly efficient method that is capable of handling non-projective syntax structures. Although other parsing may struggle to deal with them, the shift-reduce parsing algorithm may be able to effortlessly work with non-projective syntax structures.\n\nIn the context of syntactic analysis, the relevance of parsing algorithms is high. These algorithms basically enable NLP to make sense of the structure of different sentences. Additionally, they also aid in extracting grammar information and recognizing relationships between words.\n\nDevelop expert-level skills in prompt engineering with the Prompt Engineer Career Path\n\nIn NLP, the role of syntactic analysis is indispensable. It acts as the ultimate medium that helps to understand the logical meaning of sentences or certain parts of sentences. Without performing syntactic analysis, machines might fail to understand human language.

    "content": "Smart contracts are an essential component for ensuring decentralized and automatic execution of transactions on blockchain networks. It primarily deals with transactions involving financial assets. On the other hand, it is important to know that common smart contract vulnerabilities could lead to big losses. As a matter of fact, smart contract vulnerabilities have been responsible for financial losses measuring over $12.3 billion. For example, the DODO DEX lost almost $3.8 million in March 2022 to a smart contract vulnerability. In April 2023, one of the popular DeFi platforms, Yearn Finance, lost $10 million due to smart contract flaws.\n\nSmart contracts are responsible for transactions involving massive volumes of important data and assets, such as money transfers, service delivery, and access to protected content. As a result, they can be easy targets for hackers and other malicious actors. On the other hand, awareness of smart contract vulnerabilities could offer the opportunity to prepare for smart contract attacks. Let us learn more about some of the most common vulnerabilities of smart contracts and how you can resolve them.\n\nExcited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nSecurity is one of the foremost priorities in the process of designing and developing smart contracts. The different types of smart contract attacks in recent times and their magnitude imply that smart contract security is a mandatory requirement for new blockchain and web3 solutions. On top of that, you could not make any changes in the smart contracts once they have been deployed to blockchain networks with different vulnerabilities.\n\nMost important of all, the vulnerabilities of smart contracts are visible to everyone after they have been deployed on blockchain networks. Therefore, development teams and smart contract engineers must pay attention to the most important attack vectors for smart contracts. Here is an outline of the most common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the strategies for mitigating them.\n\nOne of the prominent entries among vulnerabilities for smart contracts is Oracle manipulation. Smart contracts rely on oracles for accessing external data from sources outside the blockchain network. However, oracles can be responsible for smart contract security issues as malicious actors could manipulate oracles to achieve personal interests.\n\nOracles help smart contracts interact with off-chain systems. On the other hand, manipulated or inaccurate Oracle data could enable automatic execution of smart contracts. Such types of issues are classified as Oracle issues for smart contracts. The Oracle issue has been responsible for exploitation of different DeFi applications.\n\nThe most common example of such problems with smart contracts is visible in the flash loan attacks. Flash loans allow users to borrow any amount of cryptocurrency without any limit as long as they repay the loan in the same transaction. Attackers can use such loans to distort asset prices and generate profits without compromising the principles of blockchain technology.\n\nYou can find solutions to the Oracle issue for smart contracts with decentralized oracles, such as Tellor or Chainlink. Another recommended mitigation strategy for such risks points to the use of multiple oracles. Decentralized oracles or multiple oracles for one smart contract ensure accuracy of input data for the oracle. Such types of oracles increase the difficulty and cost of manipulating oracle data.\n\n\n\nThe most noticeable example of web2 attacks that have transitioned into the domain of web3 is denial of service. Smart contracts are also vulnerable to denial of service attacks. It is one of the common entries in a smart contract vulnerabilities list, which can create setbacks for users and reputation of web3 projects. The attack involves overloading a smart contract with services, such as authentication tasks.\n\nAs a result, the attacker could prevent other contracts from execution and lead to unexpected reverts. For example, denial of service attacks can return unused gas and revert the state of the smart contract to the state prior to execution of the transaction. Subsequently, the attacker could find that the results of an auction or values in financial transactions can be manipulated easily.\n\nThe promising approach to solving such types of smart contract attacks focuses on making the attacks costly. What are the proven ways to improve the cost of denial of service attacks for hackers? Higher gas fees and time-lock puzzles are some of the effective measures for increasing the costs of attackers. In addition, mitigation strategies for denial of service attacks also focus on making calls only to trusted contracts.\n\nThe collection of different types of vulnerabilities for smart contracts also includes timestamp dependence. It is important to note that the node executing the smart contract generates timestamp values. How does the timestamp lead to smart contract vulnerabilities, and what is their impact? The distributed nature of Ethereum creates difficulties in synchronization of time on every node. Since Ethereum is the preferred platform for developing and deploying smart contracts, it exacerbates the timestamp dependence issue.\n\nMalicious nodes could manipulate the timestamp value for designing a logic attack. The logic attack would target contracts that utilize the block timestamp variable for execution of time-critical operations. You can resolve such vulnerabilities by avoiding the use of block timestamp function for control or logic checks. It is also important to refrain from using block timestamp function as a source of randomness.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n\nAnother common vulnerability in smart contracts is a reentrancy attack. The attack vector emerges from the imperative execution of Solidity smart contracts. Imperative execution implies that smart contracts must execute each line of code before the next line. It implies that the execution of the calling contract can be put on hold till the return of the call when the contract makes external calls to a different contract. Reentrancy attacks are one of the common additions to a smart contract vulnerabilities list, as the external contract could gain temporary control over the next sequence of events. As a result, reentrancy attacks lead to the creation of an infinite loop.\n\nAssume that a malicious contract attempts a recursive call to the original contract to withdraw resources without completion of the first call. As a result, the original contract would never have the opportunity to update the balance before completing the function. The smart contract security issues with reentrancy could take the form of multiple types of attacks. Some of the common types of reentrancy attacks include single-function, read-only, cross-function, and cross-contract reentrancy attacks.\n\nYou can resolve problems with reentrancy attacks through careful design of external calls. It is important to note that such vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the code logic of smart contracts. Therefore, it is important to check and ensure updates on the state of the contract.\n\nIn addition, you can also find another proven safeguard against reentrancy attacks with a reentrancy guard. Reentrancy guards could prevent the execution of multiple functions at one instance by locking the contract. You can rely on smart contract audit tools such as Mythril and Slither for checking the presence of different variants of reentrancy attacks.\n\nWant to know about the possible use cases of smart contract audits? Check out Smart Contract Audit Presentation now!\n\nSmart contracts are transparent, which implies that they are publicly visible on the blockchain network. Miners of a block could choose transactions with the highest gas fees. The priority fee is an effective tool for ensuring that you can have your transaction approved before other transactions.\n\nHowever, it also leads to problems with smart contracts as attackers could front-run the profitable contracts through submission of an identical contract, albeit with a higher gas fee. Generally, attackers implement frontrunning attacks through bots or even miners.\n\nYou have to look for effective solutions to mitigate the risks of frontrunning attacks. One of the proven solutions for mitigating the risks of frontrunning involves accepting transactions that have the gas price below a specific threshold. You can also find a solution with a commit-and-reveal scheme in which users submit a solution hash first rather than a clear text solution. Malicious actors cannot view the solution before it is too late. At the same time, smart contract auditing tools can help in detecting frontrunning vulnerabilities.\n\nArithmetic operations also play a role in creating vulnerabilities for smart contracts. Integer overflows and underflows are the most common smart contract vulnerabilities resulting from arithmetic operations surpassing the fixed range for the values. For the integer type uint8, the range of values spans from 0 to 255.\n\nIf the values are higher than 255, then they would overflow, and the value would be reset to 0. On the other hand, values that are lower than 0 would be reset to 255. As a result, the state variables of the contract and the logic could go through unexpected modifications and could trigger invalid operations.\n\nThe Solidity compiler, starting from version 0.8.0, would not allow code that could lead to integer overflows and underflows. It is also important to check the contracts that could be compiled with the earlier versions to support functions that involve a library or use arithmetic operations.\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology enables better accessibility for every individual. Sensitive and confidential information must be encrypted before they are saved to a blockchain network. However, transparency leads to different types of smart contract attacks due to visibility of functions and variables in smart contracts. As a result, the functions and variables would be open to abuse and misuse. You can find a solution to such issues with improvements in development workflow.\n\nDevelopers must ensure the implementation of proper access controls. In addition, developers must also implement the principle of least privilege with the help of variable and function visibility modifiers in Solidity. The modifiers help in assigning minimum visibility levels according to the desired requirements.\n\nThe next prominent cause for smart contract security issues points to the problems with force-feeding attacks. Developers could not prevent smart contracts from receiving the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, Ether. Malicious actors could utilize this vulnerability for force-feeding smart contracts with Ether.\n\nThe attack revolves around the premise of manipulating the balance of Ether in the smart contract. The change in balance of Ether could lead to manipulation of function logic that depends only on desired balance for internal accounting. Some of the internal accounting processes include paying out rewards when the balance exceeds a specific level.\n\nThe problem with such smart contract vulnerabilities is that it is difficult to stop the manipulation of smart contract balance. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the balance of the contract does not serve as a guard or check within a function. The actual balance of the Ether could be higher than the balance expected by the internal code of the contract.\n\nAnother prominent addition to the smart contract vulnerabilities list is gas griefing. Users should pay a gas fee for performing a transaction or executing smart contract on Ethereum blockchain. It serves as an incentive for the validators or miners to verify transactions. On the other hand, the price of gas depends on network capacity, supply, and demand at the time of transaction.\n\nGas griefing happens when users send the gas fees required for executing the desired smart contract. However, they don’t send the fees required for executing subcalls or the calls made by the contract to other contracts. It would lead to a significant influence on the logic of the smart contract.\n\nThe problem is that there is no proven technique for preventing gas griefing. Developers could find a solution by coding a contract for defining the amount of gas rather than the user. Such types of solutions are more likely to increase the chances of transaction failure.\n\nStart learning Smart Contracts and its development tools with world’s first Smart Contracts Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nThe review of the different smart contract vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies shows that awareness could solve a lot of problems. You should understand the importance of smart contracts in managing valuable data and resources. Flaws in smart contracts could lead to security issues that impose the burden of financial losses.\n\nTherefore, smart contract developers must prepare an effective risk management strategy and smart contract audit plan for identifying vulnerabilities. Learn more about smart contract fundamentals to obtain a first-hand impression of the potential sources of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Artificial intelligence has reached a position that would be impossible to imagine a few years back. Machine learning models are capable of producing output that would have required months of work from expert data scientists. Artificial intelligence technology has helped in achieving significant wonders that would be impossible for human beings. You might wonder why you should focus on questions like “What is convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?” in discussions about artificial intelligence and ML.\n\nThe most important reason to focus on convolutional neural networks in AI is the limitations of AI in image processing. AI models have not proved as effective as the human brain in recognizing and processing images. The human brain works in mysterious and complex ways. You could not find a definitive way to understand the cognition and rendering mechanisms of the brain. You can find different layers of interconnected neurons in the human brain. Interestingly, AI can replicate the structure of your brain with the help of artificial neurons.\n\nIn the mid-20s, artificial neural networks gained momentum as they offered capabilities for learning from data in a theoretical manner. However, artificial neural networks had to evolve into convolutional neural networks. It was a vital necessity to adapt to the use cases of image recognition and processing. Let us learn more about convolutional neural networks and how they work.\n\n\n\nNeural networks are an important subset in the domain of machine learning. You can understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an important component in the world of deep learning algorithms. Neural networks include node layers featuring an input layer alongside one or multiple hidden layers and an output layer. When the output of individual nodes exceeds a specific threshold value, the node starts working and sends data to the next layer in the network. Without such procedures, it is impossible to pass data along to the next layer in the network.\n\nYou can come across different types of neural networks that are suitable for different data types and use cases. For example, recurrent neural networks are generally used in speech recognition and natural language processing tasks. On the other hand, a convolutional neural network example would show that CNNs are generally used for computer vision tasks. CNNs can also support image classification tasks. Before the arrival of convolutional neural networks, the identification of objects in images involved time-intensive methods for feature extraction.\n\nConvolutional neural networks offer a scalable approach for object recognition and image classification tasks. CNNs utilize linear algebra principles, such as matrix multiplication, for effective identification of patterns in an image. However, the working of CNNs may demand excessive use of computational resources, such as graphical processing units or GPUs.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in the Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nAnother important highlight in a guide to learn convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the working mechanism of CNNs. You can learn more about the workings of CNNs by uncovering information about their architecture. Convolutional neural networks are different from other neural networks in that they have superior performance for image, audio, and speech signal inputs. The architecture of convolutional neural networks includes three layers: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully-connected layer.\n\nIt is important to note that the CNN becomes more complex with every layer and identifies larger portions in the image. The initial layers emphasize simple features, such as edges and colors. When the image data moves through different layers of the CNN, it recognizes the larger elements or shapes of objects until it identifies the desired object. Here is an outline of the different ways in which the different layers in CNNs work.\n\nThe most integral component of a convolutional neural network is the convolutional network. The working mechanism of convolutional neural networks explained to beginners, revolves around the convolutional layer, which is the core building block of CNNs. It is the site where most of the computation works in a convolutional neural network.\n\nSome of the notable components in the convolutional layer include input data, feature maps, and filters. For example, the input for the convolutional layer can be a color image that includes a matrix of 3D pixels. Therefore, the input would have three different dimensions, height, depth, and width, which correlate with the RGB in the image.\n\nConvolutional layer also includes a feature detector or a filter. Also known as kernel, the feature detector would traverse through receptive areas of the image to check for a feature. The process that helps in recognition of objects in images is convolution.\n\nThe feature detector in the convolutional layer of CNNs is a two-dimensional array of weights that represents different parts of the image. Although the array can vary in size, the filter size is generally a 3×3 matrix, which also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is implemented on an area of the image, followed by calculation of a dot product between the filter and the input pixels.\n\nYou can then feed the dot product into an output array. Subsequently, the filter would shift by a huge margin and repeat the process until the kernel covers the complete image. The final output obtained from the sequence of dot products from the input and filter serves as the feature map or activation map.\n\nThe description of convolutional neural network introduction also emphasizes the fact that weights in the feature detector are fixed during movement through the image. Parameter sharing enables consistency in the weights of feature detector. However, some of the parameters, such as weight values, can vary during the course of training through gradient descent and backpropagation.\n\nOn the other hand, you can find three hyper-parameters that influence the volume size of the output that you must set prior to the training of neural networks. The three hyper-parameters include a number of filters, stride, and zero-padding.\n\nThe architecture of convolutional neural network also includes an additional convolutional layer other than initial convolution layer. It is an important tool in convolutional neural network applications as the additional convolutional layer follows the first convolutional layer.\n\nThe structure of the convolutional neural network becomes hierarchical, and later layers can witness the pixels in receptive fields of previous layers. Finally, the convolutional layer transforms the image to numerical values, thereby helping the neural network in interpretation and extraction of relevant patterns.\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nThe next important layer in the architecture of CNNs refers to pooling layers or downsampling. It helps in conducting dimensionality reduction alongside reducing the number of parameters in the input. Just like the convolutional layer, the pooling layer would pass a filter throughout the complete input. However, the filter in the pooling layer does not rely on weights. On the contrary, the kernel utilizes an aggregation function to the values in the receptive field, thereby filling the output array.\n\nThe review of pooling layer in the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) shows that you can utilize two variants of pooling. You can find two types of pooling when working with convolutional neural networks: average pooling and max pooling. When the filter moves through the input, it can choose the pixel with the maximum value for transferring to the output array in max pooling.\n\nInterestingly, max pooling is a commonly used approach in the pooling layer. You can understand the mechanisms of average pooling when the filter moves through the input and determines the average value in the receptive field that it should send to the output array. The pooling layer is the site in a CNN where it loses a lot of information. However, it presents multiple advantages, including reduction of complexity, reduced risks of overfitting, and improved efficiency.\n\nThe final addition among the components in the architecture of convolutional layer networks is the fully-connected layer. As the name implies, it serves as a comprehensively connected layer in the CNNs. One of the important aspects of a convolutional neural network introduction points to how the pixel values of the input images do not have a direct connection to output layer in the partially connected layers. On the other hand, a fully connected layer has every node in the output layer connecting directly to another node in a previous layer.\n\nThe fully connected layer addresses the requirements of tasks, such as classification according to features identified through previous layers and different filters. Convolutional and pooling layers generally use ReLu functions, and fully connected layers rely on a softmax activation function for appropriate classification of inputs.\n\n\n\nThe rise of convolutional neural networks has become a formidable highlight in the domain of AI. However, it is important to review every convolutional neural network example from the perspective of previous traditional neural networks. Traditional neural networks, such as multilayer perceptrons, include different types of fully connected layers. The neural networks can be versatile, albeit without optimization for spatial data such as images. It can create different types of problems when used to manage larger and more complex input data.\n\nIn the case of smaller images with limited color channels, traditional neural networks can produce satisfactory results. However, the increasing image size and complexity can lead to the requirement of computational resources. In addition, traditional neural networks experience concerns of overfitting because fully connected architectures do not prioritize the relevant features automatically. Convolutional neural networks are different in many ways.\n\nFirst of all, the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks explained the ways in which every node is not connected to all nodes in the next layer. Convolutional layers have limited parameters as compared to fully connected layers in traditional neural networks. Therefore, CNNs can perform image processing tasks with better efficiency.\n\nConvolutional neural networks utilize the parameter-sharing technique for efficiency in management of image data. The convolutional layers work with the same filter for scanning the complete image, thereby reducing the number of parameters. Subsequently, the pooling layers also present promising advantages by reducing dimensionality of the data to improve overall generalization and efficiency of a convolutional neural network.\n\nIdentify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path\n\nDeep learning is a prominent subdomain of machine learning and utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to achieve benefits that are impossible to achieve with single-layer networks. Convolutional neural networks are a prominent variant of deep learning algorithms. More people want to learn convolutional neural networks (CNNs) because they are the best tools for computer vision tasks, including image classification and object recognition. CNNs are designed to learn the spatial hierarchies of features in an image by capturing the essential features in early layers alongside complex patterns in the deeper layers.\n\nThe most significant benefit of CNN for deep learning is the ability to perform feature learning and automatic feature extraction. It eliminates the necessity of extracting features through manual measures that involve intensive use of labor and complex processes. The review of convolutional neural network applications also shows that they are useful for transfer learning. In this approach, you can fine-tune a pre-trained model for new tasks.\n\nThe reusability ensures that CNNs are efficient in dealing with a versatile range of tasks with limitations on training data. ML developers can use CNNs in different real-world scenarios without building up computational costs. Therefore, convolutional neural networks can serve as a valuable resource in different sectors such as retail, healthcare, social media, and automotive industry.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards\n\nThe applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) spelled new benchmarks for transformation of conventional perspectives regarding usability of AI models. You can notice how the structure of CNNs helps them address the tasks of image classification and object detection.

However, the growing popularity of blockchain has also invited attention to security issues. The burden of financial losses due to blockchain security incidents in 2022 amounted to more than $4 billion. Therefore, it is important to learn blockchain security top practices for ensuring effective safeguards against existing and emerging threats to blockchain security. Let us learn more about the best practices for ensuring blockchain security.\n\n\n\nYou can find effective ways to ensure blockchain security by learning about the security principles of blockchain. The best way to find answers to “What are the security principles of blockchain?” involves learning about blockchain technology. You can come across multiple guides on the internet that explain the fundamentals of blockchain technology.\n\nIn simple words, blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that helps users and organizations store and process data in a completely decentralized manner. The blocks of transactions in the decentralized network are connected to the previous blocks with a cryptographic function. Therefore, it is practically impossible to modify transactions once they are registered on the blockchain network.\n\nThe important concepts for privacy and security in blockchain draw attention towards immutability, transparency of transactions, decentralized access, and cryptographic security. These traits are the essential principles of blockchain security. For example, immutability and cryptographic security ensure that it is impossible to make unauthorized modifications in transactions on blockchain networks.\n\nOn top of it, the transparency of transactions also helps in monitoring everything that happens in a blockchain network through detailed audit trails. With all these traits, it is reasonable to expect that blockchain would be inherently secure. However, blockchain is also vulnerable to security concerns due to different factors.\n\nIt is important to note that blockchain leverages decentralization for entrusting power in the hands of users. At the same time, it also puts the responsibility of blockchain security in the control of users. Therefore, blockchain security vulnerabilities can emerge due to the lapses on behalf of users.\n\nFor example, users may give away their private keys in phishing attacks or lose their hardware wallets. On top of it, smart contracts are also a major component in blockchain applications and a prominent target for security vulnerabilities. For instance, hackers can exploit errors in the smart contract code to implement denial of service attacks or reentrancy attacks.\n\nExcited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nBlockchain security serves as a comprehensive risk management procedure that involves the use of cybersecurity frameworks, secure coding practices, and security testing methodologies. The primary objective of blockchain security revolves around ensuring safeguards against online fraud, security breaches, and different types of attacks.\n\nThe responses to “What are the security principles of blockchain?” draw the limelight on cryptography, consensus, and decentralization. However, blockchain solutions are vulnerable to different risks, with continuously increasing burden of the financial impact of blockchain security breaches. The global blockchain market could achieve a capitalization of almost $20 billion in 2024, thereby attracting more attackers.\n\nThe review of prominent security breaches in the domain of blockchain in recent times can help in understanding the necessity of blockchain security. For example, the DAO hack led to loss of more than $60 million worth of Ether. In addition, blockchain bridges have also become susceptible to hacks, leading to another formidable security concern. As the number of organizations investing in blockchain solutions continues growing, it is important to understand the significance of blockchain security.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe adoption of blockchain by different businesses presents a favorable trend for blockchain technology. However, security concerns affect the blockchain-based systems for business applications. The risks to blockchain security in business would create difficulties in establishing trust. Here are some of the most prominent best practices that businesses should follow to ensure security of blockchain solutions.\n\nThe first thing businesses know about blockchain is the assurance of cryptographic security. Therefore, they are likely to assume that it is possible to use blockchain with personally identifiable information or PII. The problem in this case is that hackers could find different ways to break into the cryptographic algorithms safeguarding blockchains. Technological advancements such as quantum computing could create opportunities for hackers to compromise cryptographic keys. Businesses should follow the best practice of avoiding the use of personally identifiable information on blockchain networks.\n\nAnother important addition among blockchain security best practices for businesses draws attention toward avoiding large files. Data on blockchain is replicated across different nodes or systems in the network. When data is stored on blockchain, it can increase the storage and compute costs.\n\nOn top of it, large files are not secure on blockchain networks. Users can opt for pointers or links to large files that are stored on Google Cloud Platform or AWS Cloud. In addition, businesses can also include a hash, which can help verify whether the content of a file has been changed by comparing it with the same hashing algorithm.\n\nPublic blockchains allow anyone to access information, add transactions, and read data on the blockchain. However, businesses need privacy and security in blockchain solutions as they cannot expose some of their data in public. In such cases, permissioned blockchain networks come into play and allow the storage and access of data within certain boundaries. Permissioned blockchains can enable storage, access, and use of data with the help of permissions or passwords.\n\nFor example, Ethereum and Bitcoin are public blockchains. On the other hand, Hyperledger blockchain enables the creation of permissioned solutions for businesses. If you want to maintain privacy of your data, you should utilize a permissioned blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are also known as consortium blockchains and private blockchains.\n\nBusinesses can choose blockchain networks depending on their requirements and specific use cases. Blockchain developers and architects must look for tradeoffs and advantages of a network. Do you have to compromise with scalability to improve performance, or is it the other way around?\n\nOne of the notable mentions among blockchain security top practices draws attention toward the blockchain trilemma. Apart from scalability and performance, you have to focus on security. Therefore, it is important to choose blockchain networks that offer exclusive value advantages of security.\n\nThe challenges with governance model of a blockchain can also create problems for businesses. Businesses can avoid security issues by defining the governance structure before they leverage a blockchain platform. You can safeguard a blockchain by choosing the right governance mechanism that helps in deciding how to add or remove users in an organization. The governance structure could also address the procedures for different possible situations and methods for coping with user interactions.\n\nWant to explore an in-depth understanding of security threats in DeFi projects? Enroll now in DeFi Security Fundamentals Course\n\nThe best practices for blockchain security draw references towards secure development of blockchain solutions. You can address blockchain security vulnerabilities by following the best practices to create blockchain solutions. The foremost recommendation for businesses to create blockchain solutions is the use of a ‘security-by-design’ approach.\n\nDevelopers should ensure precise definitions and enforcement of endorsement agreements on the basis of business contracts. It is also important to pay attention to identity and access management controls for managing data access in blockchain networks. In addition, businesses must also rely on the following best practices for safeguarding blockchain security.\n\n\n\nThe important additions to blockchain security best practices also point to blockchain penetration testing. It is a security assessment process that helps in testing the resilience of a blockchain solution against security threats. The primary goal of blockchain penetration testing revolves around uncovering security loopholes and vulnerabilities alongside identifying misconfiguration errors.\n\nBusinesses can use blockchain penetration testing to obtain insights into the overall security status of a blockchain network or app. It helps in proactive mitigation of security risks in blockchain solutions.

The zero-shot learning capabilities of the large language model help it in understanding the task and generating the relevant output in both examples. On the other hand, it is important to note that zero-shot prompting does not deliver accurate results in all cases. However, a few-shot approach for prompting the language model could overcome the limitation by providing examples or demonstrations to LLMs.\n\nEnroll now in the ChatGPT Fundamentals Course and dive into the world of prompt engineering with practical demonstrations.\n\nThe next important technique among zero-shot and few-shot prompting serves as an effective answer for overcoming the limitations of zero-shot prompting. It helps large language models in ensuring better performance for complex tasks by offering demonstrations. On the other hand, it has problems in addressing tasks that require reasoning. In such cases, prompt engineers would have to turn towards advanced prompt engineering techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nAt the same time, zero-shot and few-shot prompting examples show that few-shot learning can offer a more effective alternative to zero-shot training. It can utilize different numbers of examples, such as one-shot, three-shot, or five-shot learning. The examples for few-shot learning include input-output pairs that guide the LLM in generating desired responses. However, few-shot learning also has certain limitations.\n\nThe review of few-shot prompting examples would help in understanding the working mechanisms of few-shot learning. Few-shot learning involves in-context learning through the use of examples that help in conditioning the behavior of the LLM. Here are some of the notable examples of few-shot learning.\n\nPrompt 1: Whatpus are small, furry animals found in Tanzania.\n\nOutput: We saw whatpus during our vacation in Africa.\n\nPrompt 2: Farduddle means jumping up and down vigorously.\n\nOutput: We could not help but farduddle upon hearing the news of victory.\n\nIn both examples, the LLM could learn the ideal approach for performing the desired task with the help of one example. Therefore, the prompting approach in this case would be one-shot learning.\n\nIdentify the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with the Generative AI Skill Path.\n\nThe following example could help you understand how zero-shot and few-shot prompting are different from each other. The example revolves around the use of random labels for sentiment analysis tasks. Here is an example of the prompt.\n\nThis is great! // Negative This is sad! // Positive Wow, that movie was amazing! // Positive What a big letdown! //\n\nThe output for the sentiment analysis task prompt would be negative. You can notice that the randomization of labels does not generate the correct answer for the model. At the same time, you could also notice the significance of format in few-shot learning examples.\n\nThe answers to “What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompts?” point to the fact that few-shot learning could address complex tasks. On the other hand, few-shot learning also struggles to complete tasks that need complex reasoning. Let us assume that you use the following prompt.\n\nThe odd numbers in this collection add up to create an even number: 32, 13, 15, 82, 7, 5, and 1.\n\nThe response of the LLM for this prompt might be,\n\nYes, the odd numbers in the collection add up to 110, which is an even number.\n\nAs you can notice, the response of the LLM is completely inaccurate, thereby suggesting that few-shot prompting could not deal with such problems. You can also try adding more examples to guide the behavior of the LLM. However, it might not stand up to the challenge of generating relevant responses in complex reasoning tasks. At the same time, the examples show that few-shot learning could help in improving the performance of LLMs for different tasks.

    "content": "Regulators in the domain of finance are still confused about what to do with cryptocurrencies. The asset class does not fit within the existing categories of financial assets. However, the collapse of crypto giants such as FTX in 2022 created the need for better regulations. Therefore, it is important to learn more about cryptocurrency regulations around the world and their implications. You must learn how governments attempt to revolutionize regulatory oversight in cryptocurrencies. The problem with cryptocurrency regulations is the primary value proposition of cryptocurrencies that enables their operations beyond government control. Regulators all over the world, from Asia to Europe, have pushed harder for crypto regulations in 2023. However, the US has been one of the most active proponents of strict legal actions against top players. For example, Binance had to pay a fine of more than $4 billion to US authorities.\n\nThe consistently increasing push towards cryptocurrency regulations by country has emerged as a prominent highlight in the crypto landscape. The predictions about cryptocurrencies suggest that the market could be worth $5 billion by 2030. Therefore, it is important to think of regulations for such a massive sector. Let us find out how cryptocurrency regulations vary across different countries in the following post.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe regulatory landscape in the domain of cryptocurrencies has become a crucial and complex highlight. Everyone in the crypto landscape, including crypto developers, investors, policymakers, and enthusiasts, must focus on regulations. The search for answers to questions like “Which countries have regulated cryptocurrency?” would lead you to multiple alternatives. It is important to note that different countries follow unique approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. The diverse regulations in the domain of cryptocurrency showcase the range of issues and opinions regarding the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some countries have actively embraced blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, thereby encouraging investment and innovative advancements.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of cryptocurrency regulations is that many nations have embraced cryptocurrencies. Countries such as Malta, El Salvador, Switzerland, and Estonia have emerged as major cryptocurrency hubs. They provide a supportive environment that would encourage the participation of businesses working with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, some countries have implemented a strict approach towards cryptocurrency regulations by banning crypto activities. For example, China, Algeria, and Bolivia have actively banned ICOs and trading by showcasing concerns regarding financial instability and speculations.\n\nLearn the fundamentals, working principle and the future prospects of cryptocurrencies from Cryptocurrency E-Book\n\nThe scope of cryptocurrency regulations in the world right now would emphasize multiple aspects regarding the utility of crypto regulations. A review of US cryptocurrency regulations should not focus only on managing the legal aspects of cryptocurrencies and their usage. It is also important to identify challenges that emerge in the process of navigating regulations for the global cryptocurrency landscape. Some of the most prominent challenges associated with cryptocurrency regulations include lack of clarity and the pace of technological advancements. In addition, blockchain and cryptocurrency are borderless technologies, and you can find diverse approaches to crypto regulation.\n\nThe first aspect you might come across in an overview of crypto regulations is the pace of technological advancements. Regulators experience difficulties in adapting to the rapid pace of the evolution of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. In addition, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency regulations in India would vary from those in the EU. Therefore, crypto regulations tend to be more inconsistent and create setbacks for innovation alongside creating difficulties for compliance.\n\nAnother prominent challenge with cryptocurrency regulations is the lack of clarity, as most of them are subject to interpretation. It leads to uncertainty for investors and businesses, alongside creating a lack of confidence. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have global jurisdiction, thereby creating difficulties in the international enforcement of regulations.\n\nExcited to know the use cases of crypto in NFTs, DeFi, and the metaverse, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe arrival of cryptocurrency regulations in the world is good news for businesses and governments worldwide. However, cryptocurrency regulations in the UK and the US are not the only points of attention in the crypto regulatory landscape. It is important to look at the regulations in other countries and the ways in which they serve unique implications. For example, some countries have introduced laws for the governance of cryptocurrency usage. On the other hand, others have included cryptocurrencies in existing AML regulations and taxation rules. On top of it, there are many countries working on modifications in the crypto regulatory frameworks. At the same time, they also experience struggles due to the intervention of multiple governments and financial regulatory authorities. Here is an overview of the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies across different jurisdictions.\n\nOne of the important highlights in the review of cryptocurrency regulations by country draws attention to the United States. The US was the first destination of a retail Bitcoin transaction. However, cryptocurrency regulations are implemented in different ways, and they don’t have the status of a legal tender. At the same time, several state governments and the IRS attach some value to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network attaches transmittable value to cryptocurrencies without considering them as legal tender. The IRS states that just like other income modes, Bitcoin is also subject to taxation. According to the taxation authority, cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that work as a medium of exchange, store of value, or unit of account. It works by issuing tax guidelines for cryptocurrencies, albeit without considering them to be legal tender.\n\nAnother important aspect of US cryptocurrency regulations draws attention to the legality of crypto exchanges. The good thing for cryptocurrencies is the legality of crypto exchanges across the United States. Crypto exchanges are subject to regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. In the case of cryptocurrency regulations, the SEC assumes that cryptocurrencies are securities. Therefore, it can apply the laws used for the governance of securities to crypto exchanges and digital wallets. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network suggests that all digital wallets and crypto exchanges must share information about the issuer and beneficiary of all crypto transactions.\n\nThe future of regulations in the US would revolve around combating cybercrime involving cryptocurrencies. It is important to note that the US has emerged as one of the most active enforcers of cryptocurrency regulations. As a matter of fact, the US is the only country that has actively implemented regulatory measures against big crypto companies.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n\nThe discussions about the answers to ‘which countries have regulated cryptocurrency’ also bring Europe to the limelight. It is important to note that the European Union is all set to implement the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation in 2024. The legislation aims to manage the complicated crypto industry. It was proposed in 2019 in response to the announcement of Diem, the crypto token of Meta. The legislation aimed to deal with money laundering, fraud, and concerns of illicit financing in the domain of cryptocurrencies. Another important aspect of the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation is its role in addressing perceived threats with stablecoins and CBDCs.\n\nWhy would stablecoins present a threat? Private stablecoins from large companies such as Mastercard, Meta, and Visa could pose bigger threats. They have the potential to undermine sovereign currencies. One part of the EU’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies focuses on addressing threats by ensuring that issuers cannot mint stablecoins backed by currencies other than the Euro. In addition, the EU also presents another perspective on cryptocurrency regulations around the world as it plans to introduce a unified regulatory framework. As a matter of fact, the three major political institutions in the EU have approved the Markets in Crypto Assets or MiCA regulation. Although it has been enforced since June 2023, it would become fully functional only by December 2024.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path.\n\nAnother important addition among the countries which are the largest markets for cryptocurrencies is India. The scope of cryptocurrency regulations in India revolves around uncertainty, as there is no clear definition of regulations for cryptocurrencies. As a matter of fact, India exercised a warning for investors and advised them to stay away from crypto trading in 2013. At the time of writing this post, cryptocurrency was still not legal tender in India. On top of that, cryptocurrencies are not classified as a security or commodity.\n\nIt is also important to note that India’s annual budget in 2022 imposed a tax of almost 30% on cryptocurrency transactions. The positive side of crypto regulations in India is that Bitcoin trading has gained legal status. On top of it, India also planned to introduce a digital currency that would offer a boost to the Indian economy. The digital currency based on blockchain can serve as an effective alternative to Bitcoin and could offer a more efficient and cheaper currency management system.\n\nThe discussions about cryptocurrency legislation in India also draw attention to crypto exchanges. As you study more about cryptocurrency regulations by country, you can find that India exercises a strong restraint against crypto exchanges now. The Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, sent a notice to all banks in India in 2018, advising them against transactions with crypto exchanges. However, the Supreme Court overruled this decision in March 2020. It did not have any impact on the interest of investors as they had developed fear, and many investors sold their crypto assets in large numbers in November 2021.\n\nAs the demand for crypto regulations gains momentum, the Indian government is actively making efforts to establish crypto regulations. The primary focus of the new guidelines revolves around the regulation of different crypto exchanges such as WazirX. With the new regulations, the Government of India aims to offer safer transactions to end users. In addition, the regulations also aim to address the concerns of illegal financing and money laundering with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies?

The review of cryptocurrency regulations in the UK has to show the world revolves primarily around ownership of cryptocurrencies and trading. While the Bank of England has declared that cryptocurrencies are not ‘real money,’ it has also stated that they don’t pose threats to the traditional banking ecosystem. On the other hand, the legal consequences and status of cryptocurrencies would change with time, according to their type, usage, and nature.\n\nThe Bank of England and the FCA or Financial Conduct Authority have declared warnings alongside guidance on the use of cryptocurrency in the UK. As a matter of fact, the authorities banned retail cryptocurrency derivatives in December 2020 on the grounds of volatility risks. The UK is also a top addition among responses to ‘which countries have regulated cryptocurrency’ with a specific emphasis on taxation. The HM Revenue and Customs, or HMRC, has declared that the taxation of cryptocurrencies would be different as they could not be classified as traditional investments or financial assets. According to HMRC, the tax on cryptocurrencies would depend on parties involved in crypto transactions and their activities.\n\nThe good news for crypto regulations in the UK is the legal validity of cryptocurrency exchanges. However, crypto exchanges must be registered with the FCA. All the crypto firms in the UK that operate in the UK and serve UK resident clients must have FCA registration. Any registered crypto service provider in the UK must abide by the rules for AML/CFT reporting and safeguards for customer assets against theft and deterioration of value. It is also important to note that the UK might have left the EU but has to abide by legislation for crypto in the EU, such as regulatory policies for AML and CFT. The UK Treasury announced in January 2021 that it would add certain crypto assets to the scope of financial promotions regulation.\n\nStart learning about cryptocurrencies with world’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts!\n\nThe concerns regarding cryptocurrency regulations around the world have become major topics of discussion in the crypto landscape. It is important to note that countries such as the US and the UK are not the only ones taking the initiative for crypto regulations. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies gains momentum across every country in the world, the demand for regulations has been growing continuously. You must familiarize yourself with the state of crypto regulations in different countries of the world and explore their implications. The mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies depends on the implementation of regulations that would earn more credibility for the crypto landscape.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The two most prominent techniques that define the functionalities of large language models or LLMs include fine-tuning and transfer learning. Each technique is useful for pre-trained large language models. Before diving into the transfer learning vs fine-tuning debate, it is important to note that both approaches help users leverage the knowledge in pre-trained models.\n\nInterestingly, you must note that transfer learning is also a type of fine-tuning, and the best way to explain it is to consider it full fine-tuning. Even if they are interconnected, transfer learning and fine-tuning serve distinct objectives for training fundamental LLMs. Let us learn more about the differences between them with detailed impression of the implications of both techniques.\n\n\n\nThe best way to find answers to “What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?” involves learning about the two techniques. Transfer learning is an important concept in the use of large language models or LLMs. It involves the use of pre-trained LLMs on new tasks. Transfer learning leverages the existing pre-trained LLMs from LLM families such as GPT, BERT, and others who were trained for a specific task.\n\nFor example, BERT is tailored for Natural Language Understanding, while GPT is created for Natural Language Generation. Transfer learning takes these LLMs and tailors them for a different target task with prominent similarities. The target task can be a domain-specific variation of the source task.\n\nThe primary objective in transfer learning revolves around using the knowledge obtained from the source task to achieve enhanced performance on target tasks. It is useful in scenarios where you have limited labeled data to achieve the target task. You must also note that you don’t have to pre-train the LLM from scratch.\n\nYou can dive deeper into the transfer learning vs. fine-tuning comparison by accounting for the training scope in transfer learning. In transfer learning, only the latter layers, including the parameters of the model, are selected for training. On the other hand, the early layers and the related parameters are frozen as they represent universal features such as textures and edges.\n\nThe training method used in transfer learning is also known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning or PEFT. It is important to note that PEFT techniques freeze almost all the parameters of the pre-trained parameter. On the other hand, the techniques only implement fine-tuning for a restricted set of parameters. You must also remember that transfer learning involves a limited number of strategies, such as PEFT methods.\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nThe most important highlight required to uncover insights on the fine-tuning vs. transfer learning debate refers to the working of transfer learning. You can understand the working mechanism of transfer learning in three distinct stages. The first stage in the working of transfer learning involves identification of the pre-trained LLM. You should choose a pre-trained model that has used a large dataset for training to address tasks in a general domain. For example, a BERT model.\n\nIn the next stage, you have to determine the target task for which you want to implement transfer learning on the LLM. Make sure that the task aligns with the source task in some form. For example, it could be about classification of contract documents or resumes for recruiters. The final stage of training LLMs through transfer learning involves performing domain adaptation. You can use the pre-trained model as an initial point for target task.

Transfer learning is the ideal pick for scenarios when the new task domain is almost similar to the original or source task domain. It involves a small new dataset that utilizes the knowledge of the pre-trained model on larger datasets.\n\nFine-tuning is considered more effective in scenarios where the new dataset is significantly large, as it helps the model learn specific features required for the new task. In addition, the new dataset must have a direct connection with the original dataset.\n\nThe discussions about the transfer learning vs. fine-tuning comparison draw attention to the requirement of computing resources. Transfer learning involves limited use of computational resources as it is a resource-efficient approach. The working principle of transfer learning focuses on updating only a small portion of the LLM.\n\nIt needs limited processing power and memory, thereby offering the assurance of faster training time. Therefore, transfer learning is the ideal recommendation for scenarios where you have to train LLMs with limited computational resources and faster experimentation.\n\nFine-tuning works by updating all model parameters. As a result, it requires more computational resources and consumes more time. Fine-tuning utilizes more processing power and memory alongside increasing the training times, which increases for larger models. Full fine-tuning generally needs a large amount of GPU RAM, which piles up the costs for the process of training LLMs.\n\nHere’s is an comparison table on transfer learning vs fine tuning.\n\n\n\nThe comparison between fine-tuning and transfer learning helps in uncovering the significance of the two training approaches. You have to find important highlights in the fine-tuning vs. transfer learning comparison, as they are crucial tools for optimizing LLMs. Transfer learning and fine-tuning can help in tailoring large language models to achieve specific tasks, albeit with crucial differences.

    "content": "Bitcoin played a major role in introducing cryptocurrencies to the world. It works using the Proof of Work mechanism that involves cryptocurrency mining. The fundamentals of cryptocurrency mining explained for beginners suggest that it is an essential requirement for releasing new tokens into circulation. You can find the best explanation for cryptocurrency mining and how crypto mining works by taking the example of Bitcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, people also think about the costs of mining cryptocurrencies, as you would need expensive mining rigs. At the same time, it is also important to consider the costs of electricity for cryptocurrency mining before investing your time and efforts in it. Let us learn more about crypto mining, using the example of Bitcoin, and whether it will still be profitable in 2024.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nCryptocurrency mining refers to the process through which transactions are officially added to the blockchain network. It also helps add new cryptocurrencies to the circulation supply. Bitcoin serves as the best reference to understand ‘what is cryptocurrency mining’ as it does not depend on third parties for verifying transactions. On the contrary, it relies on Bitcoin miners for securing and confirming transactions. Bitcoin blockchain uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to confirm a new block of transactions.\n\nMiners have to compete against each other to verify the 10-minute block and earn the newly minted Bitcoin as a rewards. The existing reward for Bitcoin mining is 6.25 BTC, and according to the current prices, it can be worth more than $162,000. The process to mine cryptocurrency involves solving a cryptographic puzzle to verify a mining block. However, miners would need high-end computing hardware to solve the cryptographic puzzles. Since many miners would join the competition, the first one to solve the puzzle would win the block reward.\n\nBitcoin mining, or crypto mining, is extremely competitive, and miners with the most powerful computing resources have the best chance of earning a minting reward. Apart from the upfront cost of setting up a crypto-mining machine, you should also consider other ongoing costs. For example, crypto or Bitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of electricity. On top of it, there is always the possibility of someone outpacing you to solve the puzzle and earn rewards. Therefore, the profitability of cryptocurrency mining definitely comes under question in the crypto industry.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks.\n\nCryptocurrency mining, or Bitcoin mining, is a complex effort and requires a significant upfront investment. Therefore, it is important to understand how crypto mining works before you proceed towards becoming a miner. You must take a look at the following aspects of the working mechanism of crypto or Bitcoin mining.\n\nCryptocurrencies are decentralized and don’t work under the control of a single individual or entity. It is different from the traditional payment systems. Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to verify and process transactions without involving an intermediary.\n\nProof of Work consensus leverages cryptography to maintain security and decentralization of transactions. It calls for solving a cryptographic equation to verify correctness of transactions. There are many cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Work consensus mechanism, such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin, and Monero.\n\nAnother important detail that comes up in discussions around ‘Is crypto mining worth it?’ is the hashing power. It is the amount of computational power that crypto miners can generate. With more computational power, miners can make more calculations when they try to solve the cryptographic equations. In the case of Bitcoin, miners would need 10 minutes to solve the cryptographic puzzles.\n\nDuring these 10 minutes, miners can leverage a ‘trial and error’ process. The hashing power of a miner determines the speed and the number of attempts miners can make for the ‘trial and error’ process. However, you would require more energy for more hashing power, thereby increasing the cost of crypto mining. On top of that, there is no way to guarantee that you will be 100% successful in earning the mining reward.\n\nCryptocurrency mining puzzles are difficult and complex for humans. The workings of cryptocurrency mining explained to beginners cite the necessity of high-end mining equipment. It can help generate the hashing power required to solve the cryptographic equations and add blocks of transaction to the network. The growing popularity of Bitcoin has led to a rise in the difficulty of mining operations.\n\nTherefore, mining equipment for crypto mining changed from CPUs to GPUs and then to application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. ASICs offer unparalleled speed and can generate massive amounts of hashing power for crypto mining. However, it is important to note that advanced ASICs cost thousands of dollars, and you would need more than one ASIC device for successful crypto mining.\n\nExcited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe next crucial thing that you must learn about cryptocurrency mining is the difficulty of the mining process. The definitions for ‘what is cryptocurrency mining’ reflect briefly on how it can be a difficult process with cryptographic puzzles. Mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the cryptographic puzzle that you must solve for the mining process.\n\nFaster mining of blocks can compromise the security of Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, the network would become inefficient when the mining process takes more time. Therefore, Bitcoin automatically adjusts the mining difficulty to achieve its 10-minute block target. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty is adjusted at a period of almost 14 days.\n\nThe best thing to find answers to “Is crypto mining worth it?” is the rewards that you get for crypto mining. The first miner to solve the cryptographic puzzle wins the mining reward in the form of newly mined Bitcoins. Initially, the mining reward for Bitcoin miners was 50 BTC initially.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin halving event reduces the mining rewards by half every four years. The last halving in 2020 reduced the mining rewards to 6.25 BTC, which is still the norm. With 2024 already here, Bitcoin miners can expect the reward to drop by half once again.\n\nWant to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course\n\nIf you are thinking about the profitability of crypto mining, then you must be disappointed. The Bitcoin halving phenomenon would bring down the mining rewards to half of 6.25 BTC. However, the rewards for the mine cryptocurrency would still be higher as the mining reward would be more than $80,000 according to existing Bitcoin and USD prices. On the other hand, it is important to note that cryptocurrency mining is almost similar to mining physical assets, such as gold, in some ways. Growing asset prices imply more profitability of crypto mining.\n\nAt the same time, it is also important to consider different factors other than the price of cryptocurrencies to evaluate profitability of Bitcoin mining. For example, rising prices of electricity, energy, and gas are some factors that influence profitability of cryptocurrency mining. Bitcoin mining requires a significant amount of electricity consumption in a year, which can surpass the annual energy consumption of a small country like Norway. Is cryptocurrency mining profitable amidst these trends? Interestingly, there are some trends that indicate that crypto mining will still be a profitable venture in 2024.\n\nThe cost of crypto mining equipment is one of the major aspects of how crypto mining works and the rewards it can offer miners. However, the price of ASIC devices reached all-time highs in 2022, with each unit selling for almost $10,000 to $18,000. Interestingly, the price of ASIC devices has declined by around 70%, thereby indicating favorable trends for mining profitability. On top of it, reduced Bitcoin prices encourage less efficient miners to shut down their operations. Therefore, more efficient miners can achieve more profitability with the fall of Bitcoin prices.\n\nNetwork hashrate or hashing power is also one of the notable factors that determine cryptocurrency mining profitability. The hashrate of a crypto mining machine represents the number of calculations it can perform in one second. You can find out the profitability of Bitcoin mining in the form of hash price, represented in the form of USD/TH or terahashes per second per day.\n\nSome of the prominent influences on the hashing price include Bitcoin price, transaction fees, block subsidy, and network difficulty. Interestingly, it is important to note that the total mining activity is still at an all-time high despite the drop in profitability of Bitcoin mining.\n\nStart learning about cryptocurrencies with world’s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts!\n\nThe complexities in cryptocurrency mining have created a lot of doubts about the effectiveness of the process. Most importantly, it is important to note that you cannot be completely sure about receiving rewards for mining. You can mine cryptocurrency with assurance of better profitability by following certain best practices. Here are the most effective strategies recommended for profitable crypto mining in 2024.\n\nASICs are the most trusted tools for achieving maximum profits from crypto mining. However, it is important to verify the authenticity of the mining equipment before you buy and use them.\n\nCloud mining is also another trusted method for reducing the costs of cryptocurrency mining. It allows users to rent hardware for mining without the resources and technical expertise required for mining operations.\n\nSome of the guides on cryptocurrency mining explained for beginners also point toward the possibilities for using mining pools. Mining pools help miners in combining their resources to increase the probabilities of mining blocks. In addition, mining pools offer lower returns, albeit with the assurance of more consistency.\n\nCryptocurrency market is significantly volatile, and the prices could change drastically. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the crypto market and the changing prices to modify your mining strategies to achieve more profits.\n\nEmbrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path\n\nThe profitability of cryptocurrency mining is still one of the prominent concerns in the crypto landscape. It has served as a profitable venture for many users. On the other hand, many have failed and incurred losses due to cryptocurrency mining. If you understand how crypto mining works and have a deep understanding of the crypto market, you can find the ideal way to execute crypto mining. However, mining rewards are not the only thing you should consider when evaluating profitability of crypto mining. Learn more about cryptocurrency mining and find the best ways to become a crypto miner right now.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The growth of blockchain technology has invited attention to many significant advancements. Cryptocurrencies made their presence felt in the financial markets worldwide, and blockchain technology made headlines everywhere. Was blockchain limited to cryptocurrencies only? No, different blockchain platforms were working on their unique and innovative offerings.\n\nAny smart contract code example can help you understand how smart contract functionality changed the blockchain landscape permanently. Developers can leverage smart contracts to come up with complex applications that follow the decentralized approach. Solidity is one of the most popular programming languages for creating smart contracts, especially for Ethereum. Interestingly, Solidity ensures that smart contract functionality is universally available. Let us learn about different examples of Solidity smart contract code and their significance.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nYou must be wondering why you must learn the examples of smart contracts in Solidity. The best reason to learn Solidity smart contract examples is the power that Ethereum holds over the blockchain industry. Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce smart contract programmability with the help of Solidity.\n\nProgramming smart contracts on Ethereum was not as easy as it is now because only a few programmers were fluent in the EVM architecture. Solidity emerged as a promising solution to help developers in the construction of decentralized applications. The first version of Solidity was launched in 2021 and has been serving as a major force for transformation of smart contract development experience for users.\n\nSolidity helped in solving many problems associated with smart contract development, such as compatibility and scalability. The best Solidity smart contract examples can show you how Solidity has reduced the overall difficulty in smart contract development process. Smart contract development with conventional programming languages was a clumsy and complex process.\n\nSolidity served as the next big solution for simplification of smart contract development. It has removed complexity by ensuring a direct association of its syntax and structure with EVM. Solidity ensures translation of written code to EVM codes, thereby ensuring better convenience for developers.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n\nThe importance of Solidity for smart contract development provides a clear impression of the reasons for its popularity. You must be curious about queries like “How do you write a smart contract in Solidity?” after learning the importance of Solidity. The code of Solidity has to be encapsulated in contracts.\n\nSmart contracts or contracts in Solidity include a collection of code or its relevant functions and data or its relevant state, residing at a particular address on Ethereum blockchain. Contracts serve as fundamental blocks for application development on Ethereum. Here are two examples of Solidity smart contract codes that can give you a basic idea of how they work and the components in Solidity code.\n\nLearn about the fundamentals of smart contracts and solidity with Solidity \u0026 Smart Contracts E-Book\n\nThe best Solidity contract example to start with is a simple example like the ‘helloWorld’ examples for other programming languages. Here’s what a simple, smart contract looks like in Solidity.\n\nThe code example features one method, “helloWorld ().” The method returns the “HelloWorld !. This is your first Contract” string as the output.\n\nExcited to learn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development, Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nAnother notable addition among the top Solidity smart contract examples is the smart contract, in which you can use the set () and get () functions. The following example uses the set () function to set the value of the state variable in the smart contract. On the other hand, the get () function can help in obtaining the set value from the contract.\n\nLet us break down this smart contract code example to understand how you can also create a contract with Solidity. Here are the important components that you must note in the contract code example.\n\nThe smart contract code starts with pragmas, which serve as instructions for the compiler on how it must treat the code. Every Solidity source code must begin with the ‘version pragma’ that officially declares the version of Solidity compiler it would use. The use of version pragma in this Solidity contract example proves its functionality in any Solidity contract code. It helps prevent any compatibility issues with the future versions of the compiler that may feature some changes. In this example, you can notice that the code is compatible with compilers with a version more than 0.4.16 and less than 0.9.0 version.\n\nThe ‘contract Storage { }’ component of the code draws attention to the contract keyword. It serves a valuable role in declaring a contract that would encapsulate the code.\n\nAnother common highlight in answers to “How do you write a smart contract in Solidity?” draws attention to state variables. In this example, you can notice state variables in the line,\n\nuint public setData;\n\nState variables are permanent additions to the contract storage and are written directly to the Ethereum blockchain. The concerned line in the code example provides a declaration of a state variable “setData” with the type ‘uint’ or an unsigned integer of 256 bits. You can think of the line as a method for addition of slots in a database.\n\nThe most crucial highlight in a smart contract code example is the function declaration, which looks like the following,\n\nYou can notice these two functions at distinct parts of the smart contract code. First of all, you have a function ‘set,’ which has a public access modifier type. The function would take variable x of uint data type as the parameter. It can serve as an essential addition to a simple, smart contract for updating the value of “setData.”\n\nThe function allows anyone to call and overwrite the value of “setData” stored in Ethereum blockchain without any barriers. Therefore, you would have a completely decentralized and censorship-resistant smart contract, which would be unaffected by centralized server shutdowns.\n\nAre you aspiring to learn the fundamentals of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and smart contracts’ upgradability? Enroll now in the Advanced Solidity Development Course.\n\nThe simple example of Solidity contracts showcases the fundamentals you need to find your way through Solidity contract development. On the contrary, you can seek the top Solidity smart contract examples that cater to emerging requirements. The examples can not only help you understand the power of Solidity but also help you level up your game in Solidity programming. Here are some of the notable examples of Solidity smart contracts for different purposes.\n\nERC-20 token standard is a mandatory addition to the checklist of every aspiring Solidity developer. It helps in defining a specific set of rules for creation of fungible tokens. Here is an example of an ERC-20 token contract in Solidity.\n\nThe next addition among best Solidity smart contract examples would draw the limelight on ERC-721 tokens. You can use ERC-721 standard for creating NFTs. Here is an example of an ERC-721 token contract on Solidity.\n\nYou can also create online auctions on the blockchain with Solidity smart contracts. Developers can leverage a simple auction contract for this purpose. The contract can help bidders compete for items, and the highest bidder will win when the auction ends. Here is an example of a general auction contract you can create in Solidity.\n\nStart your journey to become a smart contract developer or architect with an in-depth overview of smart contract fundamentals, Enroll Now in Smart Contracts Skill Path\n\nThe review of Solidity smart contract examples reveals that it is a straightforward and simple programming language.

Let us learn more about the mandatory steps that can guide you through the process of launching a web3 project.\n\n\n\nThe success of web3 projects such as dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and DAOs has caught everyone’s attention in the technology domain. Businesses want to tap into the benefits of web3, while entrepreneurs want to shape new business ideas around web3. However, the launch of web3 project is a multi-faceted journey in which you have to address different requirements.\n\nFor example, entrepreneurs must complete conceptualization, tokenomics design, navigation through legal terrains, and development of a strong community. On top of it, you must also invest efforts in regular assessment and iteration to ensure longevity and success of the project. Here is an outline of the different steps involved in the roadmap to launch a web3 project.\n\nThe foundation of a successful web3 project depends on comprehensive research and a strong conceptual framework. You can create a web3 startup on the basis of a groundbreaking idea. However, it is also important to understand the feasibility, potential impact, and relevance of the idea in the market. In addition, you must note that conceptualization and research is an iterative process. You have to generate ideas, test them, and refine the ideas continuously to create an innovative and user-centric web3 project.\n\nThe conceptualization stage begins with generation of ideas and identification of problems. You have to identify the gaps or pain points that you want to address with web3. Imagine the different ways in which blockchain and web3 technologies can offer solutions to the identified problems.\n\nThe ideation stage also requires brainstorming sessions with experts, stakeholders, and potential users to create and refine ideas. The answers to “How do I launch a web3 project?” also emphasize market research in which you have to understand the target audience. On top of that, you also need a competitive analysis and trend analysis to understand competitors and new trends on web3.\n\nThe next crucial concern in the conceptualization phase is the feasibility study. It focuses on checking the technical and economic feasibility of your ideas for web3 projects.

Remember to include the pain points and goals of your target users in the user persona.\n\nIn the next step, you have to create a feedback loop, which begins with development of a basic prototype. You have to ask a small group of target users to use the prototype and offer feedback on value and usability. Feedback from users can help discover areas for improvement and ensure that the final product meets users’ needs and expectations.\n\nGet familiar with the terms related to Web 3.0 with Web 3.0 Flashcards\n\nThe technical foundation of a web3 project serves as its backbone. It is one of the important steps for a successful web3 project launch as it focuses on determining the overall user experience, functionality, and security of the project. You need a robust technical infrastructure for your web3 project to adapt effectively to the rapid changes in web3 market.\n\nThe first step in establishing a strong technical foundation for your web3 project requires selection of a blockchain platform. You have to evaluate different blockchain platforms according to your project requirements. Some of the important factors that you must consider when choosing a blockchain platform for your web3 project include scalability, interoperability, and throughput.\n\nThe technical foundation of your web3 project also requires smart contracts. It is important to create modular, upgradeable, and reusable smart contracts for flexibility and longevity. On top of it, you must employ regular smart contract audits to prevent negative impact of security vulnerabilities. At the same time, you must pay attention to optimization of the smart contract code to reduce gas consumption.\n\nAnother crucial requirement in technical infrastructure for web3 project launch is decentralized application development. Make sure that your apps have a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with underlying smart contracts. You must also ensure cross-platform compatibility of dApps to ensure better accessibility of your web3 project.\n\nThe technical infrastructure of your web3 project must also focus on the use of decentralized storage solutions and Oracle integration. Decentralized data storage solutions such as IPFS can offer better censorship resistance alongside ensuring data integrity. On top of it, you would need Oracle integrations to help your web3 project source data from real world. It is important to choose decentralized oracle networks to reduce single points of failure and prevent risks of oracle manipulation.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nTokenomics is a combination of ‘token’ and ‘economics’ that involves economic systems and models related to blockchain-based tokens. Tokenomics is important for the launch of web3 project as it helps in determining the value, overall functionality, and utility of tokens in the web3 ecosystem.\n\nFirst of all, you must establish the purpose of the token that you want in your web3 project. You can find different types of tokens, such as utility tokens, security tokens, stablecoins, and governance tokens. Each type of token serves a distinct purpose, and you should pick the token type that best suits your project goals.\n\nThe distribution and supply of your web3 project token are also crucial steps in determining the tokenomics of the project. Some of the common methods for token distribution include Initial Coin Offering, Security Token Offering, airdrops, and rewards and incentives. Entrepreneurs who want to create a web3 startup must also choose whether their token would be inflationary or deflationary. It is also important to decide whether you want a fixed supply or a variable maximum limit of tokens.\n\nThe tokenomics for your web3 project also requires an emphasis on token valuation, token security, and token liquidity. In the token valuation process, you have to check the demand and utility of the token alongside its perceived value. You must also pay attention to the scarcity of the token that can enhance its value.\n\nWeb3 project founders must also emphasize token security by checking regulatory compliance and implementing comprehensive smart contract audits. Successful web3 projects also stand out for offering the benefits of token liquidity. For example, you have to list your tokens on reputed crypto exchanges and liquidity pools for decentralized trading.\n\nThe steps for a successful web3 project launch also emphasize the necessity of a clear definition for economic models and governance of tokenomics. Some of the common highlights in the economic model of your web3 project would include staking, yield farming, and burn mechanisms. On the other hand, you can also choose to empower token holders with privilege to participate in governance of the project. Furthermore, token-based voting can also serve as a useful tool for effective, secure, and transparent treasury management.\n\n\n\nThe legal aspects related to web3 are continuously evolving. Governments and regulatory authorities all over the world have been trying to find their way around web3 regulations. However, the answers to “How do I launch a web3 project?” would be incomplete without referring to legal requirements of the project.\n\nFor example, regulatory authorities perceive Initial Coin Offerings and Security Token Offerings as securities, thereby subjecting them to investor protection laws and disclosure requirements. Web3 projects must also register and obtain a license for conducting an ICO or STO.\n\nThe legal and regulatory implications of a web3 project also emphasize the elements of AML and KYC verification alongside addressing the data protection and privacy requirements. You must also pay attention to cross-border challenges, such as jurisdictional issues and tax implications in different countries.\n\nOn top of it, you must also address the important steps of trademarking and branding alongside licensing smart contract IP. It is important to stay updated with the regulatory landscape in web3 and understand how it can affect your web3 project.\n\nThe community of your web3 project is not just the audience for your innovative solution. On the contrary, the community serves as the primary driver of adoption, long-term sustainability, and innovation in your web3 projects. With a strong community, you can have contributors, decision-makers, and advocates for your web3 startup.\n\nThe foremost step for community building when you create a web3 startup, involves understanding your audience. Subsequently, you must invest efforts in choosing the right platforms, such as social media, content platforms, and forums to interact with community members. These platforms can serve as the foundations to build a strong web3 community.\n\nThe most important requirements for building a strong community around your web3 project focus on encouraging open communication and engagement with quality content. It is important to encourage feedback from community members with complete transparency, which can build trust in the community.\n\nOn top of it, quality content such as educational resources, user-generated content, and updates and announcements can ensure credibility of the community.

    "content": "Cryptocurrencies are no longer limited to the tables of tech enthusiasts. The initial fears regarding losing money to cryptocurrency value fluctuations created many doubts in the minds of users. However, the popularity of Bitcoin soared by huge margins in a limited period of time, thereby encouraging more people to pay attention to cryptocurrencies.\n\nInterestingly, the popularity of Bitcoin is one of the reasons for growth in momentum of the Bitcoin vs. Altcoins debate due to the rise of many altcoins. Cryptocurrencies have become one of the major topics in mainstream discussions on finance and have become the frontrunners of a revolutionary change in the financial services landscape. Let us take a look at the differences between Bitcoin and altcoins to find the better alternative among them.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe first thing you need to learn before comparing Bitcoin with altcoins is the awareness of Bitcoin fundamentals. You can find effective answers to the question, “Is Bitcoin better than altcoins?” by learning about the fundamental identity of Bitcoin. The origins of Bitcoin changed the cryptocurrency landscape and showed that virtual currencies can be decentralized.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto transformed the conventional notions about money with his new invention in 2009 and provided the foundations for rise of a massive industry. Bitcoin is the first-ever cryptocurrency, and it is still one of the most valuable and recognized digital currencies in the market today.\n\nBitcoin works through the power of blockchain technology. It offers a public distributed ledger that includes transaction data from everyone using Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain allows addition of transactions to the blocks, which are subsequently linked to a chain of blocks featuring previous Bitcoin transactions.\n\nYou can understand the debate on altcoins vs. Bitcoin more clearly by identifying how Bitcoin provided one of the earliest forms of virtual currency based on blockchain. As a matter of fact, the world embraced the concept of blockchain after learning about working mechanism of Bitcoin.\n\nEvery transaction on Bitcoin blockchain is verifiable. Bitcoin network also leverages encryption that helps individuals all over the world exchange information and engage in financial transactions. At the same time, Bitcoin opened the doors for anonymous and secure transactions.\n\nThe relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins also emphasizes the element of decentralization. Without the governance of a central authority, Bitcoin is free from unwanted influence. Another important trait of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is fixed at 21 million BTC. As a result, Bitcoin has become a scarce asset, and its value has increased with time.\n\nEnroll now in the Bitcoin Technology Course to learn about Bitcoin mining and the information contained in transactions and blocks\n\nBitcoin started a revolution of cryptocurrencies and pushed for the rise of new types of cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. Any review of Bitcoin and altcoins emphasizes the fact that any type of cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin can be classified as altcoins. Many altcoins have arrived in the market following a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain and other blockchains such as Ethereum. The primary objective of altcoins revolves around resolution of specific issues, such as security limitations and problems with transaction speed.\n\nOne of the first examples of altcoins is Litecoin. It was a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain network and was formed in 2011. Without the presence of a substantial number of competitors to Bitcoin, the term ‘altcoin’ became the top choice for describing new arrivals in the cryptocurrency market. Apart from Ethereum, many other altcoins made their mark in the industry. Some of the popular examples of altcoins with high market capitalization include Binance Smart Chain and Ripple.\n\nThe difference between altcoins and Bitcoin also invites attention to the classification of altcoins into different categories. The most popular variants of altcoins include stablecoins, utility tokens, and security tokens. Each type of altcoin has a distinct functionality and plays a vital role in strengthening the web3 ecosystem. Stablecoins are one of the most popular types of altcoins, which have been pegged to another asset with a fixed value. The most popular examples of stablecoins include USD Coin and Tether or USDT.\n\nAltcoin variants also include utility tokens and security tokens. Utility tokens are used on specific blockchains as payment tokens or for the execution of specific tasks and access to particular features on the platform. On the other hand, security tokens are altcoins that serve as digital representations of physical assets. Security tokens can also represent digital contracts that offer ownership of physical assets such as homes, cars, or stocks.\n\nExcited to know the use cases of crypto in NFTs, DeFi, and the metaverse, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course\n\nThe fundamentals of altcoins and Bitcoin provided a brief overview of the differences between them.

    "content": "Blockchain technology has induced a major revolution in the conventional approaches to financial transactions and data storage. On the other hand, it has also gained attention for a prominent challenge in the form of blockchain trilemma. The definition of blockchain trilemma explained by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, reflects on the problems it causes.\n\nMost importantly, it embodies the necessity of a trade-off between the three distinct aspects of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and scalability. Security is the collection of robust safeguards for blockchain networks. Scalability emphasizes the power of blockchain networks to accommodate more users and transactions without increasing transaction time and fees. The final element, decentralization, is a basic trait of blockchain and ensures equal distribution of power among all participants in the network.\n\nYou might wonder about the importance of blockchain trilemma for developers and how the trade-offs can affect the future of blockchain technology. The interplay between the three elements plays out dangerously as enhancing one of them diminishes the effect of another aspect. Most developers believe that achieving the desired balance between the three elements simultaneously is extremely difficult. Let us learn more about blockchain trilemma and discover the potential solutions to resolve the setbacks due to blockchain trilemma.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma serves as one of the major obstacles to adoption of blockchain and web3. The answers to “What is the blockchain trilemma?” reflect on the struggle to achieve optimal levels of scalability, security, and decentralization at the same time. Blockchain developers have to make compromises or trade-offs between the three elements to achieve desired results for their applications.\n\nThe general assumption in the blockchain landscape suggests that public blockchains could only achieve two of the three elements simultaneously. Blockchain developers have to choose the elements they want to prioritize to achieve the desired goals of their applications. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the blockchain trilemma can help determine the unique value proposition for blockchain developers.\n\nThe most important aspect of any blockchain network is the security it offers. Security is one of the cornerstones of blockchain trilemma and commands significant attention in the domain of blockchain. Any blockchain trilemma guide would emphasize the fact that a blockchain network must have the essential safeguards required for protection against malicious entities. It is a complex issue in blockchain networks, which are inherently decentralized and don’t have any central authority for supervising and protecting the system.\n\nYou can refer to the example of Bitcoin blockchain to understand how security works in a blockchain network. The Bitcoin blockchain utilizes a combination of Proof of Work consensus mechanism and cryptography to ensure security. The consensus mechanism ensures interconnection of data blocks in a completely tamper-proof manner. Any type of modification in the data would be detected immediately by the network.\n\nOn top of it, the system becomes more secure with the participation of more users or nodes in the network. With more participants in the network, it would become difficult for a single user or entity to gain control. Therefore, the blockchain network can ensure safeguards against potential threats such as 51% attacks.\n\nYou can unravel the significance of blockchain trilemma explained for beginners with the example of Bitcoin blockchain. It showed how a secure blockchain network ensures immutability and resists attacks from malicious entities. However, security can be one of the major deterrents to decentralization as you would have to increase hash power in mining under Proof of Work consensus.\n\nFor example, the Proof of Work consensus can increase the cost of mining alongside forcing the exit of smaller and less efficient mining setups. It can lead to centralization of miners, thereby leading to a trade-off with decentralization.\n\n\n\nThe next element in the blockchain trilemma is scalability. It is one of the prominent highlights in responses to “What is blockchain trilemma?” as it has become a major requirement for emerging blockchain solutions. Scalability is a major element that you have to emphasize in the development of blockchain networks. Scalability points to the ability of blockchain networks to manage continuously increasing volumes of transactions and the number of users without compromising transaction fees or speed.\n\nThe web3 revolution has increased the demand for new blockchain projects. On top of it, every blockchain project wants to achieve global reach, thereby emphasizing the need to manage billions of users simultaneously. Scalability can be a major challenge for projects, especially when you want the other two elements of the trilemma in security and decentralization.\n\nDevelopers come across troubles in the process of improving security and decentralization when they have to focus on scalability. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain can process only seven transactions per second. It is significantly inferior to the performance of centralized payment systems such as Visa, which has the capability to manage 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe stark contrast draws attention to the importance of blockchain trilemma and the inherent design of blockchain networks. For instance, the consensus mechanism in blockchain networks, such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, creates limitations. In the case of Proof of Work, you would have a secure but slow network. On the other hand, Proof of Stake requires processing of transactions by multiple participants, thereby slowing down the network.\n\nScalability is an important requirement for blockchain technology to complete its promises and serve as a viable alternative to centralized platforms. The existing throughput of blockchain networks is a major concern for achieving scalability. You can refer to a blockchain trilemma guide to understand how scalability can lead to significant trade-offs.\n\nOne of the proven methods to increase the processing speed and scalability of a network involves reducing the number of network validators responsible for verifying the transactions. However, such an approach stands against decentralization and reduces the trait of censorship resistance in blockchain.\n\nDevelopers can also lower the block time, which requires a reduction of the difficulty of the consensus protocol. In the example of Bitcoin blockchain, you would have to reduce the mining difficulty. For Ethereum blockchain, you have to lower the requirements for two-thirds consensus on the network. However, these trade-offs can lead to security problems.\n\nLearn about blockchain technology fundamentals, use cases, and enterprise blockchain platforms with this free Blockchain E-Book.\n\nDecentralization is the most prominent trait of any blockchain network and differentiates it from conventional centralized systems. Discussions around queries like “What is blockchain trilemma?” focus on decentralization as it represents one of the core themes of blockchain and web3.\n\nDecentralized blockchain networks are known for even distribution of control among different participants, thereby removing the need for central authorities. The distribution of control plays a vital role in enhancing transparency and fairness in a blockchain network. On top of it, the distribution of control also ensures resistance of blockchain networks to external manipulation and censorship.\n\nIt is also important to note that you cannot achieve decentralization without formidable challenges. For example, increasing the number of participants in a blockchain network improves decentralization in the network. On the other hand, it can lead to time-consuming processes to reach a consensus that can influence the scalability of the network.\n\nOn top of it, highly decentralized networks could also have to compromise on security as malicious entities could join the network easily and launch attacks. Therefore, decentralization can turn into a major weakness of a blockchain network rather than serving as its strength.\n\nCheck out the Blockchain Masterclass for a better understanding of the blockchain ecosystem and learn different use cases of blockchain in decentralized solutions.\n\nYou can understand the importance of blockchain trilemma with better clarity by reflecting on examples of the impact of trilemma. For example, Bitcoin is a popular blockchain network that utilizes the Proof of Work consensus. It can offer a significantly unparalleled level of security. However, the design of Bitcoin blockchain creates difficulties for scalability. With the creation of Bitcoin Cash in 2017 through forking, the Bitcoin community aimed to increase the block size and solve the scalability issues.\n\nBitcoin Cash turned out to be a successful initiative for increasing the transaction speed and lowering the transaction fees. On the contrary, Bitcoin Cash also led to another pitfall in the form of larger blocks, which require a complex mining process. Therefore, miners with advanced computing resources could only participate in Bitcoin mining, thereby sacrificing decentralization.\n\nAnother prominent example of a blockchain trilemma guide draws attention to Ripple blockchain. It is a useful platform to ensure efficient and faster cross-border payments. On the other hand, the Ripple blockchain network is more centralized than other blockchain networks.\n\nTherefore, it is more vulnerable to censorship control. Ripple managed the scalability problem through adoption of a different consensus mechanism. As compared to Ethereum or Bitcoin, Ripple blockchain works with a limited number of validators for verifying and confirming transactions. Therefore, Ripple has to sacrifice decentralization to achieve security and scalability.\n\n\n\nThe most crucial aspect that you can find in an account of blockchain trilemma explained for beginners is the outline of solutions for the trilemma. General approaches to solving the blockchain trilemma involve implementation of changes at layer 1 or base layer or through tools on layer 2 or on top of the base layer. Here is an overview of the important solutions to blockchain trilemma in each category.\n\nThe two most prominent layer 1 solutions to the blockchain trilemma include consensus protocol enhancements and sharding. One of the proven techniques to solve the blockchain trilemma revolves around changing the consensus mechanism of the network. The answers to “What is blockchain trilemma?” must also draw your attention towards the impact of changes in consensus mechanisms. For example, changing from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus can remove dependence on miner nodes. Ethereum is one of the biggest examples of such transition, as it announced ‘The Merge’ in 2022.\n\nSharding is also a viable layer 1 solution for addressing the blockchain trilemma problem. It is a type of horizontal partitioning or database management approach in which you can break data into shards or different pieces. You can store the shards in different locations, thereby freeing up more space for parallel transaction processing.\n\nThe insights into importance of blockchain trilemma also point to the possibilities for using layer 2 solutions to resolve the trilemma. Some of the proven layer 2 solutions include nested blockchains, sidechains, and state channels. Each approach provides a distinctive solution to improve scalability alongside safeguarding security and decentralization on the main network.\n\nStart learning blockchain with world’s first Blockchain Career Paths with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nThe definition of blockchain trilemma revolves around the three elements of security, decentralization, and scalability. It is important to use a blockchain trilemma guide before approaching any blockchain or web3 development project. The three elements in blockchain trilemma can have a significant influence on the functionality of your project.\n\nFor example, if you choose scalability for your app, then you might have to compromise the security of sensitive user information. On the other hand, democratization of control over the app can lead to scalability challenges. Explore the significance of blockchain trilemma with more practical examples and find the ideal solutions now.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The impact of technology has created a massive impact on different sectors, leading to the arrival of new use cases and trends. Blockchain is one of the top examples of such technologies that have changed different industries. The foremost industry which felt the impact of blockchain is the financial services industry. You are here to learn DeFi application development fundamentals because you know how blockchain has led to the decentralization of financial services. With the help of blockchain, the financial services industry has been moving towards decentralization as it removes the role of a centralized authority. Market reports have suggested that the DeFi market could grow beyond $232 billion by 2030. Businesses want to capitalize on the benefits of DeFi for simplifying financial transactions for their customers.\n\nDeFi, or decentralized finance, has been responsible for the transition of conventional processes in the domain of finance toward decentralized networks. Businesses can build a DeFi app for different reasons, including the development of new financial services solutions and offering new methods for conducting financial transactions. The most interesting thing about DeFi is the broader scope of opportunities associated with it. One of the major objectives of DeFi is the removal of intermediaries and emphasizing technology above everything else. Let us find out how you can build DeFi apps from scratch in the following DeFi development guide.\n\nEnroll now in the DeFi Development Course to understand the best ways to use DeFi development tools like Solidity, React, and Hardhat.\n\nOne of the first things that you should learn about decentralized finance development is the utility of DeFi apps. Decentralized finance or DeFi points at financial instruments, including services and applications developed on blockchain. DeFi solutions were created as an alternative to the traditional banking sector and to replace traditional financial services with modern technologies with the help of open-source protocols. Decentralized finance works with the help of blockchain technology and smart contracts to offer more transparent and accessible financial solutions. DeFi offers opportunities for interaction with cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and NFTs.\n\nImagine the possibilities of having a world where financial services are immediately accessible at your fingertips. You don’t have to worry about any central authority directly intervening with your data. The demand for a DeFi development guide has been increasing as more people and businesses want to tap into the potential of DeFi. Decentralized finance utilizes blockchain to offer a borderless approach in the domain of finance. You can take a loan, speculate on price shifts, obtain secure risk insurance, and trade in digital currencies with the help of DeFi.\n\nLearn about DeFi applications and how these work with the presentation on Top 5 DeFi Applications\n\nDeFi apps work by using blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized network that takes information in the form of blocks. The data blocks or blocks of transactions are chronologically arranged on a chain with the help of timestamps. As a result, the information becomes immutable, and the transactions become irreversible. The responses to “How do I start a DeFi development?” would also suggest that you must know the ways in which blockchain ensures public accessibility of the network. It can ensure the dependability and transparency of transactions associated with DeFi. What are the other aspects that separate DeFi applications from the crowd?\n\nConventional financial frameworks have ruled the domain of finance. You can learn the DeFi development guide to create solutions that can address the setbacks of centralized finance. The most critical setback of centralized finance is the involvement of central entities or institutions in the management and regulation of financial transactions. With the help of decentralization, DeFi apps reduce the dependency on intermediaries. It can help in creating an ecosystem that revolves around the elements of trust and transparency. Users can gain control over their transactions and remove potential setbacks with the help of DeFi.\n\nAnother important trait of DeFi apps points to interoperability, as DeFi protocols can interact with each other. It could help offer feature sharing, straightforward asset trading, and data exchange. Interoperability opens the doors for developing compound applications in which DeFi protocols can capitalize on the attributes of other protocols. As a result, interoperability empowers the rise of perspectives on developing a tightly knit and diverse DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe next crucial aspect you must understand to build a DeFi app is the assurance of non-custodial control. DeFi applications allow users to have non-custodial control over their assets. It means that users would have complete authority and ownership over their funds in all financial transactions. DeFi apps rely on smart contracts to ensure that users are in control of their assets.\n\nDeFi applications utilize smart contracts that operate on blockchain networks. Smart contracts serve an important role in the automation of financial transactions and other tasks for DeFi. Developers can use autonomous smart contracts to enable complex financial tasks. In addition, decentralized finance development ensures that all financial operations work seamlessly. Furthermore, smart contracts can also adapt to different types of circumstances and requirements for offering financial services.\n\nThe list of distinctive traits of DeFi apps also draws attention to the capability of DeFi apps for liquidity provision. DeFi platforms help users in depositing their assets in liquidity pools to obtain reward tokens or interest. The pooled resources facilitate liquidity to the DeFi platforms to enable borrowing and seamless trading operations. With a decentralized approach, the liquidity provision in DeFi apps is considerably different from traditional finance methodologies.\n\n\n\nThe most notable highlight of a DeFi development guide is the description of the functionalities you need in DeFi apps. Apart from the benefits of independence and decentralization, DeFi applications can help in serving a broad range of applications. The use cases of DeFi prioritize the transformation of conventional financial processes. Here is an outline of the different functionalities of DeFi.\n\nStablecoins represent a stable group of assets in the DeFi landscape. The riskiest trait of any cryptocurrency is the higher volatility, which creates confusion for investors. Stablecoins work by pegging their value to reserve assets, which makes them one of the most revolutionary crypto assets.\n\nDeFi tokens mined on pre-existing blockchains are also an important aspect you would come across when you learn DeFi development best practices. In addition, DeFi tokens can be pegged against an underlying asset, such as fiat currency or gold.\n\nLiquidity mining is also an important highlight in the DeFi ecosystem. Also known as yield farming, it involves the use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate liquidity. For example, decentralized exchanges utilize Automated Market Maker to facilitate effective regulation of trading activities. Users can swap tokens for trading cryptocurrencies in the liquidity pool to earn passive income.\n\nDeFi exchanges can help users in trading cryptocurrencies without the involvement of third-party intermediaries. The DeFi exchange apps leverage smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer and direct trading.\n\nThe functionalities of DeFi also include staking, which utilizes idle coins to support the validation of cryptographic transactions. You must learn that staking is possible with the Proof of Stake consensus that focuses on ownership stake rather than the proof of work.\n\nPeople who want to find answers to “How do I start a DeFi development?” must also pay attention to the functionalities of borrowing and lending in DeFi apps. DeFi has been creating different alternatives to traditional finance use cases, and lending and borrowing apps are one of the top examples of this. Smart contracts serve as the technological intermediary in such apps, thereby ensuring that the lenders and borrowers follow all the conditions.\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem also includes wallets as one of the notable additions for exploring a different perspective on decentralized finance. Cryptocurrencies are still in the initial stage and need central authorities, such as a digital wallet. Digital wallets are responsible for holding the key in the process of exchanging cryptocurrencies. DeFi wallets could help users exercise complete control over their assets and keys.\n\nCatch up on the latest trends in DeFi and its connection to crypto with Decentralized Finance Skill Path\n\nThe growing popularity of DeFi development has invited attention to the creation of innovative DeFi solutions.

    "content": "A contract refers to an agreement that exists between two or more parties which contains certain terms for exchanging value between them. These agreements may be legally binding, depending on whether they are in oral form or in writing. In the digital realm, contracts serve an instrumental role as they influence how transactions and businesses take place. Contracts play an indispensable role in the blockchain domain. Undoubtedly, without a contract, it is impossible to think of transactions that take place within blockchain networks.\n\nContracts have undergone considerable changes with time. Previously, traditional contracts played a domineering role. However, the emergence of the concept of smart contracts has taken the digital world by storm. Before understanding smart contracts vs traditional contracts differences, you must understand what these contracts are exactly.\n\n\n\nTraditional contracts serve as legally binding documents between two or more parties. These contracts contain the terms and conditions relating to transactions or associations between them. The core components of a traditional contract are offer, intention, acceptance, and consideration. Some of the key characteristics of traditional contracts include:\n\nTraditional contracts are enforceable in a court of law. Since these contracts encompass thorough legal elements, the association between the parties is obligatory.\n\nIn the case of traditional contracts, handling disputes is relatively simple. Undoubtedly, the existence of dispute resolution systems assists in the resolution of conflicting situations.\n\nIntermediaries or third parties play a key role in traditional contracts. For instance, lawyers play a key role when it comes to drafting the terms and conditions of such contracts.\n\nDue to the involvement of third parties, the parties depend on them to ensure confidentiality. The contracts may contain confidentiality clauses to make sure that privacy exists for confidential information.\n\nThe elements of automation are limited in traditional contracts. The involvement of manual processes and involvement is high in these kinds of contracts. Thus, it increases the possibility of error due to human involvement.\n\nTraditional contracts are prone to tampering, which acts as a major shortcoming. In such paper-based contracts, the possibility of forgery exists. Similarly, there is also a possibility that such contracts may get lost, thereby causing disputes between the parties.\n\nCurious to understand the complete smart contract development lifecycle? Enroll now in the Smart Contracts Development Course\n\nToday, smart contracts are one of the most popular inventions in the blockchain universe. These contracts are self-executing programs that exist on blockchain networks. The chief considerations that exist in such contracts are consideration, subject, and capacity. Before diving into smart contracts vs traditional contracts, you need to get familiar with the features of smart contracts.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing, which implies that they can automatically run after the fulfillment of specific conditions. This feature in smart contracts eliminates the reliance on human intervention or involvement.\n\nOne of the main highlights of smart contracts is the high transparency that they offer. The decentralized dimension of blockchain technology makes it transparent, thereby enhancing trust.\n\nAfter the deployment of a smart contract, modification is not possible. Clearly, this feature makes it a tamper-proof contract. The immutability feature ensures that no manipulation of smart contracts takes place. In case any change is made, it will lead to an entirely different hash result.\n\nIn smart contracts, there is no involvement of any intermediaries. Due to this, the level of autonomy for the parties is high. The execution and maintenance of smart contracts take place by the nodes on the blockchain network. Thus, there is no unequal distribution of power between any parties.\n\nSmart contracts are self-verifiable contracts. The automated elements in these contracts ensure that the verification does not require any kind of manual involvement.\n\nAs smart contracts exist within blockchain networks, there is no risk of losing them. Their backup remains in the network, which minimizes the possibility of loss or misplacement of the contracts.\n\nLearn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development with the Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nNow that you are more familiar with smart and traditional contracts, it is time to explore their differences. By understanding the differences between the two, you can know how smart contracts are revolutionizing the blockchain universe. The chief differences between smart contracts and traditional contracts arise in terms of automation, transparency, speed, immutability, and cost.\n\n\n\nAre you wondering – How smart contracts are different from traditional contracts? If so, you must note that a fundamental difference arises on the basis of autonomy. Smart contracts can be automatically executed. Obviously, this is possible due to their self-executing property. When specific conditions and terms are met, the execution of such contracts takes place naturally.\n\nThe automation aspect makes smart contracts highly efficient in comparison to traditional contracts. Moreover, it also eliminates the need to depend on an intermediary. The traditional contracts, as the name suggests, are conventional. Due to this, these contracts cannot be automatically executed.\n\nThey entirely rely on manual involvement. Hence, it takes more time to execute traditional contracts. The dependence on humans’ role in traditional contracts makes them time-consuming. In the blockchain setting, smart contracts are a perfect fit that facilitates a large number of transactions on the network.\n\nAnother key aspect that you must take into consideration regarding traditional contracts vs. smart contracts revolves around transparency. Smart contracts are totally transparent types of contracts. Hence, all the parties are capable of viewing the terms of the contract at all times. It is one of the most critical features of these contracts. Furthermore, it boosts the level of trust for the parties when they get into such contracts.\n\nHowever, the same thing cannot be said about the transparency of traditional contracts. Clearly, this is because the level of transparency is questionable. The manner in which the interpretation of these contracts takes place may give rise to questions. Thus, in the case of traditional contracts, there exists a possibility of disputes or disagreements.\n\nWant to know the real-world examples of smart contracts and understand how you can use it for your business? Check out the presentation now on Examples Of Smart Contracts\n\nWhen parties get into contracts, one of the main things that they look for centers around speed. When it comes to smart contracts, the speed of implementing the contracts is high. As they are automated and there is no involvement of intermediaries, the speed is a great strength of smart contracts. Due to the high speed, it is possible to manage time efficiently for parties that engage in these contracts.\n\nThe speed in traditional contracts is significantly low in comparison to smart contracts. One of the main reasons for this is the involvement of intermediaries or third parties. Moreover, the lack of automation limits the speed at which the execution of these contracts takes place. Therefore, the low speed of traditional contracts makes them a time-consuming approach.\n\nA key smart contracts vs traditional contracts differences is related to their immutable nature. While smart contracts are immutable, traditional contracts are not immutable. Due to the immutable nature of smart contracts, the possibility of malicious actors to forge or tamper with the contract is low.\n\nAfter the execution of a smart contract has taken place, it is not possible to make changes to it. It is a unique trait of smart contracts that strengthens its level of security. In the cyber domain, smart contracts are nothing less than a boon, especially for members of the blockchain community.\n\nIn the case of traditional contracts, there exists no immutability. This is due to the fact that it is possible to tamper with such contracts. As these contracts are paper-based, there is a chance that someone may make modifications or changes to them. Thus, such contracts increase the possibility of conflicts between parties.\n\nCost is an important aspect that has to be taken into consideration when parties form contracts. Smart contracts are highly cost-effective. Obviously, the cost-effectiveness is due to the quick execution capability as well as the absence of third parties. However, in the case of traditional contracts, the cost is higher than that of smart contracts.\n\nThe reliance on intermediaries automatically adds to the cost. The manual process increases the time that is taken to create and execute these kinds of contracts. Hence, the high cost of traditional contracts acts as a major shortcoming. Besides, it diminishes the profitability of the parties.\n\nStart learning Smart Contracts and its development tools with world’s first Smart Contracts Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts now!\n\nSmart contracts serve as highly valuable tools in the blockchain arena. The emergence of these contracts has made it possible for individuals to make the most of blockchain technology. On the basis of the core features and strengths of smart contracts, it is safe to say that they have a bright future ahead.\n\nAs the popularity of blockchain is expanding like never before, the future of smart contracts is highly optimistic. Smart contracts are ideal options when there is no need to obtain validation from any third party. In blockchain, smart contracts serve as indispensable tools that make transactions possible. Without smart contracts, it is impossible to imagine blockchain.\n\nBuild your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects.\n\nIt is true that smart contracts are much superior to traditional contracts in diverse aspects. However, it is equally important to take into account the limitations of smart contracts. Just like every coin has two sides, smart contracts have both strengths as well as limitations. In order to understand the actual potential of smart contracts, you need to be aware of their shortcomings. The knowledge is of immense value for every blockchain enthusiast.\n\nOne of the main limitations of smart contracts is that these contracts are pseudonymous, which exist in the blockchain networks. The transactions in blockchain indeed use pseudonyms for parties. Although it may not be entirely anonymous, the parties do not have to share their legal identities.\n\nThis feature increases the risk of becoming the target of a malicious party within the blockchain network. Moreover, in case a disagreement arises between the parties, it is close to impossible to sort out the matter legally. Parties in smart contracts do not get to enjoy the legal protection that is available in traditional contracts.\n\nAnother limitation of smart contracts revolves around the possibility of coding errors. If you do not have top-notch knowledge of blockchain technology, there is a chance that you may make errors while developing smart contracts. Indeed, the complexity of smart contract coding may lead to errors and diminish the integrity of these contracts.\n\nMoreover, the immutable nature of smart contracts makes them inflexible or rigid. In case you want to make any changes to the contract, there is no room to make any changes. To understand smart contracts vs traditional contracts difference comprehensively, you must take into account diverse attributes.\n\nLearn about the fundamentals of smart contracts \u0026 solidity with our free Solidity \u0026 Smart Contracts E-book\n\nBoth smart contracts and traditional contracts exist in the contractual domain. In digital times, the emergence of smart contracts has been a blessing in the online blockchain community. An in-depth comparison has been made between smart and traditional contracts. Before getting into any contract, it is instrumental to know how smart contracts are different from traditional contracts. The insight can help you choose the right kind of contract that meets your exact needs and expectations.\n\nA plethora of differences that exist between smart contracts and traditional contracts have been presented before you. The key differences exist in terms of automation, level of transparency, speed, immutability, and cost. The future of smart contracts seems to be full of promise and potential, as it is ideal in the digital world. It is essential for you to bear in mind the core strengths along with the limitations of smart contracts so that you can make the most of these contracts.\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "Human beings are prone to rely on optimized variables in their daily lives without even realizing it. When you go to your workplace, you choose the\n\n",
    "content": "Human beings are prone to rely on optimized variables in their daily lives without even realizing it. When you go to your workplace, you choose the shorter route to eliminate traffic hassles. Similarly, you might book a cab in advance while going to attend an important meeting. These examples show that humans look for ways to optimize certain things to make our lives easier. Now that you are aware of optimization, the concept of gradient descent will be much easier to comprehend.\n\nIn the context of machine learning, gradient descent refers to an iterative process that is responsible for locating a function’s minima. Do you still have the question – What Is a Gradient Descent ML? The answer is gradient descent is an optimization algorithm. The gradient descent in the machine learning realm is essential as it helps in updating parameters in a model. As gradient descent refers to the cornerstone in the vast arena of machine learning, it is essential to learn about it at an in-depth level.\n\nAt the very core, it is the algorithm that aids in finding optimal parameters, including biases and weights of a neural network. The objective of Gradient Descent in Machine Learning is to decrease a cost function to the maximum extent. It is a common algorithm that has relevance for training machine learning models by diminishing errors between the expected and actual outcomes.\n\nGradient descent acts as the chief tool to optimize learning models. Once you meet the optimization objective, you can use these models as powerful components in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, you can also use these models in diverse other applications. The Gradient Descent ML guide will help you understand gradient descent, its types, and associated challenges.\n\n\n\nBefore diving further into the domain of gradient descent, you need to familiarize yourself with the concept of cost function. A cost function in Gradient Descent Machine Learning context refers to the measurement of error or variance between actual and expected values. The role of a cost function is important since it helps in improving the efficiency of machine learning. The enhancement of efficiency is possible because feedback is available to the model to help keep a tab on errors. In addition to this, the cost function iterates along the path of the negative gradient until it approaches zero value.\n\nGradient descent algorithms are of three types, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. An understanding of each of the types is essential as it can guide you to apply them effectively. The insight into different types of gradient descent algorithms can assist you while working on varying Gradient Descent projects.\n\nThe batch gradient descent is the simplest or most basic variant of gradient descent. It is also known as the vanilla gradient descent. In such a gradient descent, the entire training dataset is used for computing the cost function’s gradient. Moreover, the computation is done with regard to the parameters of the model in every iteration. This Gradient Descent Machine Learning may be computationally costly in the case of large datasets. However, the batch gradient descent can undoubtedly guarantee the convergence to the local minimum relating to the cost function.\n\nIn batch gradient descent, the update of the model takes place only after the evaluation of every training example. An important advantage of batch gradient descent is the high computational efficiency. Without a doubt, the technique has low computational requirements. The lack of need for any updates after every sample contributes to its efficiency. It results in the generation of a stable convergence as well as a stable error gradient.\n\nTake your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence with all the definitions of important AI concepts and terms with simple AI Flashcards.\n\nStochastic gradient descent is another important type of gradient descent that is highly relevant and useful for optimization purposes. The specific variant of gradient descent helps in resolving computational inefficiencies relating to conventional gradient descent mechanisms in large datasets.\n\nA unique attribute of the gradient descent is that instead of utilizing the whole dataset, a random training example is chosen. The computing of the gradient is done using the random training example. Similarly, this random element is used for making updates to the parameters of the machine learning model. The randomization feature allows the generalization of models.\n\nA major benefit of the stochastic gradient descent variant is its high efficiency, even in the case of large datasets. By using a single training example that is randomly chosen, it is possible to curb computational costs for each iteration. This is because, unlike traditional gradient descent methods, the processing of the entire dataset is not compulsory. While comparing stochastic gradient descent with batch gradient descent, the former is able to converge at a faster rate than the latter.\n\nThe mini-batch gradient descent is another variant that fuses the concepts from batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. In this case, the training dataset is split into two different and smaller batches. In each of the batches, specific updates are made. A key highlight of the variant is that it helps to strike a balance between the two gradient descent categories. Due to the unique approach, in this type of machine learning gradient descent, it is possible to bring symmetry between speed as well as computational efficiency.\n\nThe crossover between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent helps to derive the benefits of each of the variants. A chief advantage of mini-batch gradient descent is that it is capable of simultaneously processing varying data points. This dimension relating to parallelism amplifies gradient computation as well as updates in parameters. Hence it results in faster and efficient convergence.\n\nWhile working on diverse Gradient Descent projects, insight into its different variants is essential. A solid understanding in this regard can help you make the optimum use of gradient descent algorithms. Each of the types of gradient descent algorithms has its distinguishing attributes and features. To ensure the optimization of models, you need to expand your comprehension of the different gradient descent variants.\n\nWant to understand the importance of ethics in AI, ethical frameworks, principles, and challenges? Enroll now in Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course\n\nThe gradient descent is able to numerically estimate the point at which the output of a function is at its lowest. The cost function that exists within the gradient descent serves as a vital instrument capable of gauging the accuracy with each iteration. The optimization algorithm is able to iteratively make adjustments to the parameters in the direction of a negative gradient. The fundamental objective of making the adjustments is to find the optimum or ideal set of parameters in a model.\n\nThe gradient descent algorithm works by computing the gradient of the cost function. The gradient of the cost function is indicative of the magnitude as well as the direction of the steepest slope. Since the fundamental purpose of the optimization algorithm is to diminish the cost function, the gradient descent shifts in the opposite direction of the gradient. It is the negative gradient direction. By repeatedly updating the parameters of a model in the negative gradient direction, it is possible to male convergence toward optimum parameters.\n\nThere is a diverse range of areas where gradient descent algorithms are of high relevance and usefulness. Some of the common machine learning algorithms where the optimization algorithms make a valuable contribution are neural networks and logistic regression. Additionally, Gradient Descent ML examples are common in other areas, such as linear regression and support vector machines.\n\nExcited to learn the fundamentals of AI applications in business? Enroll now in the AI For Business Course\n\nIt is a fact that the gradient descent algorithm acts as a robust algorithm that boosts optimization. However, it is essential to take into account the challenges and concerns that arise while using the gradient descent algorithm. In order to get a comprehensive insight into Gradient Descent In Machine Learning, you must be aware of the challenges.\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges that arises in the context of gradient descent revolves around overfitting. There is a possibility that the optimization algorithm may overfit the training dataset. This possibility mainly arises in case the learning rate is excessively high or the model is overly complex in nature. In case such a challenge arises in Gradient Descent Machine Learning, it may result in inefficient generalization performance.\n\nWant to develop the skill in ChatGPT to familiarize yourself with the AI language model? Enroll now in ChatGPT Fundamentals Course\n\nA serious challenge that may arise while using gradient descent is the possibility of converging to local optima. In case there exist multiple valleys and peaks in the cost function, there is a chance for the algorithm to converge to local optima instead of the global optima.\n\nThe role of the learning rate is of paramount importance while using a gradient descent algorithm in the machine learning realm. The selection of the learning rate may impact the overall performance of the optimization algorithm. In case the learning rate is extremely high, there is a probability that the gradient descent may overshoot the minimum. Similarly, if the learning rate is excessively low, there is a possibility that the gradient descent may take a long time to converge. Either way, the optimization function will have an impact in the end.\n\nThe rate of convergence of the gradient descent algorithm may become slow in the case of large datasets. Similarly, the convergence rate may also be slow in case there exists high-dimensional spaces. Regardless of the exact reason for the high convergence rate, the optimization algorithm will become expensive for computation purposes.\n\nIn the deep learning realm, saddle point refers to the spot where a function’s gradients may entirely vanish. The surprising thing is that this may happen in a location that is neither a local minimum nor a global minimum. When it comes to high-dimensional spaces, there is a chance that gradients relating to cost functions may have saddle points. It may ultimately result in the ineffectiveness of the gradient descent algorithm. There is a probability that the optimization algorithm may remain in an upland, and convergence may not be possible.\n\nThere are several challenges relating to gradient descent that you need to know. You need to update your knowledge about such challenges and concern areas so that appropriate measures can be taken. If you are feeling overwhelmed after learning about the challenges, there is no need to worry. The good news is that numerous variations of gradient descent have emerged in recent years.\n\nThe purpose of the new variations of gradient descent algorithm is to help overcome obstacles and challenges. Some of the common types of gradient descent variations are momentum-based methods, second-order methods, and adaptive learning rate methods. You need to broaden your knowledge and understanding of each of these variations. By having a solid insight into these areas, you will be able to work on a diverse range of Gradient Descent projects efficiently.\n\nExplore the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with our Generative AI Skill Path.\n\nGradient Descent In Machine Learning can be seen as a barometer that measures the accuracy of a model. The measurement for every iteration is undertaken until the function is close to zero. You cannot think of machine learning without taking into account the gradient descent algorithm. In machine learning, gradient descent plays an indispensable role by optimizing the degree of accuracy of a model. As a result, machine learning models can serve as powerful instruments that have the capability to recognize or predict certain kinds of patterns.\n\nThe insight into the gradient descent algorithm is crucial to solidify your foundation on machine learning. An understanding of different types of gradient descent algorithms can help in applying the right variant to meet your exact needs. The high relevance of the algorithm to optimize models has led to its immense popularity. By referring to the Gradient Descent ML guide, you can identify diverse areas where these algorithms have made a presence.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Smart contracts are the primary components of the blockchain landscape. However, most of the smart contract development projects focus on the Ethereum blockchain only. While Ethereum delivers promising functionalities for creating smart contracts, it has been experiencing problems with scalability and cost.\n\nTherefore, smart contract development on Solana blockchain has emerged as a trusted alternative. Why? Solana is a popular choice for blockchain developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. It arrived in 2017 and offered a promising solution for the scalability issues in existing blockchain networks. Interestingly, Solana has become the top favorite for developers, with the capability to process over 50,000 transactions per second.\n\nSolana blockchain has been designed with an architecture that can help in creating dApps that could manage a large volume of transactions. The popularity of Solana smart contract development has soared higher in recent times, and the Solana ecosystem includes different projects including DeFi solutions and NFTs. It is the first blockchain to offer Proof of History consensus that helps it achieve high speed and scalability. Let us learn more about the architecture of Solana and why it is an effective choice for developing smart contracts.\n\nUnderstand the complete smart contract development lifecycle and development tools with this Smart Contracts Development Course.\n\nThe first thing you need to learn before you find how to deploy smart contract using Solana is the fundamentals of Solana. It is a high-performance blockchain platform that supports dApp development and trading crypto exchanges. The meaning of ‘high performance’ with respect to Solana blockchain is the ability to resolve scalability and congestion issues. Solana utilizes a specialized consensus mechanism, Proof of History consensus, which helps in achieving faster block confirmation times with better efficiency. Proof of History consensus has made Solana one of the fastest blockchain platforms.\n\nThe review of Solana smart contract example would help you understand how it has emerged as the most efficient blockchain network in the world. Proof of History helps in using historical evidence for creating records that could verify that certain events happened at a particular instance in time. The unique consensus mechanism uses a high-frequency verifiable delay function for verifying events.\n\nUpon processing a transaction or event, it has a unique hash and calculation that could be universally verified. The calculation works as a cryptographic timestamp that can help in determining the time when a specific event or transaction happens. Every node on Solana features a cryptographic clock, which helps in tracking the time of the network and sequence of events. As a result, nodes can offer better throughout and efficiency on Solana blockchain.\n\n\n\nThe next important highlight you must learn before developing smart contracts on Solana blockchain is the architecture of Solana smart contracts. Solana features an alternative to smart contracts with programs. Solana follows two distinct workflows for development of smart contracts and dApps. In addition, the answers to “What language is used in Solana smart contract development?” also point to simple alternatives, such as C, C++, and Rust. Solana programs or smart contracts can be deployed on the chain and operate with the ‘Solana Runtime’ feature.\n\nSolana follows a completely distinct smart contract model as compared to traditional EVM-based blockchains. The code and the state of the smart contract code are combined in one contract in conventional blockchains. On the contrary, Solana smart contract development involves stateless smart contracts, which include the program logic only. External accounts can interact with the smart contracts deployed on Solana blockchain for storing data associated with program interaction.\n\nThis way, you can ensure logical isolation of contract code from state, which serves as a major advantage for smart contract development with Solana. Furthermore, Solana also offers the options of Command Line Interface and JSON RPC API for facilitating interactions with dApps. Decentralized apps could also interact with Solana programs and the blockchain by utilizing existing SDKs.\n\nExcited to learn about the fundamentals of Solana and Solana smart contracts development, Enroll now in the Solana Development Course.\n\nThe comprehensive review of a Solana smart contract example would help you understand the workflow of a smart contract architecture on Solana. The Solana Program is the section that helps in creating smart contracts with C, C++, and Rust and deploying them on Solana blockchain. In the second step, users would have to develop decentralized apps with the support of client SDKs alongside JSON RPC API for using Solana programs.\n\nOn top of it, the ‘Client’ section in Solana smart contracts focuses on creating decentralized apps for interacting with programs deployed on Solana blockchain. Decentralized apps could interact with different deployed programs to ensure transaction submission through client SDK. The ‘Program’ and the ‘Client’ sections of the smart contract work in collaboration with each other to develop an ecosystem of dApps and smart contracts for updating the state of the Solana blockchain.\n\nLearn about the critical vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contract development with our Smart Contracts Security Course\n\nThe benefits of Solana programs ensure that they are important alternatives to the traditional smart contracts on other blockchains. Solana is one of the biggest competitors to Ethereum even with the similarities with other blockchains. The primary reason to deploy smart contract using Solana is the benefit of cost-effective smart contract development.\n\nEthereum developers have been experiencing problems due to extremely high transaction fees, which can rise exorbitantly during network congestion. Solana offers better throughput than Ethereum as it can manage more transactions per second, thereby reducing costs.\n\nThe faster transaction speeds could ensure that Solana can compete against popular centralized payment processors. Solana programs can play a vital role in improving the speed and scalability of crypto networks alongside making them more accessible. With a crypto wallet that holds SOL tokens and Solana-based tokens, you can leverage the facilities of interacting with different apps available on Solana ecosystem.\n\nUsers can also exchange a token for another on a decentralized exchange of their choice or purchase NFT from a marketplace in the Solana ecosystem. Irrespective of the type of transaction you do on Solana, you would have to pay a smaller fee than the one you have to pay on Ethereum.\n\nAre you aspiring to learn the fundamentals of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and smart contracts’ upgradability?

    "content": "Shiba Inu, known as the “Dogecoin Killer,” is eagerly anticipating a significant price leap. Market analyst Ashish has sparked excitement with a bold prediction: a 600% surge that could catapult the meme coin to an impressive $0.000075.\n\nThis bullish forecast comes after what Ashish describes as a nearly two-year-long slumber within a consolidation pattern. December 2023 saw Shiba Inu finally break free from this price purgatory, breaching a crucial resistance trendline. The breakout ignited a rally that culminated in a 370% surge, reaching a 2024 high of $0.000045 in early March.\n\nHowever, the party wasn’t meant to last. A correction ensued, prompting Ashish to establish strategic buying zones between $0.000022 and $0.000025.\n\n\n\nAshish’s crystal ball sees a bullish flag pattern emerging on the 1-hour chart, hinting at a potential “second leg up.” This technical indicator suggests a period of consolidation following a sharp price increase, often acting as a precursor to another upward movement.\n\nDespite a slight price dip today, Shiba Inu appears to have room for growth. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at nearly 48, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral territory suggests potential for upward movement, aligning with Ashish’s prediction of a second leg up.\n\nMeanwhile, CoinCodex’s current Shiba Inu price prediction forecasts a rise of 220%, potentially reaching $0.00008089 by June 24, 2024. CoinCodex’s technical indicators currently show a Neutral sentiment, while the Fear \u0026 Greed Index stands at 76, indicating Extreme Greed. Over the past 30 days, Shiba Inu has seen 12 out of 30 green days (40%) with a price volatility of 4.40%.\n\nGiven these metrics, it’s clear that Shiba Inu’s market behavior is capturing significant investor interest. The Extreme Greed reading on the Fear \u0026 Greed Index suggests a high level of enthusiasm, which, while positive for potential price gains, also warrants caution due to the possibility of rapid sentiment shifts.\n\nThe coin’s moderate volatility and the occurrence of green days indicate a steady, albeit unpredictable, upward momentum. This combination of factors makes Shiba Inu a fascinating asset to watch in the coming months.\n\nAs of today, the overall sentiment for the Shiba Inu price prediction is neutral. This assessment is supported by technical analysis indicators, where 20 indicators are showing bullish signals, while eight are signaling bearish trends.\n\nThis balanced sentiment reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. The fact that a significant number of indicators are bullish suggests there is optimism about Shiba Inu’s short-term potential, possibly driven by recent market activities or positive news.\n\nFeatured image from Top Gear, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally.\n\nThe VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices.\n\nNormally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead.\n\nThe VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero.\n\nEarlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset.\n\nAs is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead.\n\nIn the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then.\n\nSince then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run.\n\nBased on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.”\n\nAs for how things could play out next, the analyst says,\n\nConsolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates.\n\nWoo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture.\n\nBTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst.\n\nBitcoin had recovered above $71,000 earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then, as it’s now back below $70,000.\n\n",

    "content": "Over some days, the price of Ethereum has been in a consolidation zone, moving between $3,949 and $3,627. This is a result of the rally that happened a few days ago which led to the crypto asset’s price making over 10% movement on the upside.\n\nWhen prices are consolidating, it can only be considered that it is building momentum to either break above the consolidation zone or below it. At this point, we cannot tell the next action the price will take.\n\nIn this article, we will see the possible outcome if there is a break out from the consolidation. As of the time of writing, the price of ETH was up by 0.66%, trading around $3,752 above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the last 24 hours.\n\nLooking at Ethereum’s chart on the 4-hour timeframe, it can observed that the price is trading above the 100-day moving average, suggesting ETH’s price is on a bullish trend and could break above the consolidation zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, with the help of the MACD indicator, although the MACD histograms are trending below the MACD zero line, these are already showing signs of weakness as the histogram color is becoming faint.\n\nThe MACD line and the MACD signal line are also seen moving toward the MACD zero line but as long as they are still above the zero line, there could be a possible reverser.\n\nWith this MACD formation, it could be suggested that the price of Ethereum is still bullish and there is a possibility it could break above the consolidation zone\n\nFinally, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also to analyze the price action in the 4-hour timeframe, it can be seen that the RSI line is attempting to back up after failing to cross below the 50 lines, suggesting that the price is still bullish.\n\n\n\nConclusively, if there is a break out above the consolidation zone, the price of ETH might continue to move upward toward the $4,094 resistance level. Should the price surpass this resistance level, it might move further upward to create a new high for the year.\n\nOn the contrary, if Ethereum breaks below the consolidation zone, the price might begin to move toward the $3,263 support level. A breakout below this level might cause a continuous downward movement toward the $2,864.04 support level.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Data of a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator could suggest $77,600 may be the level where the asset could see its next top.\n\n",
    "content": "Data from a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator suggests that $77,600 may be the level where the asset will see its next peak.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed what the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands model could suggest about the cryptocurrency’s future.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a popular on-chain indicator that compares the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The former is just the total valuation of the asset at the current spot price, while the latter is a model that calculates the asset’s cap by assuming the “true” value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain.\n\nThe previous transfer of any coin on the network was likely the last time it changed hands, and thus, the price at that time would be its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap keeps track of the sum of the cost basis of every investor in the market.\n\nTherefore, the MVRV ratio tells us how the value the investors hold (the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap).\n\nBased on this indicator, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has developed a pricing bands model. Below is a chart showing what these pricing bands look like.\n\nThe pricing bands in this model represent levels corresponding to a specific deviation from the mean for the MVRV ratio. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency is currently above the price level, corresponding to a +0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the mean for the indicator.\n\nMore specifically, the price level around $65,100 would be where the MVRV ratio would be +0.5 SD above its mean. The next major pricing band in this model is +1 SD, which currently corresponds to around $77,600.\n\nIn the past, this level has been where at least local tops have been probable to form for BTC. As is visible in the graph, the rally top back in March also occurred when BTC broke this level.\n\n“Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC top before a brief correction could be around $77,593!” notes the analyst.\n\nFrom the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, a potential rally to a new all-time high of $77,593 would mean an increase of more than 11% for the asset. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop from here and whether it will be able to maintain above the +0.5 SD MVRV level.\n\nSince its sharp surge earlier, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to have cooled off as the asset has fallen to sideways movement around the $69,700 mark.\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market.\n\nNaturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years:\n\n\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH).\n\nThis would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run.\n\nWith the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark.\n\nIt would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin.\n\n\n\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise.\n\nThis is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH.\n\nBitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Two of the industry stalwarts, Fantom and Avalanche, have seen their values soar in recent weeks as altcoins season gets underway. Those who missed the opportunity are searching far and wide for their next chance, and many have come upon Raboo.\n\nRaboo is a brand-new cryptocurrency initial coin offering, currently in its presale phase. It has recently surpassed $1.4 million in sales, revealing its potential to change the meme coin culture tenfold. Analysts predict a 233% return for Raboo holders. Read on to find out why.\n\nIn recent weeks, Fantom (FTM) has become the talk of the cryptocurrency world thanks to its optimistic market increases. Fantom, known for its speed and scalability, has experienced a price surge. It increased from a low of $0.32 in mid-January and increased to $1.13 on March 23rd. However, it was unable to sustain that height and is now trading at $0.80.\n\nAnalysts claim that Fantom price rise isn’t the product of chance alone, but rather a result of strong whale activity and an increase in network interaction. They now have a strong interest in Fantom and have set a price objective for this year of about $1.60. There is a chance that the $1 resistance level could be retested soon.\n\nHowever, holders of the coin are not confident that Fantom price will stay bullish and have now looked to Raboo as a safe haven.\n\nJust like Fanto (FTM), Avalanche (AVAX) has surged in an optimistic environment. Avalanche’s AVAX token, which is well-known for its incredibly quick transaction times and extensive ecosystem, has been seeing notable weekly increases. Avalanche gave investors almost 100% returns in a matter of months, rising from $29.48 in January to and peaked at $60.69 by March.\n\nAvalanche price is now trading at $37.74 and has remained bullish for the past week. AVAX may reach or perhaps surpass $50 in the upcoming weeks if it maintains its bullish trend and breaks through the $45 resistance level. Sustained market interest and advantageous trade conditions are prerequisites for this scenario.\n\nRaboo the lighthearted yet powerful realm of meme coins, Raboo ($RABT) is swiftly rising to prominence as a cryptocurrency. What’s the buzz about? Raboo is a meme coin that combines humor and real financial potential.\n\nRaboo has already crushed the $1.4 Million funding milestone in Stage 3 of its presale, demonstrating the trust of the market and great investor demand. This accomplishment is proof of Raboo’s attractiveness and promise, not just a figure. Join the thriving community by buying the presale token for $0.0042. Purchasing an investment in Raboo entails joining a thriving community that is at the forefront of fusing income with fun.\n\nWith a total supply of 1.8 billion, analysts project a startling 100x increase on launch day and a 233% boost in the presale. This cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) has the potential to be the largest AI-powered meme coin of 2024, taking a sizable portion of the $62 billion meme coin market.\n\nFantom and Avalanche are both top coins in the crypto market, generating profit for their holders. While both Fantom and Avalanche are currently on a bullish trend, whether they will sustain the position is still in question. This has led them to seek safe haven in Raboo, the newest project in the market. Although it is yet to launch, Raboo is showing signs of potentially huge profits.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here.\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin spot ETF market continued its resurgence on one side, marked by a second consecutive week of positive inflows.\n\n",
    "content": "Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) have been the talk of the town – and rightly so – after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of the investment products during the week. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin spot ETF market continued its resurgence on one side, marked by a second consecutive week of positive inflows.\n\nThis streak of positive inflows represents a complete shift from previous weeks when investment activity was dangerously low. However, this recent turnaround reflects a rise in investor confidence over the past two weeks.\n\nOn Friday, May 24, the US Bitcoin spot ETF market saw another day of positive inflows, marking the 10th consecutive day of significant investment into these funds. According to data from SoSoValue, the market recorded a total net inflow of approximately $252 million to close the week.\n\nBreaking this down, BlackRock amassed a substantial percentage of the total daily investment, with the IBIT ETF posting an inflow of $182 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), on the other hand, did not attract any capital on Friday, ending the week with zero daily outflows and inflow.\n\nOther ETF issuers, such as Fidelity, Bitwise, and ARK Investment, also witnessed impressive inflows on Friday. Most notably, Fidelity’s FBTC came second to BlackRock’s fund after attracting about $43.7 million on the last day of the week.\n\nMore importantly, this positive inflow day means that the Bitcoin spot ETF market has amassed significant investment every day for the second week in a row. And after the close of Friday’s trading session, the net inflow in the past week stood at an impressive $1.06 billion.\n\nThis sustained positive trend in terms of capital inflow suggests that investor confidence in Bitcoin ETFs might be back at an all-time high. The last time there was a consistent positive capital inflow into these products, the Bitcoin price rose to a new all-time high.\n\nWith Ethereum spot ETFs on the brink of trading in the US, crypto exchange-trade products seem to be in fashion at the moment. And they might just be the catalyst that the crypto market – particularly Bitcoin – needs to resume what is left of the bull cycle.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $68,868, reflecting a 2.5% price increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by 3% on the weekly timeframe.\n\n",

    "content": "In a week marked by consolidation across the cryptocurrency market, the native token of Uniswap, UNI, has defied the trend, surging over 15%, and surpassing the $10 mark. This bullish run comes amid positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and Uniswap’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBeyond the legal battle, the current momentum within the Ethereum ecosystem is also propelling UNI’s price upwards. On-chain data reveals significant whale withdrawals from crypto exchanges following news of a potential spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAnother fresh wallet withdrew 213,166 UNI($1.96M) from #Binance just now.https://t.co/u15CE864hm pic.twitter.com/kyOBv0TB5G\n\n— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 24, 2024\n\nThis flight to safety, coupled with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, is creating a ripple effect that benefits UNI, a key player within the Ethereum DeFi landscape.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, UNI’s breakout from a monthly consolidation phase paints a promising picture. Both technical indicators and on-chain data suggest a potential 25% price increase for UNI.\n\nThe token’s recent surge indicates a potential bull run, with analysts eyeing a price target of $12.80 if the current momentum continues.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire is Santiment’s Age Consumed index, which measures the movement of dormant tokens. Spikes in this index often precede price rallies, and the latest uptick by the latter part of April seems to have foreshadowed UNI’s current uptrend.\n\nThis on-chain metric reinforces the bullish outlook for UNI, suggesting that investors are awakening to its potential.\n\nThe recent price rally has also been accompanied by a significant rise in trading activity. Data from Coinalyze reveals over $1 million in Uniswap liquidations in the last day.\n\nThe majority of these liquidations (over $750,000) were short positions, indicating that traders betting against UNI are feeling the heat. This surge in open interest, with more traders going long on UNI, further strengthens the bullish control over the token’s price.\n\nThis display of defiance has instilled confidence among investors, who view it as a positive sign for Uniswap’s future. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) recently received a Wells notice from the regulatory body, alleging that UNI is a security. However, Uniswap has vowed to challenge this claim, asserting that the SEC’s case is weak.\n\nThe SEC case against Uniswap remains unresolved, and a negative outcome could dampen investor sentiment. A broader market correction could still impact UNI’s price.\n\nFeatured image from Wallpapers, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors. However, crypto analyst Jelle has suggested that there is no need to be worried about the flagship crypto’s price action.\n\nJelle noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still following a “similar path” to the 2017 bull run. He claimed that once the crypto token breaks again above the 2021 all-time high ($69,000), it will make a parabolic move to the upside. Jelle predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 when that happens.\n\nIn an earlier X post, Jelle provided insights into why Bitcoin could easily make such a move. He revealed that all key resistance levels have been broken. He also noted that a weekly hidden bullish divergence had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, just on top of the previous cycle highs.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Mags also echoed Jelle’s bullish sentiment. In an X post, he mentioned that this recent price correction was the “fakeout before the next leg up.” Mags noted how Bitcoin has maintained a similar pattern since its price bottomed at $15,000, with the flagship crypto consolidating inside a range for “a few weeks or months.”\n\nMags claims that Bitcoin then breaks below the range where it traps all bears before making a “quick reclaim and another leg up.” The analyst added that there is going to be a “massive leg up soon” if Bitcoin manages to repeat this pattern.\n\nCrypto analyst BitQuant also assured there was no need to panic about Bitcoin’s recent dip. In an X post, he claimed that the price dip was a “good confirmation” that Bitcoin is preparing for a “big leg up.” The crypto analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $95,000 when this parabolic move happens.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin’s outlook is bullish regardless of what happens. He outlined two possible moves the flagship crypto could make from here. First, he stated that a weekly candle close above $71,500 would likely kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range.\n\nOn the other hand, he noted that history suggests that Bitcoin will consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for some weeks more. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still bound to make significant moves to the upside, and all that matters is the timing. The analyst noted that a breakout now could mean Bitcoin would have an accelerated cycle.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for some more weeks, that will help it resynchronize with past halving cycles, resulting in a longer bull run.\n\n",

    "summary": "An analyst has explained how the Bitcoin available for trading has quietly been going down during the asset\u0027s recent phase of consolidation.\n\n",
    "content": "An analyst explained how Bitcoin’s availability for trading has quietly declined during the asset’s recent consolidation phase.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discusses the recent trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms.\n\nThe chart below shows how the spot and paper BTC reserves have changed over the past few years.\n\nAs the graph shows, the Bitcoin sitting in spot wallets has been declining over the last couple of months. The total amount of such BTC in the custody of central entities has now dropped to just 2.3 million.\n\nIt’s also apparent that the total sum of the spot and “paper” BTC (highlighted in purple) has declined at the same time. Paper BTC here refers to derivatives products related to cryptocurrency that don’t actually require investors to own the asset.\n\nThus, given that the combined sum of the exchange inventory has gone down for the cryptocurrency, it would appear that the decrease in the spot BTC isn’t because paper BTC has replaced it.\n\nGenerally, the supply of exchanges is considered part of the Bitcoin supply, which is “available” for trading. As such, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, less of this available supply may be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFrom the graph, it’s visible that this decline in the exchange inventory has come during a period where the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled after setting a new all-time high (ATH). As Woo notes,\n\nWhile everyone was freaking out that Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place.\n\nThus, the fact that the available supply has gone down during such a period could be a bullish sign for the coin. “It’s only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time highs,” says the analyst.\n\nIn another X post, Woo also discussed how capital inflows into Bitcoin have just started to pick up again after registering a steep drop earlier.\n\nAs the chart shows, network inflows spiked alongside the all-time high, but they observed a major slowdown in the consolidation that followed.\n\nThe inflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighted in light green, also disappeared earlier, but they have now made a comeback alongside these fresh capital inflows.\n\nBitcoin had recovered as high as $71,000 earlier but appears to have slipped off over the last few days as it has now returned below the $68,000 level.\n\n",

    "content": "CORE, the native token of the layer-1 network CoreChain, has surged over 20% in the last 24 hours. This is a notable price increase, considering the downward trend in the broader crypto market with the prices of other major cap tokens, including Ethereum (ETH) dumping.\n\nCORE’s price rallied by over 20% following crypto exchange Coinbase’s decision to add the crypto token to its listing ‘Roadmap.’ That means the foremost US crypto exchange plans to list CORE at some point, although it hasn’t disclosed exactly when that will happen. Regardless, this is undoubtedly a positive development for the CORE ecosystem, given the exposure and mass adoption it could gain from being listed on Coinbase.\n\nCORE runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-1 blockchain CoreChain. The network is unique because it adopts a ‘Satoshi Plus’ consensus mechanism. This mechanism adopts Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) and Ethereum’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism to address the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security.\n\nCORE has already had quite a year, considering it is one of the best-performing crypto assets among the top 100 coins by market cap, with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 265%. This feat is more commendable given that only three crypto tokens (Dogwifhat, PEPE, and Arweave) in the top 50 rankings have made more YTD gains than CORE.\n\nInterestingly, most of CORE’s price gains came in the weeks leading up to the Bitcoin halving, with the crypto’s price skyrocketing by over 220% in a single week. CORE’s interoperability with Bitcoin also gives it an edge, with the network launching ‘CoreBTC,’ which allows users to bridge their BTC tokens to the network, thereby tapping into the liquidity on the flagship network, Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase’s decision to add CORE to its list listing roadmap follows its recent listing of XRP and BONK for its New York customers. The crypto exchange’s decision to relist XRP undoubtedly raised eyebrows, considering it had delisted the crypto token in 2021, shortly after the legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple began.\n\nMeanwhile, BONK’s listing has caused many in the crypto community to question when the crypto exchange will also list meme coins, Dogwifhat, and PEPE. Coinbase’s hesitation to list these two meme coins continues to be a surprise, given that they are the fourth and third largest meme coins by market cap, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase International Exchange also recently announced that it will add support for Bonk, FLOKI, and Shiba Inu perpetual futures on its platform and Coinbase Advanced. The platform added that trading will officially begin on May 30th. Coinbase Derivatives also recently launched futures contracts for the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin.\n\nFeatured image from NBC News, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum appear to currently be the center of attention in the crypto market so far, with Bitcoin recently hitting just above a 24-hour high of $71,650 mark, marking a 6.4% increase in the past 24 hours and nearly 20% over the past week.\n\nA prominent Crypto Analyst who has since been tracking Bitcoin’s movements has recently revealed insights into the asset’s latest trends, signaling a notable move ahead for BTC.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current “Re-Accumulation Range.”\n\nHowever, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory.\n\n#BTC\n\nA Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range\n\nHowever, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more\n\nExtended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to… pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024\n\nThis extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency “resynchronize” with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted:\n\nAfter all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs)\n\nThe analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range.\n\nMeanwhile, another analyst, TechDev, recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential future trajectory, drawing parallels between the current market actions and those of the 2017 bull run.\n\nBack then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017.\n\nSupporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path.\n\n#BTC\n\nEven $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024\n\nNotably, the surge in Bitcoin’s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nData from Farside indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced their most substantial inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively achieving $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17.\n\nNotably, about 89% of these inflows occurred in the last three trading days of the week, following a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

The most recent dip toward $60,000 saw these large investors gobble up BTC at an alarming rate, with their daily spending coming in at billions of dollars.\n\nIn a stunning discovery, co-founder of Bitcoin-based company Apollo, Thomas Fahrer, revealed that Bitcoin whales have been rapidly buying up the tokens amid price drawdown. More specifically, the daily spend of these whales caught Fahrer’s eye.\n\nThe report shared by the founder shows that while smaller investors had been selling, Bitcoin whales were buying up billions of dollars worth of coins. In the 24-hour period, these whales holding more than 1,000 BTC on their balances accumulated 8,953 BTC, worth $6.3 billion at the time.

Who’s selling? pic.twitter.com/3dLD2BI89L\n\n— Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) May 22, 2024\n\nThis accumulation trend comes in light of smaller investors selling their tokens. For example, Fahrer’s screenshot show Sharks, which are investors holding between 100-1,000 BTC on their balances sold 6,746 BTC in one day, worth around $5 billion.\n\nOther notable sellers include the crabs, which are investors holding 1-10 BTC, selling 1,074 BTC in the same time period. Shrimps – investors holding 0-1 BTC, were also caught selling, with a total of 591 BTC sold. While Fish investors, those holding 10-100 BTC, sold only 95 BTC in the one day period.\n\nThe flow of these investors shows that BTC is flowing out from smaller investors toward larger investors, something that is bullish for the price. The same is the case on the weekly timeframe where Shrimps sold 2,079 BTC, Crabs sold 5,748 BTC, Fish sold 1,155 BTC, while Sharks bought up 60 BTC, with Bitcoin whales buying the majority with 12,085 BTC.\n\nA number of crypto analysts have called for buying and it seems Bitcoin whales are the ones following this advice. One of the analysts who has been vocal about it being the time to buy is Ali Martinez, who shared an interesting formation on the Bitcoin chart.\n\nMartinez pointed out that the TD Sequential, which had previously predicted the Bitcoin price movement, had flashed a buy signal. The level at which this analyst presented this buy signal was around the $69,500 level, and since then, the BTC price has since rebounded above $70,000, suggesting the buy signal was correct.\n\nThe TD Sequential has accurately predicted #Bitcoin price action on the one-hour chart. Now, it presents a buy signal, anticipating $BTC will rebound! pic.twitter.com/6ImRkREPVW\n\n— Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024\n\nIf the TD Sequential holds like it did the last time it appeared, then the current price push could see Bitcoin reach a new all-time high above $74,000, since the last one saw an almost 15% move. But for now, Bitcoin bulls are fighting to maintain its position above $70,000, with a 12.22% increase in the last week.\n\n",

    "content": "Solana (SOL) defied a slight market dip today, maintaining key support levels and sparking renewed optimism among investors. The altcoin boasts a healthy 24-hour trading volume of $6.50 billion, solidifying its position among the top cryptocurrencies. Market dominance for SOL sits at 3.04%.\n\nProminent crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade isn’t shying away from bold predictions. In a recent analysis, Tardigrade expressed a highly optimistic view of Solana’s future price trajectory. According to the analyst, SOL, currently trading at $170, has successfully broken free from its recent consolidation pattern, signifying a bullish charge towards a staggering $1,000 mark.\n\nMacro structure $SOL 🔥#Solana has broken out the 2nd triangle from the recent bottom and is heading to $1000 🚀 Have you heard about #socialfi on #Solana? Interesting that you can now share images to your friends through blockchain with private messages (wallet👛 to wallet👛)… pic.twitter.com/yoSnLK9dSs\n\n— Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 23, 2024\n\nBeyond price predictions, Tardigrade emphasized the exciting developments brewing within the Solana ecosystem. One such development is the rise of SocialFi applications, a new wave of social media platforms built on blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nWhile short-term price fluctuations saw a 4.50% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 1.30% decline over the past week, the overall outlook for SOL remains upbeat. Market observers are particularly enthusiastic about both the immediate and long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe recent green light for the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF is expected to have a ripple effect, positively impacting the entire altcoin market, including Solana. This market-wide bullish sentiment could propel SOL prices even higher.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF’s approval not only signifies increased institutional trust in the cryptocurrency market but also paves the way for other blockchain projects to gain mainstream attention. As more investors become comfortable with cryptocurrency investments through regulated financial products, altcoins like Solana are poised to benefit from increased liquidity and wider adoption.\n\nAt its all-time high of $259 on November 6, 2021, Solana reached its highest price; at its all-time low of $ 0.503701 on May 11, 2020, it recorded its lowest price.\n\nSince its ATH, the lowest price was $8.00. Since the previous cycle low, the highest SOL price was $207. Right now, there is optimistic emotion with the Solana price projection, and the Fear \u0026 Greed Index is showing 76 (Extreme Greed).\n\nFeatured image from Space.com, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin price has cooled off after surging to as high as $71,000 on the back of the Ethereum ETF approval news last week.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price has cooled off after surging to as high as $71,000 on the back of the Ethereum ETF approval news last week. Not long after the price spike, the premier cryptocurrency witnessed a correction to $67,000 and appears to be back in a consolidation range.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin whales seem to be awakening from their slumber, as they have been loading their bags with significant BTC amounts in the past few days. This begs the question – can the returning whales’ appetite push Bitcoin to a new record-high price?\n\nA pseudonymous analyst shared in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post that Bitcoin whales are showing an increased buying appetite and getting active in the market once again. The relevant indicators here are the total whale holdings and a moving average tracking a 30-day percentage change in the balance.\n\nWhales are entities (individuals or organizations) that own substantial amounts of a cryptocurrency (typically at least 1,000 BTC, in this case). Due to the size of their holdings, whales are often able to influence price movements and market dynamics through their activities.\n\nIn the Quicktake post, the on-chain analyst noted a recent increase in the monthly percentage change in whale address holdings and a steady rise in the total whale balance. The pseundonymous pundit said:\n\nThe whales’ appetite for buying Bitcoin has returned strongly, after a two-month decline in buying interest since March.\n\nFrom the chart above, it was observed that the Bitcoin whales had increased their holdings by more than 11% in March when the BTC price hit a new all-time high of $73,737. However, the BTC accumulation rate steadied in April, with the 30-day percentage change falling to around 3% by the end of the month.\n\nBitcoin accumulation appears to be on the rise in May, with the monthly percentage change returning to above 5% as of May 24. The CryptoQuant analyst said in the post:\n\nThey [whales] are now returning with a strong buying force again, indicating that the current prices are suitable for purchasing and accumulating despite the widespread fear.\n\nIf the whale accumulation of BTC returns to its March level, there is an increased likelihood of the Bitcoin price returning to and perhaps surpassing its current all-time high. This projection is even more plausible considering that the premier cryptocurrency did forge a new high the last time the whales accumulated BTC at that rate.\n\nAs of press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $69,216, reflecting a bare 0.8% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly.\n\nThis prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets.\n\nThe firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers.\n\nIn a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.”\n\nSubstantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs.\n\nThe optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence.\n\nFidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow.\n\nYesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi\n\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024\n\nFurther underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC.\n\nOther hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nQCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook.\n\nThe positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation.\n\nThis is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields.\n\nJames Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements.\n\nAccording to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system.\n\nHe noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.”\n\nCoutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

This could potentially lead to a correction over the next one to four candlesticks, particularly noticeable on the four-hour chart.\n\nThe TD Sequential presents a sell signal on the #Bitcoin 4-hour chart, anticipating a one to four candlesticks correction for $BTC. pic.twitter.com/OC9Clv0Tat\n\n— Ali (@ali_charts) May 16, 2024\n\nContrasting this perspective, another prominent analyst, Rekt Capital, recently provided a more optimistic view. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin ended its downtrend in mid-April, breaking into an uptrend with its price surpassing previous resistance levels.\n\nThis change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors.\n\nThe TD Sequential indicator’s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592.\n\nRekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum. He remarked that the recent breakout to $66,000 is a testament to how quickly market sentiment can shift toward a bullish trend.\n\nThe analyst disclosed:\n\nThe Bitcoin Bull Market is not over. But time and time again, the market will try to shake you out of your positions before you are able to profit significantly from them.\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital commented on the broader market trends, noting that the crypto sector is at a critical juncture where narratives are evolving, and the market landscape could change rapidly, especially with impending regulatory developments in the US.\n\nMike Novogratz further expanded on the macro view, suggesting that the next few months could be pivotal for the crypto market as it responds to new narratives and regulatory developments.\n\nIt’s been a fascinating week in crypto. Narratives are forming and odds are shifting. It’ll be interesting to watch the next few months play out, and even more interesting to watch the jump shift that’ll occur as soon as there’s regulatory clarity around crypto in the U.S.… pic.twitter.com/t0g5rTIKjP\n\n— Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) May 16, 2024\n\nHe also recently predicted that Bitcoin’s price will oscillate between $55,000 and $75,000 for some time, indicating a phase of consolidation before any major moves.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns.\n\n",
    "content": "A crypto analyst has forecasted an “ultra bull scenario” for Bitcoin, highlighting key support levels and technical patterns that suggest a price rally above $80,000 in this market cycle.\n\nIn a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CrediBullCrypto’ has doubled down on his previous prediction of an ultra-bull scenario for Bitcoin in the future. The analyst’s insights on Bitcoin’s recent activities suggest that the downside risk may be less significant than previously anticipated, paving a bullish path for a massive upside for Bitcoin.\n\nSharing a graphical chart of Bitcoin’s price actions from April to May 2024 in a YouTube video, Credibull Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rising above $100,000 in this projected ultra-bull scenario. The focal point of his analysis was based on the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAccording to the crypto analyst, Open Interest has reached 78,000 BTC, significantly higher than its baseline of 64,000 BTC. CrediBull Crypto revealed that this current Open Interest was in a danger zone. This is because the 14,000 BTC difference typically indicates elevated market activities, which often precede volatile price movements.\n\nAdditionally, the CrediBull Crypto revealed that a single unidentified Bitcoin whale was responsible for approximately 10,000 BTC of the increased 14,000 BTC Open Interest. This means that the anonymous whale controls 70% of all the added Open Interest on Binance perpetual futures since the baseline.\n\nHe also disclosed that in the scenario where the anonymous whale can withstand 10% to 15% downward pressure without liquidating their assets, the actual available Open Interest that would be vulnerable to a decline would be only 4,000 BTC, instead of the initial 14,000 BTC addition. The analyst revealed that out of the 4,000 BTC, some would be directional shorts, noting that the net long positions at risk would be even lower.\n\nGiven this theory, CrediBull Crypto argued that the potential for a downside is more limited. As a result, the ultra bull scenario where Bitcoin’s price surges to new all-time highs was worth considering.\n\nIn his YouTube video, CrediBull Crypto also highlighted a potential retracement slightly above the $60,000 price mark. The analyst predicted a bearish scenario, where Bitcoin could see its price falling significantly towards $62,000 to $63,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $69,774, reflecting a 0.08% decrease in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. CrediBull Crypto disclosed that Bitcoin had failed to break through key resistance levels above $70,000.\n\nHe predicts that consistent declines and liquidations could potentially trigger a bottom below $60,000. However, he also revealed that such a bearish turnaround was highly unlikely at this time, as Bitcoin’s price movements currently indicates an ultra bullish scenario.\n\n",

Analysts believe this approval signals a growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for similar vehicles focused on specific projects like Chainlink.\n\n🔗📈 #Chainlink has climbed well ahead of the #crypto pack, quickly surpassing $17.50 for the first time in 6 weeks. #Onchain today, there are 11 transactions in profit for every 1 $LINK transaction at a loss. This is the highest ratio since Dec. 8, 2022. https://t.co/nILlWsXWNh pic.twitter.com/joMV55V5x7\n\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 24, 2024\n\nTomi Point, a renowned crypto analyst, took to social media to express his belief that Chainlink could be the next beneficiary of the ETF boom.\n\nChainlink’s role in bridging the gap between DeFi and traditional finance makes it a prime candidate for an ETF. Point highlighted Chainlink’s robust DeFi ecosystem, boasting reliable data connections to over 20 blockchains, as a key factor driving its institutional appeal.\n\nThe current market sentiment surrounding Chainlink is overwhelmingly bullish. Despite the Fear \u0026 Greed Index hovering in “extreme fear” territory, most technical indicators point towards a sustained uptrend. As of May 24th, 2024, a majority of technical analysis tools confirmed a positive outlook for LINK.\n\nSeveral analysts have weighed in with bullish price predictions. Digitcoinprice predicts LINK to reach $37.35 by the end of May, representing a staggering 117% increase. The overall optimistic outlook is bolstered by LINK’s impressive performance in the past month, with a price appreciation of over 16%.\n\nMeanwhile, this week’s bullish fluctuations in whale activity on Chainlink are another important sign that shows how popular LINK and other Ethereum-hosted cryptocurrency projects are among investors.\n\nThe Santiment graphic above displays changes in the balances of LINK tokens held by the top 100 largest wallets in real time.\n\nAs of May 19, the top 100 Chainlink investors held 701 million LINK tokens. By May 25, they had increased their holdings by over 1.2 million LINK, totaling 702 million.\n\nFeatured image from Texture X, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin price is now back down to $67,000 after touching above $71,000 earlier in the week, marking an important level.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price is now back down to $67,000 after touching above $71,000 earlier in the week. Given the circumstances surrounding the price recovery and subsequent decline, it has led to crypto analysts breaking out the technical indicators to figure out where the price is headed next. One crypto analyst, in particular, has identified that the cryptocurrency has entered a crucial zone, with important levels to watch that could tell where the price is headed next.\n\nPresently, the break below $70,000 has sent the Bitcoin price into a perilous situation, making the current level just above $67,000 crucial to its next steps. Crypto analyst The Signalyst highlights this in their latest Bitcoin analysis where they identified that the BTC price is at a ‘make or break zone.’\n\nAs The Signalyst points out, Bitcoin had been able to break above the accumulation level between $60,000 and $62,000, which had allowed investors to get in. Despite its decline in the last day, the price has maintained its position in the upper bound of this range.\n\nFor the bullish scenario to continuation, the crypto analyst explains that BTC must go ahead to break the upper bound of this range completely, which is the $72,000. This is the major resistance for bulls. If this happens, then The Signalyst believe that the Bitcoin price will move toward the next major resistance at $80,000.\n\nSimilarly the to bullish scenario, the bearish scenario for Bitcoin could possibility play out at this level. As the The Signalyst points out, even though the price is currently still in the upper bound of the range, it risks being brought down by bears.\n\nIn this case, the level to watch is the lower trend line, which currently sits around $62,000. Much like the resistance at $72,000, the support at $62,000 is what bears must break to pull the price further down. If this scenario were to play out and the bears successfully broke the lower trend line, then the analyst’s chart shows that the Bitcoin price could fall as low as $56,000. This would mean an over 20% decline from its current price.\n\nBTC Price\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin price is still seeing some bullish momentum, with its daily trading volume rising over 40% in the last 24 hours alone. This suggests that investors are still actively engaging with the cryptocurrency, something that could drive the price higher.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $67,300, with a 3.29% loss in the last day, but still holding small gains of 1.68% on the weekly chart.\n\n",

    "content": "Meme coin market started as internet jokes and digital playthings and now is the fastest-growing branch within the crypto world. As of today, the market cap stands at $62 billion with a total of 755 coins, making it an inevitable part of every investor’s journey.\n\nMany traders have made their biggest returns investing in meme coins. Bonk and Pepe have had more than a 25% rise in value in this week alone. Also, Dogecoin had decent surges with a solid 5% price increase.\n\nAll this indicates that the future is in meme coins and it comes as no surprise that the top market analysts suggest looking into projects like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sponge V2.\n\nLet’s see below what they’re all about.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nFirst, let’s learn the basics of each coin.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nNow, let’s check out the details.\n\nDogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is the first coin to leverage multiple blockchain interoperability, operating across Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Base, and Solana. These blockchains collectively enhance Dogeverse’s speed, cost-efficiency, and overall effectiveness.\n\n\n\nLeading the project is Cosmo, a chain-hopping doge, whose design aims to capitalize on the popularity of similar dog-oriented projects.\n\nThe presale has been a tremendous success, raising over $15 million, which has generated substantial buzz and excitement. With this achievement, Dogeverse is entering its final phase. Priced at just $0.0031 per $DOGEVERSE, it presents a phenomenal opportunity for those looking to get involved in the next big cryptocurrency trend.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSealana ($SEAL) is a chubby seal who has dived deep into the Solana Sea. Once fit, he’s now glued to his PC, growing larger each day on a diet of chips and canned tuna. His obsession with finding the best Solana meme coins keeps him constantly busy.\n\nInspired by the South Park World of Warcraft guy, Sealana is the latest SOL meme coin, launching with a ‘Send to Wallet’ style presale. Rumor has it that the creators of the viral\n\nSLERF token, which saw huge gains in March 2024, are behind Sealana.\n\n\n\nUsers can purchase $SEAL either through the website widget or by sending SOL directly to the presale wallet.\n\nThe project has already seen significant success, raising over $2.5 million. Currently, one $SEAL costs $0.022, but this price will increase as the presale progresses, so early participation is recommended.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nWienerAI ($WAI) is a new dog-themed meme coin following in the footsteps of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Myro. Right now, you can buy WienerAI in a token presale that’s happening in stages, with each stage having a slightly higher token price.\n\n\n\nYou need to connect your Ethereum wallet to the presale site and use ETH or USDT to make your purchase. Once you have $WAI tokens, you can start staking them right away to earn rewards. Keep in mind, though, that as more tokens are staked, the rewards might decrease.\n\nRight now you can get 1 $WAI for $0.000709 and that price is going to change really fast because $80k more is needed for the next phase to start. As of now, the project raised $2.6 million and that number is going to rise even more in the future.\n\nAfter the presale ends, WienerAI plans to launch a new AI trading bot for crypto, further making it stand out from the sea of Doge-related meme coins.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy WienerAI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nSponge V2 ($SPONGE) is an enhanced and upgraded version of the V1. This revamped version aims to build on the success of the original, which saw a remarkable 100x price surge and reached a $100 million market cap.\n\n\n\nTo obtain V2 tokens, investors must bridge them from their existing V1 holdings. Those willing to stake and permanently lock their V1 tokens stand to receive a substantial reward – four years of staking rewards paid in $SPONGE V2. This incentivizes early adoption of the new token.\n\nOne of the main objectives is securing listings on major exchanges like Binance and OKX. Such listings could significantly amplify $SPONGE V2’s visibility and adoption, potentially reigniting the token’s momentum and driving its valuation beyond the $100 million mark once again. Right now the project has staked and bridged around $22 million.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sponge V2 Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nMemereum ($MEME) is a new crypto project that offers blockchain insurance to protect crypto assets and fiat currencies from inflation. It’s also launching a decentralized exchange for token swaps.\n\nIn the presale phase, over 16 million tokens have been sold, indicating high investor interest. Tokens are available for purchase on the BNB Smart Chain at $0.035 each. The first Memereum NFT will be free for users holding $250 or more in $MEME tokens.\n\nBy mid-2024, Memereum plans to launch its app and NFT collection, followed by a crypto lending platform and a Memereum Visa Debit Card by August 2024.\n\nMemereum’s diverse offerings and growth potential make it an exciting project in the crypto space.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e Buy the Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c\n\nMeme coin market has always sparked interest and debates among investors and the recent market cap milestone confirmed that the hype is well worth it.\n\nThis meteoric rise isn’t just about funny memes and viral moments—it’s a testament to the power of social media, the thrill of speculation, and the strong sense of community-driving meme tokens.\n\nThat’s why numerous industry sources are pointing out that the potential for the biggest returns lies in the meme coin presales, specifically Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), WienerAI ($WAI) and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE).\n\nAll these coins have strong community backing, straightforward tokenomics, and big hype surrounding them so make sure to get them while they’re cheap!\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Tokens like Jupiter and NEAR have historically delivered substantial returns to investors through features like optimal liquidity and robust network security. However, Raboo ($RABT), a new presale token in the meme ecosystem, has swiftly gained traction among investors with purchases now exceeding the $1 million mark.\n\nRaboo’s emergence has continued to inspire market frenzy, with the token being tipped as one of the best cryptos to invest in by several analysts. But amidst the dominance of Jupiter and NEAR, can Raboo emerge as the best altcoin to buy in 2024? Let’s find out!\n\nThis month, Jupiter unveiled its ambitious “Grand Unified Markets” initiative, signaling a significant expansion in its market offerings. The initiative which aims to integrate “all assets” onto the Solana blockchain and index them within the Jupiter ecosystem positions Jupiter to soar this month and solidifies its ranking as one of the best altcoins to invest in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Jupiter has also partnered with market makers and real-world assets projects, laying the groundwork for the inclusion of forex, stocks, and real-world assets alongside cryptocurrencies. In collaboration with these partners, Jupiter will work towards creating liquid markets for a wider range of assets on Solana, enhancing the platform’s scope and accessibility.\n\nJupiter’s evolution from a DeFi app to a comprehensive platform for asset tokenization reflects a growing trend in both the crypto and traditional finance sectors. Jupiter aims to become a pioneering venue for tokenization on a large scale by facilitating the efficient swapping and movement of tokenized assets. This move will ultimately position Jupiter for more growth this month.\n\nThis month, Mercuryo, a global payments infrastructure provider, announced the integration of its on-ramp solutions into Meteor Wallet, which is the interface for managing digital tokens and accessing DeFi services and decentralized applications (dApps) on the NEAR blockchain.\n\nThis integration will further bolster accessibility of the Near token, as Meteor Wallet now allows users to seamlessly purchase digital assets using credit and debit cards or Apple Pay. This integration has spurred a 14.50% growth in NEAR’s trading activity this month, further demonstrating to investors that it is one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024.\n\nNEAR Protocol has also previously demonstrated impressive growth, with its token surging by 54% in late December alone, contributing to a remarkable yearly gain of 412%. This surge is attributed to heightened on-chain activity and sustained interest, showcasing NEAR’s resilience and attractiveness to investors despite market fluctuations.\n\nExperts have predicted a remarkable 10x surge for Raboo, the new AI-powered token currently making waves in the crypto industry. This forecast signals a paradigm shift in meme-driven cryptocurrencies and fuels excitement among crypto enthusiasts towards Raboo ($RABT).\n\nWith its innovative fusion of cutting-edge technology and precise AI integration, Raboo emerges as a frontrunner in the industry, offering investors a groundbreaking opportunity to shape the future of meme culture.\n\nAlready being tipped as one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, Raboo’s tokenomics not only incentivize early participation but also foster community engagement, setting a new standard for meme-driven coins. Its revolutionary approach aims to redefine the meme industry through technology, promising unparalleled benefits for token holders and reshaping the landscape of digital entertainment.\n\nAs analysts project a staggering 233% growth during the presale and a potential 100x surge on launch day, Raboo is poised to connect meme enthusiasts worldwide, fostering a vibrant community and offering exciting opportunities for monetizing social media content through its innovative Post-to-Earn platform.\n\nAlthough Jupiter and NEAR have demonstrated significant growth and garnered widespread attention within their respective niches, Raboo has emerged as a compelling investment opportunity, poised to disrupt the meme-driven coin market with its innovative features.\n\nWith a forecast predicting a remarkable 10x surge for Raboo’s token this month, investors have the chance to capitalize on this promising venture and be part of a dynamic community shaping the future of digital entertainment.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here.\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Utility tokens of L2 blockchains serve various purposes, from granting access to ecosystem offerings to paying fees and beyond. One such token that has been garnering significant attention lately is CHO. Serving as the backbone of Choise.ai, CHO already had numerous use cases. However, the announcement of Choise.ai’s upcoming L2 blockchain, Entropy, is supposed to give CHO a substantial boost. Other utility tokens with room for growth include ARB, OP, STRK, and IMX, and we’ll explain why we believe each of these tokens can explode in the medium to long term.\n\nAs mentioned above, Choise.ai announced the forthcoming launch of Entropy, an L2 blockchain focused on B2B and enterprise, and powered by AI. CHO will lay the foundation for Entropy’s long-term growth, fostering its scalability and sustainability.\n\nThis L2 will offer a no-code environment for those seeking to create, build, and flourish in the realm of Web3. This will be accomplished through the use of AI models for smart contract generation and optimization, completely eliminating human error, ensuring seamless operation, and reducing costs simultaneously. Additionally, developers will have the opportunity to monetize their AI models through integration with a blockchain-based AI model marketplace. This level of innovation has not been seen on any other blockchain, and it will be incredibly exciting to see how things unfold from here.\n\nCHO holders will be given various kinds of benefits, such as access to new platform features, airdrops, partner rewards, and more. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Other perks of holding CHO include receiving up to 20% of Choise.ai’s B2B revenue through the soon-to-be-launched VLT token, which will be exclusively credited to CHO holders, giving a super boost to their staking income. CHO will also incentivize legitimate transactions within Choise.ai’s innovative Tringlr SMPC technology, which will serve as the base for ultra-secure digital wallets. Lastly, the token was recently launched on the BSC network, with a $500,000 prize pool for transfers to BSC, aligning with Choise.ai’s vision of supporting community programs and reducing transaction costs.\n\nGiven all this, it’s clear that CHO has potential matched by very few other tokens. It’s a hidden gem for anyone seeking tokens with great utility. And with the impending launch of Entropy, CHO is about to get to new heights.\n\nARB is the utility token of the Arbitrum Network, launched in May 2021 with the aim of enhancing scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness compared to the ETH network. Indeed, Arbitrum can handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency.\n\nARB tokens are also used for governance within the Arbitrum DAO and serve as rewards for validation nodes. Validators can stake tokens on the network, thereby enhancing its security.\n\nDespite its strengths, ARB has encountered several challenges. For example, during the ARB airdrop scheduled for last March, a significant percentage of intended recipients, around 10,000, did not receive their tokens, while some who did were subject to high fees. Although the team resolved the issues, some participants were left with a bitter taste, leading them to exit the project.\n\nOptimism, another L2 solution, utilizes optimistic rollups, which are cheaper than pessimistic rollups, enabling smooth transaction processing without causing network congestion or exorbitant fees. These optimistic rollups ensure network security with most transactions being executed automatically, but if a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent, the system undergoes a verification process to confirm its legitimacy.\n\nThe OP token has two main functions: operations and governance. Holders can vote on upgrades and proposals, earn rewards for contributions to the network, and stake their tokens.\n\nHowever, the main problem with this network, which you could already guess, pertains to security. While the fraud-proof scheme theoretically works, there are instances where fraudulent transactions or actions go undetected, leaving the network vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors.\n\nStarknet is a ZK rollup for Ethereum and a Layer 2 blockchain that ensures high performance, security, and low fees using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Although the blockchain is still in development, its native token, STRK, was airdropped to the community in February.\n\nThere’s a lot of excitement around Starknet, and its developer community is quite strong. Anyone looking to build on Starknet can find resources in their Developer Hub, and Cairo, the network’s native smart contract language, further simplifies things for developers.\n\nLike most other L2 native tokens, STRK can be staked, used for governance, paying transaction fees, and maintaining the network. Soon, it is expected to release a range of data availability solutions and a permissionless sequencer and prover. Although the project overall seems promising, there are some posts on Reddit suggesting it could be a pump-and-dump scenario orchestrated by venture capitalists.\n\nImmutable X is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum NFTs that supports both NFT minting and trading with no fees, is carbon-neutral, and incredibly fast, achieving up to 9,000 transactions per second.\n\nWhat sets it apart from other NFT marketplaces is that trades are executed instantly, ZK rollups provide high security, it includes a built-in wallet, has a global order book that aggregates NFTs from different marketplaces, and offers APIs and SDKs that make it easy for developers to build Web3 apps.\n\nThe platform’s native token, IMX, is its first and native NFT. The IMX token is used for paying transaction fees, voting, and staking on Immutable X. These tokens can also be locked in staking pools. However, despite the project’s overall strength and the token’s potential, it may not appeal to people who are not interested in NFTs.\n\nIt looks like 2024 is the year of L2 native tokens, and since we’re almost halfway through, some of the listed tokens have already appreciated significantly, while others still have room to grow. However, among the five, it’s clear that CHO has the greatest utility. Entropy will offer a much broader range of possibilities compared to other L2s, making CHO a token with immense potential. At its current price, it’s definitely a steal and could be a good buy.\n\n",

Marks forecasts a staggering 351% surge for CHZ, sending its price soaring to a projected $0.63.\n\nThis bullish prediction comes amidst a recent upswing for CHZ, marked by a decisive break above a key resistance level. Marks interprets this technical indicator as a sign of a sustained uptrend, potentially setting the stage for a significant price run.\n\n$CHZ (Chiliz) price has returned here with major strength and continues to hold free and broken out of a key resisting trend which can imply a much larger run to be developing!\n\nWith this breakout holding, a near +351% run from here to $0.63755 could be a matter of time and still… https://t.co/w25MaWhxm5 pic.twitter.com/zSE2kPnfd0\n\n— JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) May 25, 2024\n\nCHZ’s unique value proposition lies in its innovative approach to fan engagement. By leveraging blockchain technology, CHZ empowers fans to forge deeper connections with their favorite teams and personalities through fan tokens.\n\nThese tokens grant fans exclusive voting rights on certain club decisions, access to unique content and merchandise, and a chance to participate in the ever-evolving world of digital collectibles.\n\nThis approach has resonated with sports fans globally, propelling CHZ to the forefront of the crypto market. The potential for increased fan engagement through CHZ tokens has attracted a loyal following, further bolstering the token’s potential.\n\nMarks’ optimistic outlook has ignited a wave of investor confidence in CHZ. The prospect of a 351% surge has captivated both seasoned crypto veterans and newcomers seeking a lucrative entry point into the market.\n\nHowever, Marks emphasizes the importance of maintaining the current breakout level for CHZ. He believes that staying above this resistance level is paramount to sustaining the bullish trend and maximizing potential gains.\n\nThe asset’s price has experienced a 35% increase over the past year, indicating strong performance and upward momentum. This positive trend is further supported by its current trading position above the 200-day simple moving average, a key technical indicator suggesting sustained bullish sentiment and potential for continued growth.\n\nAdditionally, the asset’s high liquidity, as evidenced by its substantial market capitalization, ensures that it can be traded efficiently without significant price volatility. This combination of recent price appreciation, favorable technical indicators, and robust liquidity positions the asset as a potentially attractive investment opportunity.\n\nFeatured image from National Agricultural Advisory Services, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "After enduring a 20% correction, and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, BTC has managed to stage a strong comeback.\n\n",
    "content": "After enduring a significant 20% price correction earlier this month that saw Bitcoin fall below $56,400 and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has managed to stage a strong comeback. It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone.\n\nThe resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated:\n\nThe inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.\n\nNotably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million.\n\nBeyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March.\n\nThe renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital has pointed out that despite Bitcoin recording a bull flag breakout confirmation, the asset still needs to secure a daily close above $67,000 to continue its trend of higher highs and confirm the potential for further upside.\n\nThe analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process. As part of this, Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin should be able to revisit the range high of $71,500 over time.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is trading at $68,130, up a substantial 9% in the last week alone and over 8% in the last fourteen days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency world is witnessing a familiar sight: a meme coin on fire. PEPE, a token emblazoned with the internet’s favorite frog, has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leaving investors wondering if this is the dawn of a new era or a fleeting fad.\n\nOver the past month, PEPE has been on a tear, exceeding expectations and leaving a trail of green for investors. The price triumphantly reached a new all-time high, surging over 100% in just 30 days. This astronomical rise translated to happy hodlers, with IntoTheBlock data revealing that a whopping 97% were sitting pretty in profit.\n\nCoinGecko data show that Pepe has risen 56% in the previous week and 99% in the last month, recovering its position as the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization from Dogwifhat (WIF).\n\nThe bullish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. The past 24 hours saw another surge of 3.7%, further propelling PEPE to its current peak. This impressive performance has garnered significant attention, not just financially, but also on social media. The coin’s social volume has spiked, indicating a surge in interest and online chatter.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a whale, a term used for large investors with significant buying power, has been making waves. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, recently reported a whale withdrawing a staggering 500 billion PEPE from Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This mass accumulation suggests a whale-sized vote of confidence in PEPE’s future.\n\nWhile the recent price increase and social media buzz are undoubtedly positive signs, some analysts are urging caution. A closer look at technical indicators reveals potential signs of an overheated market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures buying and selling pressure, has registered a decline.\n\nSimilarly, the Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are both hovering in the overbought zone, suggesting PEPE’s price might be due for a correction.\n\nFurther complicating the picture is the presence of selling pressure. While some investors are piling in, others might be cashing out on their profits. Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, observed a rise in PEPE’s exchange outflow last week, indicating buying pressure. However, they also noted an increase in supply on exchanges, suggesting some investors might be taking advantage of the high price to sell.\n\nNewsBTC analyzed PEPE’s daily chart to gauge the impact of this potential selling pressure. Their analysis suggests that the price might first fall to $0.0000122 before potentially finding support and initiating another bull run. However, a deeper correction could see PEPE plummet to $0.000010 or even lower.\n\nMeanhwhile, Pepe was still among the most traded cryptocurrency assets over the previous day, according to data from Binance, with only BNB Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) surpassing it.\n\nPepe continues to be the most traded meme coin, surpassing popular coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Floki (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nFeatured image from ART street, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Veteran crypto trader, Peter Brandt has issued a warning to the broader crypto community, stating that the industry has yet to experience its biggest disaster. Brandt boldly predicts that this catastrophe will be linked to cryptocurrency staking and the people involved in it.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 24, Brandt labeled crypto staking as one of the biggest threats to the digital currency space. According to the analyst, staking could become the harbinger of disaster for the industry, potentially causing the decline of the market’s reputation and leading to financial losses for traders.\n\nFor more clarity, staking is a popular practice in the crypto industry that involves locking assets for an extended period to help support the blockchain. This allows token holders to participate as validators of the blockchain and earn staking rewards.\n\nBrandt cautioned that digital currency enthusiasts and traders involved in staking should be careful as it could potentially lead to bankruptcy and loss of fortune. He believes that staking may bring shocking future events that could possibly devastate the space.\n\nIn a follow-up post, the trader outlined a progression of events related to staking, highlighting its potential negative impacts on the market.\n\nHe disclosed that crypto staking involves owning, borrowing or leveraging an asset such as Solana and Ethereum. These assets are usually lent out to earn possible revenue, often in the form of interest.\n\nAs staking becomes more widespread and accepted, it could attract the attention and involvement of Central Banks, government treasuries and other governmental authorities. Brandt reveals that this attention may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of the staking process by the government.\n\nConsequently, the introduction of new regulations would have a detrimental effect on the crypto space, fundamentally changing the industry or possibly leading to the end of staking.\n\nBefore issuing his controversial statement about crypto staking, Brandt disclosed that his opinions may not be well received by supporters of popular digital assets such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nTrue to this prediction, many community members dismissed Brandt’s warning that staking could potentially bring disaster to the crypto space. A crypto member criticized Brandt for his statement, asserting that the crypto trader was uninformed about staking processes and was overstating the impacts of staking by claiming it would result in a “disaster.”\n\nAnother crypto member had argued that Brandt’s definition of staking was factually incorrect. He clarified that staking was a process of using coins or tokens to verify and secure the consensus mechanism of a blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, a crypto community member, Tony Edward disclosed that the only risks in staking are associated with Centralized Exchanges (CEX), not with self custody staking.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "The recent approval of the Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday has sparked speculation on the next price movements for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency as the trading launch date approaches.\n\nHowever, significant transfers of Ethereum (ETH) to cryptocurrency exchanges have raised concerns about profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and potential market speculation.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these developments coincide with Ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilke transferring 10,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.\n\nFurthermore, the surge in Ethereum balances on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates a notable increase in tokens available for sale.\n\nThe chart below shows that more than 242,000 ETH have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchange wallets over the past two weeks, signaling increased trading activity that can contribute to price volatility.\n\nThis trend, coupled with Wilke’s transfer, suggests the possibility of a sell-off or an increase in profit-taking among market participants.\n\nWhile industry experts like Anthony Pompliano view the Ethereum ETF approval as a positive sign for the entire industry, traders are advised to exercise caution. For Martinez, the growing number of ETH deposits to exchange wallets implies a potential market reaction characterized by profit-taking or selling pressure.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart, indicating the potential for a retracement or a new downward countdown phase before the upward trend resumes.\n\nDiving into the price analysis, considering the IOMAP (Input-Output Model and Profitability) data, Martinez highlights that Ethereum has a strong demand zone between $3,820 and $3,700, where over 1.81 million addresses bought approximately 1.66 million ETH.\n\nThis range could provide support amid increasing selling pressure. However, if this zone fails to hold, the next key area of support lies between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses acquired over 1.50 million ETH.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum’s most significant resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054, with over 1.16 million addresses purchasing around 574,660 ETH.\n\nMartinez suggests that a daily candlestick close above $4,170 would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially trigger a new upward countdown phase, with a target towards $5,000.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH’s price is $3,719, reflecting a 2.5% retracement over the past 24 hours. However, according to the analyst’s assessment, Ethereum remains within a crucial demand zone.\n\nAs the market approaches the launch and commencement of trading for all eight spot Ethereum ETF applications by the world’s largest asset managers, the exact impact on price action is yet to be fully realized.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "summary": "Crypto Con has predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach its peak in the ongoing bull cycle, based on past BTC peaks.\n\n",
    "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to witness heightened optimism and confidence from investors, Crypto Con, a popular crypto analyst, and enthusiast has predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach its peak in the ongoing bull cycle, based on past BTC runs and their cumulative peaks.\n\nBy analyzing historical data, Crypto Con has identified trends that might pinpoint the time the largest cryptocurrency asset by market reaches its highest point in this cycle. According to the expert, the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) Ergodic Indicator shows that Bitcoin is exactly where it should be in the current bull cycle.\n\nAt this point, Crypto Con believes there is still a lot of room for growth in the upcoming days. Thus, BTC’s current position, which is around a year from cycle peaks, places this cycle’s peak between January and February of 2025. However, December 2024 remains the analyst’s focus, which, at the current rate, is expected to be the cycle’s top month.\n\nCrypto Con further hinted at the recent recovery from a perfectly healthy correction observed in the crypto market as a potential catalyst to drive the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nThe post read:\n\nThe SMI tells us that Bitcoin is right where it should be in the cycle, with much more room for growth. Our current position lines up at about 1 year from cycle tops, which would make this cycle’s top in Jan – Feb 2025. My eye is still on December 2024, a likely cycle top month at our current rate.\n\nGiven that the analyst previously predicted BTC to reach $149,000 by the end of the year, it could mean the expert expects the asset to top out at the level by December. “Bitcoin is still on track for a layer 7 price target of $149,000 by the end of this year,” he stated.\n\nCrypto Con’s prediction is in line with the most precise measurements for Log Regression Curves and the cycle tops in 2021. By then, the more cautious layer 6, which is the layer that denoted the 2013 cycle top, aims to reach the $108,000 level.\n\nDuring the prediction, the expert highlighted a price consolidation, which is a new development in this cycle. However, as volatility decreases, this consolidation is accurate.\n\nCrypto Con has also utilized the Fibonacci Extensions to determine the Bitcoin price peak this cycle. According to cycle retraces highlighted in his chart, the first two cycles approached the 2.618 extension quite closely, while the last struck the 1.618 extension.\n\nOn the possibility that the 1.618 point will repeat itself this cycle, BTC’s price will be at $159,128. “This is one of the many perspectives to be balanced in the basket of possibilities, and I would consider this estimate to be on the optimistic for this cycle,” he added.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is slowly gaining momentum toward $70,000, indicating a 5% increase in the past week. Its market cap is down by 0.25%, while its trading volume is down by 12% in the past 24 hours.\n\n",

    "content": "The development of Web3 ecosystems is a significant milestone in the digital domain. They use decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can transform several industries.\n\nThese ecosystems aim to modify our approach to managing digital assets, data, and transactions, transforming online interactions as we now understand them.\n\nWhile there is widespread excitement about Web3, it is crucial to remember that mere popularity does not guarantee sustained success. Several platforms have had challenges sustaining their progress due to a deficiency in ongoing community engagement and expansion.\n\nThe main support mechanism of a robust Web3 ecosystem is its capacity to attract and retain developers. These ecosystems’ applications, innovations, and structures are mostly the developers’ work.\n\nThree main criteria drive their engagement: security, speed, and pricing. Developers seek platforms that provide economical solutions to optimize their spending and manage resources effectively.\n\nAdditionally significant is speed since developers must quickly offer applications and transactions to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. Similar importance is attached to security; developers want tight guidelines and protections to keep their data and assets secure from threats.\n\nWeb3 platforms hoping to establish a vibrant developer community must adhere to the 80/20 rule. This concept holds that creating an environment that fully satisfies developer needs should receive 80% of the work. Platforms that stress building safe, efficient, and reasonably priced infrastructure may provide a solid foundation for developer participation and innovation.\n\nNonetheless, the remaining 20% of funds must be allocated to outreach and incentive initiatives. Although a good environment attracts developers, intentional outreach and incentive schemes are needed to boost community growth and maintain involvement.\n\nPlatforms may effectively include developers through clever partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and special incentive plans, creating a vibrant ecosystem driven by collaboration and creativity.\n\nProm, a Layer 2 solution aimed at improving interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, is one platform that uses incentive programs. It sends transaction proofs to additional chains on the selected Settlement chain, boosting connections across ecosystems.\n\nProm, powered by Polygon, reduces transaction costs using zkSNARKs technology, making it a low-cost blockchain solution. It also uses Polygon Zero and powerful recursive STARK technology for quick transactions and scalable dApp development, which appeals to both developers and consumers. Furthermore, Prom’s EVM-equivalent design facilitates integration with the current Ethereum infrastructure, simplifying development and lowering costs.\n\nProm emphasizes aggressive marketing and comprehensive incentive schemes to increase network participation and foster a dynamic community. It works with teams and products that are vital to the expansion of the ecosystem, as well as providing grants and assistance to projects that contribute to Prom’s development.\n\nProm’s incentive scheme includes a referral program that pays users $PROM tokens to introduce friends and expand its user base. In addition, Prom provides fee kickback rates ranging from 10% to 50% to encourage community members to actively participate in the referral program.\n\nTo build a favorable environment for developers in Web3 ecosystems, platforms must solve their primary concerns: price, speed, and security. They should strive to create cost-effective solutions that enable developers to effectively manage resources and maximize the value of their investments.\n\nSpeed is also important since developers must launch applications quickly and interface with blockchain networks smoothly to remain competitive. Strong security measures are also required to safeguard developers’ assets and data from attacks while increasing confidence in the platform.\n\nSuccessful systems that focus on developer demands provide useful examples. They have incorporated novel methods to increase price, speed, and security, creating a community where developers can interact and contribute. Partnerships, infrastructure optimization, and support campaigns have made these platforms ideal for developers seeking to construct and deploy decentralized apps.\n\nHowever, establishing the best atmosphere for developers is a continuous effort. Platforms must be adaptive, always monitoring and adapting to changes in developer expectations and market trends. Platforms that respond to feedback may improve their products to better suit developers’ changing demands.\n\nThis continual adaption is critical for being competitive and relevant in the ever-changing Web3 scene, as it ensures that platforms remain appealing and useful to developers looking to cooperate and create within decentralized ecosystems.\n\nBuilding strong and long-lasting communities on Web3 platforms isn’t without its challenges. Maintaining relevance in continual technological and business upheavals is a major challenge.\n\nPlatforms also struggle with the harmony between decentralization and governance to include the community while preserving direction. Platforms try to welcome individuals from all origins and points of view; hence, it might be difficult to guarantee diversity and inclusion in the community.\n\nThe long-term sustainability of Web3 platforms relies on their use of focused operations and strategic approaches. It takes open and honest channels of communication that promote trust and collaboration for platforms to deal with problems and seek guidance. Those who can access educational resources and support services could become more active and transform their communities. If we want to create a warm environment where everyone feels valued, diversity and inclusion programs must be encouraged.\n\nPlatforms should also prioritize scalability and interoperability in order to collaborate with other networks and adjust to the community’s evolving requirements. By making partnerships and funding strong technological infrastructure, platforms could overcome large-scale challenges and promote innovation. Using decentralized governance techniques, community members may acquire agency and guarantee that decisions are made openly and advantageously.\n\nBuilding a strong Web3 group takes a lot of time, work, and money. It’s more important to be proactive and thoughtful than to be famous for a short time. To be successful in the difficult Web3 environment over the long term, platforms must focus on community-building projects.\n\nBy investing in involvement and partnerships and adapting to changing needs, platforms can build strong communities that encourage working together and creativity. I want platforms to take action and focus on building active and welcoming communities. This will set the stage for future growth and development in the Web3 environment.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Lido (LDO), the liquid staking protocol for the Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, has seen a significant price spike in the last 24 hours following the long-awaited approval of spot Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.\n\nThe protocol’s native token, LDO, has successfully regained the $2.30 level and is looking to break out of its one-month downtrend structure that has been in place since the market correction in April.\n\nAs reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, the SEC’s approval of the Ethereum ETFs was detailed in an official filing, highlighting that the proposals meet the provisions of the Exchange Act and relevant regulations governing national securities exchanges.\n\nThe Commission has determined that proposals from notable entities such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark Invest/21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton fulfill the requirements to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and safeguard the public interest.\n\nCrypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, commenting on the Ethereum ETF approval on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the new index funds approval has led to two sectors emerging as clear winners.\n\nOne of these sectors is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) coins, with Lido at the forefront. Lido provides staking support for the Ethereum blockchain without the need to lock tokens or maintain infrastructure, allowing participants to engage in on-chain activities such as lending and farming.\n\nDuring the early hours of Friday, LDO reached a peak of $2.49 but has since retraced to its current trading price of $2.35. Large investors are interested in the token, as Spot On Chain data reveals that six fresh wallets/whales withdrew 4.3 million LDO ($9.59 million) from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis indicates a growing interest in holding the token, as sentiment suggests a potential increase in price parallel to Ethereum once the newly approved index funds for the second-largest cryptocurrency enter the market in the coming months.\n\nMoreover, CoinGecko data shows that Lido has experienced a trading volume of $350 million within the last 24 hours, marking a 78.60% increase compared to Thursday’s. However, the token remains 68% below its all-time high (ATH) of $7.30, achieved during the 2021 bull market.\n\nLooking ahead, bullish investors should closely observe the next resistance level on the LDO/USD daily chart, situated at $2.55. Breaking this level is crucial for breaking the downtrend structure that has persisted over the past month, potentially leading to retests at $2.70 and $2.90.\n\nConversely, the $2.21 zone serves as a significant support level, as it acted as a strong barrier for Lido in the past week and a half before the breakout.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, appears poised for a major move, but the direction remains shrouded in mystery. Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his “Euphoric Bull” theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase.\n\nCheckmate’s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a “Euphoric Bull” phase.\n\n#Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull.\n\nIt also coincides with the MVRV ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt.\n\nBull…Crab…Bull… A… pic.twitter.com/4YyD179LRS\n\n— _Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️ (@_Checkmatey_) May 21, 2024\n\nHowever, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout.\n\n\n\nBitcoin’s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors.\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend.\n\nHowever, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs.\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency in 2025. The high-end prediction of $168,459 represents a staggering potential increase, fueled by factors like historical price trends and the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. Buoying this optimism are technical indicators pointing towards a “Bullish” market sentiment with a hefty dose of “Extreme Greed.”\n\nHowever, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon.\n\nFeatured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "— Author: Kevin Roberts\n\nBitcoin’s future is rather intriguing, to say the least. The pioneer of cryptocurrency has become a pillar of the investment industry and continues to break records on a regular basis. 10,000 BTC was worth two pizzas back in 2010, but one single BTC today is worth north of $60,000.\n\n\n\nLARGEST SWISS BANK OWNS BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/ZX8HkW5pwI\n\n— borovik (@3orovik) May 13, 2024\n\nLet’s take a look at Bitcoin’s history to see if it’s better as a short-term or long-term investment, or if it’s both!\n\nBitcoin has become one of the most well-known investments around the world. Even if you are not a tech-genius, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of it. Everyone might not understand how it all works, but what most people know is that it’s worth a lot of money.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin is still very recent, in the grand scheme of things. At the beginning, the price of one Bitcoin was $0.00099. That’s right, not even worth a single penny. Nowadays, it’s worth upwards of $60,000.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Bitcoin’s highest price ever was $73,835.57, which happened on March 14th of 2024. 10,000 BTC bought you two pizzas (roughly $40) back in 2010, but now, just one BTC can buy more than 7,300 pies.\n\nObviously, Bitcoin is used for more than just pizza purchases. It’s now recognized as a currency in several countries, including the United States, El Salvador, Japan, India, China, and others. You can do a lot of different things with Bitcoin, such as using it for everyday purchases, gambling with it at crypto accepted casinos, and more.\n\nWe might be able to get a glimpse of Bitcoin’s future by taking a look at the past. It has come a long way since it opened at $0.00099, but it was not a smooth ride. The price of Bitcoin has been quite high in recent memory, but it has plummeted several times in the past.\n\n\n\n(source: investing.com)\n\nBitcoin was worth just under $6 back in 2012, but it surpassed the $100 mark in April of 2013. It was jus under $1,000 in late 2013, but fell back down to about $230 in February of 2015. It cracked $1,000 about two years later (2017), but this time it went all the way up to about $17,000.\n\nTwo years after reaching nearly $17,000, Bitcoin took a $10,000 drop and ended up at around $7,000 entering 2020. It was then that Bitcoin really started to boom. A lot of people got into investing after the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bitcoin’s price soared to over $60,000 for the first time.\n\nEverything started going back to normal shortly after and people decided to sell. Bitcoin’s price dropped to just $17,000 in late December of 2022, but has steadily climbed since then. Not long after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, it topped its previous record high at $73,835.57 a few weeks ago, and has been sitting above $62,000 since.\n\nWhat do these ups and downs teach us about Bitcoin? Well, it seems that there’s about an equal chance that it will either break it’s previous all-time record, or plummet back down.\n\nThe main thing that everyone is wondering is if they should invest in Bitcoin or not. Truth be told, there’s not really a right or wrong answer. It mainly has to do with personal preferences, as well as the amount of risk you are willing to take.\n\nAs we’ve seen throughout Bitcoin’s history, it seems as if the chances of it rising or falling are about equal to each other. Maybe the recent new all-time high proves that it’s in it for the long haul, but we can’t exactly guarantee that.\n\nFrom both a short-term and long-term perspective, Bitcoin should be looked at as a highly volatile investment. If you are a firm believer in blockchain technology and decentralized currency, I recommend investing in Bitcoin. It can be something that helps you get rich quick, but Bitcoin’s future is not easily predictable.\n\n\n\nImage: Unsplash\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "James Seyffart comments on the possible level of investments the Ethereum spot ETFs could pull compared to their Bitcoin-based equivalents.\n\n",
    "content": "Following the sudden approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF last week, speculations continue to roll in on the potential performance of these funds ahead of their debut trading session. Most recently, renowned Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart has weighed in on the subject giving his thoughts on the possible level of investments the Ethereum spot ETFs could pull in relation to their Bitcoin-based equivalents.\n\nIn an interview session on X on May 24 hosted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, Seyffart stated that the Ether spot ETFs would likely experience a maximum of 25% of the demand seen by the Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart based his predictions on multiple elements starting with enormous differences in market caps between both assets. According to data from CoinMarket, Ethereum’s total market shares are valued at $449.25 billion which is roughly equal to 30% of BTC’s 1.35 trillion market cap.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst also highlighted the large disparities in the difference between both ETFs and their base assets. According to Seyffart, there is a bigger gap between Ethereum as an ETF and as a cryptocurrency than Bitcoin as an ETF and as itself.\n\nThe ETF analyst believes that the ETH spot ETFs will limit investors from native ETH features such as staking, a prominent source of passive income, and other on-chain use cases in terms of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. Thus, certain investors might prefer to invest directly in the altcoin.\n\nWith all these factors in consideration, Seyffart predicts these novel investment funds will produce “big launches” but not at the level of the Bitcoin spot ETFs. He predicts the Ethereum Spot ETFs will record between 20-25% of investments in their Bitcoin-based peers once trading commences. Meanwhile, fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas appears less optimistic with a projection of 15-20%.\n\nUndoubtedly, the performance of the Ethereum spot ETFs will be influential on other crypto spot ETFs that may gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, the XRP ETF is tipped by many enthusiasts as the next debutant in the market but this is still subject to many factors, most especially regulatory clarity on the institutional sales of XRP.\n\nIn other news, Ethereum is trading at $3,766 with a 0.51% gain in the last day. This slight positive performance underscores Ethereum’s form all week with a combined 20.47% gain recorded in the last seven days. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 51.27% and is valued at $10.03 billion.\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out a bullish narrative for Terra Classic (LUNC). Based on his analysis, the crypto token could eventually see a 13x increase from its current price levels. The analyst alluded to LUNC’s historical pattern as what could drive such parabolic price surge.\n\nMarks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LUNC has confirmed a “major bullish pattern,” signaling a continuation of its bullish run to the first price target at $0.00058046. He noted that this move of over 400% was likely to be attained with the crypto token holding above levels that it had earlier broken out from.\n\n\n\nThe crypto analyst then raised the possibility of LUNC making a 1,300% move instead. He claimed that LUNC’s previous breakout and run pattern suggests that three targets could be broken above, meaning that the crypto token rising to the price target of $0.00139122 from here is “possible.”\n\nMarks has remained bullish on LUNC for a while now and has suggested that LUNC’s parabolic rally is a question of when and not if. However, he has failed to provide any specific timeframe for when this move will likely occur. LUNC’s fundamentals are also expected to contribute to this upward trend and push its price to such heights.\n\nOne way that is likely to happen is through the LUNC’s burns, which are carried out regularly. The Terra community has burnt over 113 billion LUNC tokens since the burning initiative came into place following Terra LUNA’s crash in 2022. This has helped reduce the crypto tokens’s circulating supply and could be significant as demand for the token picks up.\n\nIt is worth noting that LUNC is well below its all-time high of $119. However, this suggests that the crypto token has enough room to move significantly to the upside.\n\nGenuine Labs, a Terra Classic developer group, recently announced that the latest version of SDK 47 was ready. The proposed upgrade is expected to be put up for governance voting. The upgrade will introduce significant changes to the Terra network, including a fix to the dyncomm decorator.\n\nFurthermore, the upgrade will handle peer-to-peer (p2p) storms on the network and add new features to the Terrad client, which connects developers to the Terra blockchain. It is uncertain when the proposal will go live, but it should be soon enough.\n\nMeanwhile, the Terra community also recently passed a proposal to make Allnodes an official organization for the community. Allnodes will be the official source for information regarding the circulating supply of LUNC, USTC, and other native tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0001151, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Space.com, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "summary": "On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has provided insights into why the Bitcoin price recently dropped below $70,000.\n\n",
    "content": "On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has provided insights into why the Bitcoin price recently dropped below $70,000. The platform suggested that the flagship isn’t yet seeing enough demand, which could send its price to new highs.\n\nIn one of its latest market reports, Glassnode mentioned that “the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak.” They made this assertion based on the Realized Cap metric, which measures the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was traded. Glassnode claimed that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is currently at $574 billion.\n\nThe platform further revealed that the injection of liquidity into Bitcoin has cooled off since the flagship crypto hit an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This is in stark contrast to the period before Bitcoin hit that ATH, with Glassnode noting that the flows into Bitcoin back then were “extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38 billion daily.”\n\nMeanwhile, Glassnode stated that the Realized Cap “remains in positive profit-dominated territory and is returning towards an equilibrium position.” However, they noted that Bitcoin’s modest demand was still able to spark this recent rally thanks to the “declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors.”\n\nBasically, Glassnode suggested that things were looking up for Bitcoin but that it could be way better if there were more capital inflows. There could indeed be an increase in capital inflows soon enough, considering that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have broken their streak of net outflows and are once again recording impressive net inflows into their funds.\n\nData from Farside Investors shows that these funds have already seen almost $700 million in net inflows this week. Specifically, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $305.7 million on May 21 alone. That day was also BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) most profitable day yet, with the fund taking in $290 million.\n\nGlassnode also assessed some other vital on-chain metrics, which provided some positives for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The platform noted that there has been a “large decline” in Bitcoin’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which “suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.”\n\nTo assess market volatility, they also measured the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days. They concluded that “volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations and prior to large market moves.”\n\nMeanwhile, Glasnode revealed that 2.14M BTC out of the Short-term holder (STH) supply, currently at 3.36M BTC, fell into an unrealized loss following the recent market correction. They claim that this suggests that many of the BTC held by this category of investors are held at an unrealized loss, which reduces the risk of top-heaviness developing.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Bitcoin is retracing at spot rates but one analyst thinks the coin will reach $80,000 by end of May and $95,000 in June\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin is fast-dropping, looking at price action in the daily chart. Even after the impressive spike above $71,500 early this week, there needs to be a conclusive follow-through for optimistic bulls. Despite this correction, one analyst strongly believes Bitcoin will rally sharply, reaching $80,000 by the end of the month.\n\nTaking to X, the analyst thinks HODLers, not speculators, will reap the maximum benefits from Bitcoin. Based on the trader’s assessment, not only will BTC fly above $80,000 by the end of May, but the coin will also spike to peak at $95,000 in June.\n\nAccordingly, reading from the candlestick arrangement, those who position themselves at spot rates might enter at favorable prices, scooping the coin at a discount. Even so, when BTC flies to $95,000 in less than seven weeks from now, the trader expects prices to cool off.\n\nThe retracement will also wash out speculators hitching the leg up.\n\nAt spot rates, the path of least resistance is northward. BTC is also down roughly 6% from this week’s highs, although the uptrend remains. The $72,000 line is emerging as a strong resistance level as prices continue to move horizontally. On the lower end, $60,000 is worth watching.\n\nFor the uptrend to take shape, a high volume must be close to $72,000. Of note is that bulls have yet to breach and close above this line since the surge to all-time highs in mid-March.\n\n\n\nSentiment will play a key role in propelling prices higher. So far, the analyst acknowledges that there is a shift in sentiment. As the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly prepares to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors have been rotating capital to ETH.\n\nThis has slowed the momentum, even lowering prices, as in the current case. The ETHBTC price chart shows that Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, adding 25% from mid-May 2024.\n\nThere has been no official communication from the United States SEC on spot ETH ETF approval. However, the analyst believes the agency will disappoint the market by unexpectedly rejecting all proposals. Should this be the case, the crypto markets will clam up, ending what the trader claims have been “manipulative practices.”\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how the data of an oscillator for Bitcoin could suggest the cryptocurrency still has plenty of room to run in this rally.\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discussed what the latest trend in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for BTC might suggest regarding what could be next for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe VWAP is an indicator that calculates the average price for any asset by taking into account the price fluctuations themselves and weighing the values against the trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume.\n\nTraditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain’s transparency.\n\nThe indicator of interest here isn’t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero.\n\nThe chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years.\n\nThe above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric’s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly.\n\nIn the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency’s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum.\n\nThe resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top. That hasn’t happened for the VWAP Oscillator this time yet. “Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation,” says the analyst. “Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.”\n\nIn other news, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in an X post, retail investors have bought $135.7 million worth of the asset over the past month.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $65,000, up 5% over the last week.\n\n",

Our team of seasoned casino professionals spared no effort in scrutinising dozens of non GamStop casino sites to unveil the best ones with the highest rate of payouts.\n\nAt the foundation of our evaluation of the best non GamStop casino sites lies the legitimacy of the platform. We meticulously examined the licensing and regulatory framework governing each casino, ensuring compliance with stringent standards to guarantee a safe and secure gambling environment.\n\nA diverse and engaging array of games is paramount to a memorable gambling experience. We delved deep into each casino’s game library, assessing the variety, quality, and innovation across slots, table games, live dealer options, and speciality titles.\n\nCentral to our assessment is the payout percentage, a critical metric indicating the return players can expect over the long term. Our team meticulously analysed payout rates across various games, prioritising platforms that offer consistently high RTP (Return to Player) percentages.\n\nWe understand the allure of enticing bonuses and promotions in the competitive world of online gambling. Our experts scrutinised the generosity, terms, and conditions of bonus offers, ensuring they provide genuine value to players without compromising on fairness.\n\nSeamless transactions are essential for a hassle-free gambling experience. We evaluated the diversity, speed, and reliability of payment methods supported by each casino, prioritising platforms that cater to a wide range of preferences and offer swift withdrawals.\n\nIn the dynamic realm of online gambling, responsive and efficient customer support can make all the difference. We assessed the responsiveness, professionalism, and accessibility of customer support channels, prioritising casinos that prioritise player satisfaction.\n\nNavigating a casino’s platform should be intuitive and enjoyable. Our team meticulously examined the user interface, mobile compatibility, and overall user experience, ensuring players can seamlessly immerse themselves in the thrill of gambling.\n\nTrust is paramount in the online gambling industry. We conducted thorough assessments of each casino’s security protocols, encryption methods, and commitment to fairness, ensuring players can gamble with peace of mind.\n\nSome players from the UK who are new to gambling may wonder what GamStop is. Here, we will explain what GamStop is, along with alternative exclusion tools.\n\nGamStop is a free self-exclusion program available to UK residents that helps individuals manage their gambling habits. Once registered, users are blocked from accessing and creating accounts on all online gambling websites and apps licensed by the UK Gambling Commission for a chosen period (6 months, 1 year, or 5 years). This tool is designed to aid those struggling with problem gambling by limiting their ability to gamble online, promoting responsible gambling practices. Users cannot revoke their self-exclusion until the chosen period ends, ensuring a robust barrier against compulsive gambling behaviours.\n\nSimilarly, GamBan is another software tool that helps individuals block access to online gambling sites and apps on their devices. Just like GamStop, it restricts access to thousands of gambling websites and applications, providing a barrier against online gambling across multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. However, unlike GamStop, which is limited to UK-licensed sites, GamBan offers broader protection by blocking gambling content globally.\n\nThere are positive and negative aspects to playing at unrestricted online casinos available to players from the UK. Understanding these pros and cons can help players make informed decisions when considering non-GamStop casinos.\n\nWhile online casinos regulated by the UKGC are required to sign-up to GamStop, non GamStop casino sites are still licensed and regulated, ensuring these sites are safe and fair to play at.\n\nThe best non GamStop casino sites have a gambling licence and are regulated by the following bodies:\n\nCuraçao is one of the oldest and most common licensing jurisdictions for non-GamStop casinos. The Curaçao eGaming licence is known for its relatively straightforward and cost-effective application process. It offers a single licence that covers all types of gambling activities, making it an attractive option for operators. However, while it ensures a basic level of oversight, it may not be as stringent as some other regulators in terms of consumer protection and operational standards.\n\nThe MGA is highly respected within the online gambling industry and is known for its rigorous standards and comprehensive regulatory framework. Casinos licensed by the MGA must adhere to strict rules regarding fair play, player protection, and financial transparency. This makes Malta-licensed casinos generally safer and more reliable for players, even if they are not on GamStop.\n\nReturn to Player (RTP) is a crucial metric for online casino players in the UK, as it indicates the percentage of wagered money a slot of casino games is expected to return to players over time. It can impact gaming choices, trust in the gambling industry, and the overall gaming experience. Let’s break down the main reason why RTP is important:\n\nRTP Helps players make informed decisions about which game to play. Higher RTP% means better chances of winning in the long run, allowing players to choose games that potentially offer more favourable returns.\n\nRTP ensures fairness and transparency. Casinos are required to publish RTP figures, as is a stipulation of obtaining a gambling licence. This gives players confidence that games are not rigged and that they have a fair chance of winning.\n\nUnderstanding RTP allows players to manage their budgets more effectively. By knowing how much a game is likely to retire, players can better plan their spending and gambling strategy.\n\nCasino games with higher RTPs generally provide a more enjoyable experience, as players experience fewer losses and more frequent wins, making the gaming session rewarding and entertaining.\n\nWhile regulations from the UKGC are very strict, most other iGaming licensing bodies also have regulations which adhere to RTP%. This ensures that games meet specific standards of fairness and reliability, protecting players from dodgy practices. It is a red flag if a casino refuses to include the RTP% of the games on their site.\n\nThe most popular payment methods at non-GamStop casinos typically include a mix of traditional and modern options to cater to a diverse player base.\n\nCredit cards are banned from being used at online casinos in the UK which are regulated by UKGC. However, Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted at non-GamStop casinos, offering convenience and familiarity to players who prefer using their bank cards for transactions.\n\nE-wallets like PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller are popular due to their speed, security, and ease of use. They allow for fast deposits and withdrawals, with many players appreciating the additional layer of privacy they provide.\n\nDirect bank transfers or wire transfers are another common payment method at non-GamStop casinos. While they may take longer to process compared to other methods, bank transfers are preferred by players who prioritise security and reliability.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as payment methods at non-GamStop casinos due to their decentralised nature, fast transactions, and enhanced privacy features.\n\nPrepaid cards like Paysafecard are convenient for players who prefer not to share their banking details online. These cards can be purchased at various retail outlets and used to make secure deposits at non-GamStop casinos.\n\nMobile payment services like Apple Pay and Google Pay are becoming increasingly popular for online transactions, offering a seamless and secure way to fund casino accounts using mobile devices.\n\nSome non-GamStop casinos may also accept alternative payment methods like ecoPayz, Trustly, or cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin, providing players with even more options to choose from.\n\nDue to tight regulations from the UKGC on online gambling, players from the UK scour the internet for the best non GamStop casino sites which have high payouts. There is a desire for more freedom and flexibility in their gambling experience, access to a wider range of table games and slots not on GamStop, bigger bonuses, and the avoidance of strict self-exclusion measures imposed by Gamstop. If you find yourself looking for casinos not on GamStop which ticks all these boxes and more, Casino Charles is the casino for you.\n\nIn our expert opinion, Casino Charles is the best casino not on GamStop with the highest payout.\n\nYes, non-GamStop casinos are legal, but they are not licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. Instead, they typically hold licences from other jurisdictions like Curaçao, Malta, or Gibraltar.\n\nPlayers might choose non-GamStop casinos to avoid self-exclusion restrictions, enjoy a wider variety of games, benefit from fewer betting limits, or take advantage of better bonuses and promotions.\n\nYes, UK players can legally play at non GamStop casino sites, but they should be aware that these sites are not regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, which means different consumer protections may apply.\n\nYes, most non-GamStop casinos offer customer support through live chat, email, and sometimes phone. It’s advisable to choose a casino with reliable and responsive customer service.\n\nLook for fastest withdrawal casinos with positive reviews, secure SSL encryption, valid licences from reputable jurisdictions, and transparent terms and conditions. Player testimonials and third-party review sites can also be helpful.\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "Rekt Capital provides an insight into Bitcoin recent price movement and predicts the start of the highly-anticipated bullish run. \n\n",
    "content": "Following the Bitcoin halving in April, analysts and investors remain on the edge of their seats in anticipation of a major price breakout by the maiden cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin did rise to $71,443 in the past week, the token soon suffered a retracement falling as low as $66,936. Interestingly, renowned analyst with X handle Rekt Capital has provided an interesting insight into this recent price movement and also predicted the period BTC may finally embark on a highly-anticipated bullish run.\n\nIn a series of X posts on May 24, Rekt Capital noted that after the halving event, Bitcoin entered the “post-halving danger zone”, a period during which the token lost about 11% of its value. Following this phase, the most-priced cryptocurrency attempted a breakout which encountered a rejection at the range high zone ($71,500) of the macro re-accumulation range.\n\n#BTC\n\nSince the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” ended, Bitcoin broke out to $71500\n\nHowever, ~$71500 is where the Range High resistance of the Macro Re-Accumulation Range is and this is where Bitcoin rejected from\n\nThe consolidation continues and history suggest it will… https://t.co/YjZzimnFj9 pic.twitter.com/JGji7ZYOSe\n\n— Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 24, 2024\n\nFor context, this range represents a long-term consolidation phase where Bitcoin accumulates value before potentially breaking out to new highs. Rekt Capital states that Bitcoin being rejected at the $71,500 price region is quite expected as BTC never breaks through the high side of the re-accumulation range on the first attempt after halving.\n\nBased on historical price data, Rekt Capital anticipates Bitcoin will now remain in consolidation for multiple weeks until 160 days after halving before finally experiencing its major price breakout in September. During this time, the premier cryptocurrency is expected to trade between $60,000 and $70,000 which will result in variations in the portfolio valuation for long-term investors.\n\nHowever, this price consolidation can also present opportunities for these investors to buy Bitcoin near the lower boundary of the range thus consistently accumulating at relatively stable prices. Meanwhile, short-term traders such as swing traders or day traders are likely to capitalize on these expected price fluctuations between an established support and resistance which could result in significant profit.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $68,720, marking a 2.27% gain in the last day, a 2.31% gain over the past week, and a 6.90% increase in the last month. Despite these gains, its daily trading volume has dropped by 45.68%, now valued at $24 billion. BTC is also 6.94% below its all-time high of $73,750. The recent price rise amid declining trading volume suggests cautious investor sentiment, with Bitcoin consolidating within a narrow range as the crypto market leader once again approaches significant resistance levels.\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from Tradingview\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a sea of uncertainty, and Avalanche (AVAX) is no exception. While AVAX has displayed some resilience compared to its altcoin peers, a closer look reveals a market grappling with conflicting signals – a mix of cautious optimism and underlying unease.\n\nThe future of AVAX remains shrouded in uncertainty. While some positive signs exist, like relative outperformance and pockets of bullish sentiment, they are countered by concerning metrics like dwindling market control and a significant drop in trading activity.\n\nA look at AVAX’s six-month chart reveals a rollercoaster ride, characterized by sharp peaks and troughs. This volatility highlights AVAX’s susceptibility to broader market trends and its dependence on specific developments within its ecosystem.\n\nOver the past few months, AVAX has exhibited a pattern of price spikes followed by equally sharp corrections. Currently, the altcoin seems to be consolidating around the $38 mark after a recent dip from April’s highs.\n\nIf AVAX can maintain support around the crucial $35 level, there’s a possibility for a northward trajectory, especially if a broader bull run materializes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, significant resistance awaits at $48 and $53 – price points that AVAX has repeatedly tested and failed to surpass in recent months. A sustained breakout above these levels would signal a significant shift in momentum, potentially propelling AVAX towards the $80 or even $100 mark by the third quarter.\n\nThe trading scene surrounding AVAX presents a curious dichotomy. Coinglass data reveals a staggering 60% drop in trading volume, signifying a significant decline in market activity. This is further corroborated by a relatively balanced long/short ratio across various platforms, suggesting overall indecision among traders regarding AVAX’s future.\n\nHowever, a glimmer of bullish sentiment emerges from Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. Here, the long/short ratio skews considerably higher, indicating a potentially more optimistic outlook among individual traders on this specific platform.\n\nMeanwhile, with a 40% rating on the Fear and Greed Index, the current status of the AVAX market is characterized by neutral mood, indicating that investors have balanced opinions.\n\nAVAX’s struggles extend beyond trading. The altcoin seems to be loosening its grip on market share, with search interest also declining. This translates to a lack of market control and potentially waning general interest – not exactly the recipe for success for a token aiming for significant gains.\n\nFeatured image from Summitpost, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Things are moving fast in the crypto scene — now a new meta of Telegram clicker apps has appeared on the market, dwarfing the neverending multitude of the sophisticated capital-heavy DeFi and GameFi apps by attracting millions of users. MemeFi is at the forefront of the new narrative, with unexpected ties to Linea, an EVM chain, rather than TON, a native Telegram blockchain.\n\nMemeFi is an ecosystem featuring two mass-appeal apps: Web3 Social Tech game and a Telegram Clicker App. A simple clicker idle game has attracted more than 6.5M users, with DAU standing at an astonishing 1.5 million users.\n\nStill, MemeFi leads the way, firmly resting in the top 3. One important and a rather unique feature of the app is the gamification — a testament to sophistication in simplicity. While tapping, the user actually fights various cartoon-styled meme bosses and does damage to them. If the boss runs out of health, the player ascends to a new level, with a new boss unlocked and more coins to earn.\n\nThis does not exhaust the gaming aspect of the app, as players are limited in energy and may engage various boosters, as well as make upgrades in order to improve their experience.\n\nCoupled with a unique art style, created by a full-blown art studio who seem to know well the exoteric culture of crypto memes, the game is visually appealing and much more engaging than simpler clicker apps. It might be quite fair to say that social media abound in MemeFi-inspired videos and other types of content.\n\nWhen it comes to novelty, MemeFi Web3 app certainly has a lot to offer. The app is an idle game that comes with a spin: players unite in meme clans and fight ridiculous crypto-inspired bosses to earn rewards that other players can tap into via keys!\n\nKeys are a Social Tech feature introduced last summer, with the release of friend.tech, that represent players’ social capital. Since their prices are not directly set by supply and demand but rather change along a bonding curve through a liquidity pool mechanism, users are incentivized to behave in a competitive manner, speculating on key prices.\n\nMemeFi turned the bonding curve-powered asset into a sort of a bond, as players receive yield based on their share of another player’s key supply. This provides an economically-viable framework for keys that elevates them much higher than just a mere representation of social capital, which is, to say the least, quite an ethereal notion.\n\nThe new way “to do Social Tech” has attracted the attention of Linea, a leading player in the L2 sphere. With the MemeFi Web3 app launching on Linea, as well as social media activity, it is quite clear that the project has strong ties with the blockchain team. Even more obvious is that the Clicker App might have a bigger role to play in the development of the Linea ecosystem.\n\nThe immense potential and the number of clickers have been realized quickly by many in Web3. First leveraged by TON via Notcoin, along with top tier exchanges, including Binance, OKX and ByBit, the never-seen-before-in-crypto traffic is being channeled to their corresponding products.\n\nNow that TON has become too competitive of an environment for clickers, other blockchains might be looking at opportunities to grow their userbases tapping into these apps’ massive audiences. Linea seems to be a leader in this regard, becoming a close partner of one of the most used mass-appeal apps on Telegram.\n\nThis suggests Linea is highly motivated to provide full support to the MemeFi team, taking advantage of their success and upcoming listing. Now we are at a breakpoint where we might soon witness a mass conversion campaign of MemeFi users to Linea and the MemeFi Web3 app.\n\nWith clickers becoming the new narrative, MemeFi is one of the few apps that might attract a completely new audience to an EVM chain rather than TON — if successful, this will certainly threaten the current status-quo, where TON is able to monopolize the user base of Telegram, being closely associated with the social media giant.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Analysts from leading international cross-border bank, Standard Chartered have made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could witness a significant rise to new all-time highs above $73,700. This projection, slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an unexpected and wholly ambitious timeline.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research, Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In an email to TheBlock, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin is poised to break out of its previous all-time high on March 14, 2024, to witness a massive surge to approximately $73,798.\n\nThe analyst has projected a rather grandiose timeline for this bullish rally, expecting Bitcoin to hit the forecasted price target by the weekend. Kendrick attributed this potential price increase to the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEarlier on May 21, data from Farside investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had recorded their best inflow week in the last two months. The digital asset saw over $305.7 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), amassing the largest inflows of $290 million.\n\nCumulatively, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows of more than $13 billion from its launch on January 11 to the present. This increased demand and influx of capital which had been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March, could propel fresh surges for the cryptocurrency.\n\nKendrick has also disclosed that the possible approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The analyst has doubled down on his previous price prediction which anticipates Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and a whopping $200,000 increase in 2025.\n\nAs of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $70,013, reflecting a slight decline of 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady bullish momentum over the past week, experiencing consistent price surges, which have led to a sharp increase of 12.86%.\n\nPopular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has reported that Bitcoin is up more than 20% since its previous lows of $56,000 earlier this year. The approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could see the cryptocurrency’s price potentially rising more, following previous patterns when the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered a major price spike for the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nThis sentiment for a bullish breakout is shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has asserted that Bitcoin is currently showing a strong potential for further gains, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s robust price potential and strong fundamentals.\n\n",

    "content": "While top DeFi token, Solana, continues to recover in the broader market, SOL bulls are reeling with optimism, with many expecting the token to reach $200. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) has sparked excitement among traders and crypto enthusiasts after the announcement of its unique revenue-sharing model.\n\nRollblock’s emergence into the cryptocurrency market has sparked interest among traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Currently, in its presale’s second stage, Rollblock (RBLK) has demonstrated enormous potential, promising users and buyers incredible returns. Its ecosystem presents a roadmap unlike no other, gearing to change the narrative in the casino world.\n\nUnlike its traditional rivals, Rollblock offers a smooth sign-up process, prioritizing user privacy and convenience in today’s digital world. In addition, its incorporation of cryptocurrency as well as seamless onboarding process draws diverse users across the crypto market, especially with no need for KYC verification or extra downloads.\n\nFurthermore, Rollblock introduces a unique revenue-sharing model that could potentially change the dynamics in the GameFi market. While trying to repurchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, the Rollblock network sets aside up to 30% of its weekly revenue to achieve this. Furthermore, Rollblock’s token-burn feature ensures that 50% of repurchased tokens are removed from the market, while the other half goes to staking rewards.\n\nMeanwhile, the native RBLK token currently trades for $0.012 per token, which reflects 20% increase from an initial offering price of $0.01 as well as heightened buyer interes. As it awaits its listing on a major crypto exchange, market experts are touting Rollblock to soar to the top, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year.\n\nOne of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana (SOL) has proven time and again to be a formidable player in the crypto space. Notably, Solana is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve scalability concerns in the crypto market by introducing proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism.\n\nBesides its unique features, Solana has also demonstrated exceptional strength in the broader DeFi market. In the last year, Solana has surged over 760%, demonstrating its resilience despite the bear market. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $146.8 and $178.6, SOL token has shown signs of recovery with analysts projecting a resurgence for the token.\n\nFurthermore, Solana network’s success can be partly attributed to emergence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With tokens like Dogwifhat and Bonk taking centerstage, there has been a growing interest in the Solana network as a whole. Moreso, while this has spurred optimism, analysts are projecting Solana to soar and reach the $200 mark very soon. With its current mass adoption and growing market cap, Solana maintains a solid spot among top Defi tokens in the crypto market.\n\nRollblock’s ascent in the crypto market has been quite commendable, with the token exploding into the scene without much hassle. This is a result of its innovative features and distinct roadmap which give it an edge over other new tokens. With its current trajectory, market experts are touting it to mirror and surpass some of the top DeFi tokens in the market.\n\n",

    "content": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim, COO of the digital asset trading platform, Websea, where he shares his insights about web3 adoption.\n\nQ. Hello. Would you please introduce yourself and share your professional journey with our readers?\n\nHi, I’m Herbert and it’s wonderful to be here. I’m currently the COO of Websea, a youth-focused web3 digital asset trading platform.\n\nBefore Websea, I worked as the Global Operations Director at Huobi Global and Chief Marketing Officer at Cryptology Exchange. So I’ve been in operational management in the FinTech sector for a fairly long time.\n\nMost people know me as ‘The Bitcoin Man’ for my work as an angel investor and advisor for crypto projects. The Bitcoin Man is now a venture capital fund where I continue to invest and incubate promising startups.\n\nI’m also the founder of Crypto Chain University (CCU), a non-profit institute and digital repository for blockchain research and policy-oriented work. CCU is a passion project and comes from my desire to make web3 accessible to people.\n\nI believe the web3 sector has much to do to bring decentralized protocols to the masses. So I continue to work hard to realize the vision of ‘onboarding the next billion’ to crypto.\n\nQ. Why do you think the web3 industry hasn’t yet reached mass crypto adoption? What does the industry need to do to bring more people into web3?\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of easy-to-use, smooth, and efficient web3 protocols with an engaging user interface. We can’t expect newcomers to navigate complicated apps to store or use digital assets daily.\n\nSo web2 users need a seamless transition to web3 protocols where they don’t require any technical knowledge to operate the apps. Moreover, web3 apps must integrate attractive features and financial incentives to appeal to first-time users.\n\nFor instance, crypto exchanges function as the main gateway to enter web3 for investing and trading in crypto and NFTs. These exchanges serve as the primary circulation hubs for the digital asset economy to transact globally without any restrictions.\n\nHowever, most crypto exchanges have a difficult user interface that doesn’t appeal to new users. Thus we need more exchanges that can conveniently provide digital asset services and remain integrated with the wider web3 economy.\n\nOnce we have engaging web3 protocols, people from diverse demographics will start joining the crypto world.\n\nQ. Who do you think will be the primary driver of crypto adoption in the next decade? Can you elaborate on the reasons?\n\nI think the digital asset economy is conducive for people of all age groups and across geographical borders.\n\nIf you look at statistical reports, there has been an almost 200% growth in global crypto users with Asian and African countries dominating the Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nBut once you probe further, you’ll see that young people are the main drivers in the crypto space and will continue to do so.\n\nA Coinbase report states that 31% of young people own crypto compared to just 12% of older people. Further, 38% of youth believe that crypto is the future of finance compared to 28% of the older generation.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Millennials and Gen Z prefer crypto assets. To begin with, they’re digital natives who organically grew up with the Internet. But other socio-economic factors are working as well.\n\nMillennials have faced student debts, rising housing costs, inflation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, rather than trusting centralized banks or government-backed national currencies, they’re more open to alternative finance like crypto.\n\nThe Great Wealth Transfer will happen over the next few decades where Millennials and Gen Z will inherit around $84 trillion. A Galaxy Research report states that $160-$225 billion would come into crypto markets from younger generations if the Wealth Transfer happened today.\n\nWhen the Transfer is complete by 2045, crypto can record a daily incremental buying pressure of around $20-$28 million.\n\nThat is why I’m building Websea, a digital asset ecosystem that specifically focuses on young investors.\n\nQ. Tell us more about Websea. How do you intend to cater to a young audience with your platform?\n\nWebsea is a digital asset trading platform exclusively customized for the global youth.\n\nOur platform offers a dual account system with centralized and decentralized asset custody models. We have an integrated AI system for risk mitigation, fraud prevention, predictive trading analytics, and strategy recommendations.\n\nThe WBS token powers our Websea platform. WBS has a total supply of 300 million tokens with 60% allocated for community incentives. The rest is for long-term platform development with a multi-year lock-up period.\n\nWe follow an X-To-Earn tokenomics model where users can play, trade, browse, stake, contribute, and create to earn tokens.\n\nTo answer your second question, Websea offers gamified features for an engaging and entertaining trading experience for our young audience.\n\nWe also have options like Boost to Bargain, Invitation Red Packet rewards, Lucky Box awards, and Group Boosts. These financial incentives help us consolidate our platform and organically expand our user base.\n\nWebsea is also focussing on building a gaming ecosystem to cater to the youth and will incubate GameFi projects.\n\nQ. We’re currently going through a bull market where hype and speculation dominate crypto trading. However, the bear market brings a huge slump. So what do you think about this cycle and its impact on the crypto trading industry? How do you think the youth will shape this space in the coming years?\n\nI consider that the bull market hype brings new investors to the crypto industry. So there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with speculative trading during a bull run. Plus, the stock market also goes through cycles so it’s only natural for the crypto market to go through the same.\n\nLet me explain this with an example. The Runes hype has brought huge attention to Bitcoin and will provide an impetus to Bitcoin DeFi in the long run. However, as of April, two-thirds of the top 50 Runes are in the red, which means investors are not seeing any immediate profits.\n\nPeople usually blame young investors for having fun with memecoins and making the crypto space akin to gambling. But even Vitalik Buterin thinks such practices are not entirely bad.\n\nHe recently said, “If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version…?”\n\nI’ll echo Buterin’s statement and say that young investors know what they’re doing and how they want to manage their finances. So even if they’re having fun with meme coins or investing seriously in BTC or ETH, they know the game.\n\nThat is why I think the youth will drive global crypto adoption and make the web3 space more valuable and utility-driven in the future.\n\n\n\nImage: Websea Medium Blog\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin whales have continued to show their resilience and unwavering bullishness on the flagship crypto as it retraces.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin whales have continued to show their resilience and unwavering bullishness on the flagship crypto. This category of investors has accumulated a significant amount of the crypto token in the last seven days amid heightened volatility in Bitcoin’s price.\n\nData from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have combined to accumulate 20,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) over the past seven days. This accumulation coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price surge above $70,000.\n\nFurthermore, these whales’ purchases suggest that volume is picking up for the flagship crypto, which could help trigger more price rallies. Moreover, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in a recent market report that the selling pressure on Bitcoin was declining. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price looks primed to take off sooner rather than later with significant buys like the one made by these whales.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional investors are also back in the fold and look to be doubling their bets on the flagship crypto. This is evident in the fact that inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have picked up over the last two weeks. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds have taken in almost $800 million in this week alone.\n\nCrypto analyst James Check (also known as Checkmatey) noted in a recent market report that these funds could lead the next wave of demand, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high (ATH). These Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already been instrumental to Bitcoin’s growth this year, with the flagship crypto hitting its current ATH of $73,750 earlier in March.\n\nLike Check, crypto analyst Gustavo Faria also noted in a recent blog post that there are signs that a new wave of demand is emerging. This has raised the possibility of the next rally happening even sooner than expected. Crypto analysts like BitQuant have provided insights into how high Bitcoin could rise on its next leg up, predicting that the crypto token will reach $95,000.\n\nOn-chain analytics platform Santiment suggested there was no need to worry about any price correction for Bitcoin as the bulls have enough capital to buy up these dips. The platform highlighted that the amount of non-empty stablecoin wallets is rising, indicating that more whales are loading up their bags to invest in the crypto market.\n\nSpecifically, USDC non-empty wallets have grown by over 13%, and Tether non-empty wallets have grown by over 15%. This figure is expected to keep rising as the bull run progresses later in the year.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\n",

    "content": "It’s not often that there’s a “best” educational resource for any particular subject. But if there’s one resource that Web3 developers point to, it’s former Chainlink Labs Developer Advocate Patrick Collin’s ultimate tutorials. They’re standout resources that have empowered countless developers to learn blockchains, learn Solidity, and dive deep into Web3 development.\n\nDepending on the edition, these videos can range from anywhere between 16 hours and 32 hours. They’re meant to be watched and rewatched over months and years, rather than seconds and minutes. While this can be a large time investment, there’s likely no better way to start learning how to code in Web3.\n\nIn this blog, we break down Patrick’s most recent tutorial—a three-part, ~27-hour step-by-step tutorial focused on the Foundry development toolkit—so students can understand exactly what they’ll learn by reading below.\n\nWeb3 development moves fast—it’s important to learn from up-to-date resources. This video currently represents one of the most recent and comprehensive Web3 courses that exist today.\n\nImportant Links:The Solidity Handbook by Chainlink Labs Developer Advocate Zubin Pratap is an all-in-one resource for when you need a quick refresher on Solidity concepts.\n\nIn the first lesson, Patrick provides the context needed to understand the layers of the Web3 tech stack. From industry terminology like “dApp” and “smart contract” to blockchain basics such as hashes, gas fees, and block headers, this lesson provides the background necessary to understand what’s unique about Web3 development.\n\nThis lesson introduces Remix, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Solidity smart contracts. In just a few hours, Patrick provides a step-by-step walkthrough of basic Solidity concepts such as types, functions, arrays, mappings, and structs. Additionally, he outlines core development concepts such as memory, storage, and calldata.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will have set up their first smart contract and gained a basic understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)—a good first step for moving on to more complex and advanced contracts.\n\nIn this lesson, students will begin experimenting with more advanced coding concepts in Remix.\n\nMost decentralized applications today are built as a collection of smart contracts that all work together to create a unified application. This lesson teaches you how to create multiple smart contracts that interact with each other in a logical and efficient way. It also introduces one of the most important concepts not only in Web3 development but in computer science at large: Inheritance.\n\nIn the fourth lesson of this free blockchain course, students learn how to create a crowdfunding application through two different smart contracts: FundMe.sol and PriceConverter.sol.\n\nBy following along with and completing this demo application, students learn the basic keywords needed to securely send ether through a function and how to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds—the best-in-class price oracle solution for DeFi—to create price conversions. The lesson introduces both general and Solidity-specifc concepts such as loops, constructors, modifiers, immutability, constants, fallbacks, and interfaces.\n\nThis lesson focuses on enhancing your learning experience by providing tips for supercharging your learning experience, tips and tricks for setting up a GitHub and correctly formatting questions for the best results, and working with AI tools that can 10X learning and performance.\n\nStudents will also be introduced to SpeedRunEthereum, a platform designed to assist in their learning journey.\n\nLesson six of this blockchain course for beginners moves students from Remix to Foundry—an Ethereum developer toolkit written in the Rust programming language.\n\nPatrick provides step-by-step instructions on the installation and setup, with separate instructions for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, and introduces Gitpod as a tool for local development. Once everything is set up, students will learn how to work with the VSCode editor and frameworks such as ThirdWeb and Alchemy, as well as tools for deploying to local chains.\n\nLesson seven dives deeper into Foundry, with students learning how to test in a blockchain environment—including setup, debugging, and coverage.\n\nSpecifically, Patrick outlines how to better manage gas in the context of storage and withdrawals for smart contracts, walks through the process of testing and debugging code, and introduces advanced deploy scripts, refactoring, and magic numbers. Additionally, students will learn the logistical process needed to push code to GitHub—one of the most basic skills needed to work as a professional developer alongside a larger team.\n\nThis lesson provides a quick full-stack/front-end tutorial for creating a blockchain application using HTML and JavaScript.\n\nThrough this lesson, students will understand how the Metamask wallet works with their browser and get introduced to function selectors, which are crucial for interacting with smart contracts.\n\nIn lesson nine of this blockchain course, students will build a smart contract raffle demo using Foundry. They’ll learn how to set up a “Raffle.sol” contract that uses Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Automation to generate a random number that’s used to pick the raffle winner.\n\nBy building this smart contract application with the help of Patrick’s step-by-step tutorial, students will learn about custom errors, events, and block.timestamp, how to generate random numbers on-chain using Chainlink VRF, and how to automate smart contract functions using Chainlink Automation.\n\nThis lesson covers everything ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment). By the end of this lesson, students will understand what an ERC, EIP, and ERC-20 are in a technical sense by following a series of steps.\n\nFirst, they’ll learn how to manually create an ERC-20 token, including the information needed to deeply understand the token standard. Then, students will learn how to use OpenZeppelin templates to create tokens (OpenZeppelin is a popular library for secure contract implementations) and then deploy their tokens on a testnet.\n\nAdditionally, students will learn how to build AI tests, which can streamline the process of testing blockchain applications.\n\nThis lesson introduces non-fungible tokens (NFTs), also known as the ERC-721 token standard.\n\nBy following along with Patrick in this lesson, students will learn what an NFT is, how to create an NFT smart contract, how to use decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS or create NFT images using SVG, and how to directly encode function calls.\n\nLesson 12 delves into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), from stablecoins and lending to auditing, fuzz testing, and more. In the pinnacle lesson of this tutorial, students will get an overview of the DeFi ecosystem, learn about one of the most prominent token types (stablecoins), and walk step-by-step through the code needed to build a decentralized stablecoin.\n\nThis lesson also instructs students on how to work with DeFi protocols such as Aave’s lending protocol, which naturally covers concepts such as collateral, mints, price oracles, and liquidations. And because DeFi applications must make security their top priority, Patrick introduces one of the best testing techniques in Web3—fuzz testing.\n\nThis lesson provides an introduction to upgradeable smart contracts, which are how Web3 developers securely add functionality to immutable contracts.\n\nPatrick summarizes the different types of upgrade techniques, introduces delegate calls, and compares universal upgradable smart contract proxies (UUPS) to transparent proxy patterns.\n\nIn lesson 14, students will learn about another core Web3 concept—decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are tools used for governing decentralized applications.\n\nPatrick not only explains what a DAO is at a fundamental level, but also provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up a DAO by creating a governance token and smart contract and running tests for your DAO smart contract to ensure correct functionality and execution.\n\nThe final lesson of the 27-hour development tutorial focuses on smart contract security and auditing.\n\nStudents will learn about the importance of smart contract audits, the process of manual review, and various tools and techniques used in the auditing process, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and fuzzing.\n\nAs one of the best blockchain courses on the Internet today, Patrick’s 27-hour Foundry tutorial is a great starting point for anyone aiming to break into Web3 development, whether that means learning to code for the first time or transitioning skills from Web2.\n\nBecause there’s massive demand for smart contract developers and a relatively small talent pool, there’s heaps of opportunity available for those with the tenacity, will, and dedication to complete this 27-hour-long free blockchain course. There’s no better time to get started than right now.\n\nStart learning today.\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Discover three ways to increase transparency and mitigate risk around token bridges to help protect end users.\n\n",
    "content": "Driven by the demand for a more holistic Web3 user experience, cross-chain bridges are used to transfer digital assets from one blockchain network to another through wrapped tokens—one-to-one digital representations of tokens from another blockchain. They’re needed because blockchains are generally not interoperable by default. Wrapped tokens unlock cross-chain liquidity, but often require additional trust assumptions compared to assets native to a single blockchain.\n\nCross-chain token bridges face an array of security challenges, from securing private keys to ensuring airtight smart contract code. Developers must take a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach to cross-chain bridge architecture, with independent layers of security at every step, from technical to social.\n\nCross-chain bridge security shouldn’t just be reactive; it should proactively account for the possibilities of an attack or exploit and protect against the potential outcomes. The key question is: What do you do when a carefully laid security plan goes awry?Regardless of how a bridge is compromised, there are often two immediate risks that come from bridge attacks and exploits.\n\nUser funds on the source blockchain are stolen and corresponding wrapped tokens are no longer fully backed. Because wrapped assets only hold value due to their cross-chain backing, stealing locked assets on the source blockchain effectively makes corresponding wrapped assets worthless.\n\nKnown as an “infinite mint” exploit, this is when an excess of wrapped tokens without sufficient reserves are minted, meaning they are no longer sufficiently collateralized. Infinite mint exploits lead to fractional reserve practices, and malicious actors can take advantage of this by either selling the wrapped token assets on a decentralized exchange or using the tokens as collateral on a lending market.\n\nA compromised cross-chain token bridge poses an immediate risk not only to bridge users but also to any project that directly integrates support for the wrapped token. Wrapped tokens are often used within DeFi protocols, and an exploit or hack can significantly impact operations and sometimes lead to protocol insolvency.\n\nFor example, using wrapped tokens as collateral within a pooled DeFi lending market can put users at risk, even if they only lend or borrow network-native assets. If a wrapped token used as collateral is exploited, it can result in the loss of lender (or protocol) funds, leading to insolvencies that can not only impact users, but cause ripple effects across the wider ecosystem.\n\nAs cross-chain token bridges and their wrapped tokens gain adoption, the ecosystem risk, if a bridge’s security is compromised, grows.\n\nChainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) provides smart contracts with the information needed to calculate the true collateralization of any cross-chain reserves backing wrapped tokens. Operated by a decentralized network of oracles, Chainlink Proof of Reserve verifies cross-chain collateral—acting as a data layer for a wrapped token bridge.\n\nNote: Chainlink PoR increases transparency into the reserves backing wrapped tokens, and can be used for additional safeguard features, but doesn’t prevent a cross-chain bridge from being drained due to an exploit. Rather, PoR can be used by bridges and dApps to help mitigate the impact of such events.\n\nThere are 3 main benefits to using Chainlink Proof of Reserve for wrapped tokens.\n\nA robust and decentralized reserve data feed gives bridge developers the tools to build automatic fail-safe measures that can halt the minting, redeeming, and burning of a wrapped token. For example, one way to help protect against infinite mint attacks is to use Chainlink Proof of Reserve data feeds to check if there is an equal or greater amount of reserves than wrapped tokens. If there aren’t, the minting of additional wrapped tokens is reverted.\n\nBecause on-chain reserve data from Chainlink Proof of Reserve can help serve as a critical fail-safe in case of a bridge exploit or hack, it’s important that data feeds are secure, reliable, and accurate even in outlier circumstances.\n\nBy leveraging a decentralized, Sybil-resistant network of nodes run by proven node operators, Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides best-in-class cross-chain reserve verification services, with updates reliably posted on-chain regardless of market or network conditions.\n\nRobust on-chain proof of reserves surrounding wrapped tokens through Chainlink PoR enables DeFi developers to build in protections against potential bridge hacks or exploits. This helps mitigate DeFi contagion risk, and as more DeFi protocols implement these failsafe measures, ecosystem resiliency and anti-reflexivity will grow.\n\nFor example, DeFi lending protocols could add circuit breakers that automatically pause lending pools using wrapped assets as collateral by reading data from Chainlink PoR data feeds. If there aren’t enough reserves locked on the source blockchain, the DeFi lending protocol can then automatically halt operations to reduce the severity of the event.\n\nA good proof of reserves solution for wrapped token assets makes it easy for DeFi developers to leverage the data for this exact reason. To lower the bar for implementations, reserve data feeds should be simple to implement, use a standardized solution, and be posted natively on-chain.\n\nAs the industry-standard oracle solution for DeFi protocols, with over five billion data points delivered to blockchains, Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables DeFi developers to easily integrate reserve data into their dApp in just three steps.\n\nAutomating data delivery on cross-chain reserves enables users to seamlessly verify the collateral backing of a wrapped token and quickly make informed decisions during outlier events—a key competitive edge for wrapped asset issuers looking to gain user adoption. Without proof of reserves, it can be difficult for users to verify on-chain that wrapped assets correspond on a one-to-one basis with assets on the source blockchain.\n\nOne key consideration is that exploits or hacks can happen quickly. Reserve data feeds should be designed to update on-chain in near real-time to give users maximum transparency into the state of the cross-chain bridge, particularly when it’s most needed.\n\nThat’s why Chainlink Proof of Reserve checks token reserves off-chain at regular intervals and updates the reserve data on-chain when it reaches a deviation threshold or heartbeat trigger, helping ensure real-time updates during unexpected events while saving on gas costs when reserves remain stable.\n\nBringing reserve data to blockchains provides crucial protection for cross-chain token bridges by enabling anyone to independently verify the collateral backing a wrapped token and projects to integrate automate failsafes in the event of a hack or exploit.\n\nTo find out more about how you can use Chainlink to help ensure the security of your wrapped token asset or DeFi protocol, reach out to our experts.\n\n",

This creates a problem for many dApps that require their smart contracts to execute at regular time intervals (e.g. every 24 hours), when predefined conditions are met (e.g. Ethereum hitting a specific price), or following a computation (e.g. a loan is calculated to be undercollateralized).\n\nIn the past, developers would solve this problem by creating and maintaining their own centralized scripts to trigger their smart contracts, or trigger them manually. However, this effectively undermines the purpose of building a decentralized blockchain application, and opens up the possibility of downtime if the centralized script or manual triggering process fails.\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn how to use Chainlink Automation to trigger smart contract execution in a reliable, automatic, and decentralized manner.\n\nChainlink Automation unlocks a new way to trigger smart contract execution in a decentralized manner, enabling developers to transform the way they build and maintain dApps. There are three main benefits to decentralized smart contact automation.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to remove any centralized points of failure in your operations. Chainlink Automation is powered by a decentralized network of nodes—the same hyper-reliable nodes that currently secure tens of billions in value across DeFi via Chainlink Data Feeds—removing centralized points of failure.\n\nSecondly, rather than investing time and resources in creating scripts for on-chain monitoring and triggering smart contract execution, developers can plug into Chainlink Automation’s optimized infrastructure by simply creating an Automation-compatible contract and registering it. This saves time, reduces the DevOps workload, and allows developers to focus on writing more great code.\n\nLastly, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can enhance the security of their protocol. Developers no longer have to risk exposing their own private key when initiating transactions from centralized servers—the nodes on the Chainlink Automation Network will sign on-chain transactions.\n\nYou can automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation in two steps:After these steps have been completed, Chainlink Automation will perform the Upkeep job as specified without any further input.\n\nIf you are new to Solidity, we recommend following some of the beginner tutorials before continuing. This tutorial is particularly comprehensive and useful. We will now show you how to make your contract Automation-compatible. If you prefer watching a video on the topic please watch our video tutorial.\n\nTo create an automated trigger for smart contract execution, you need to write an Automation-compatible smart contract. Automation-compatible contracts have a checkUpkeep function and a performUpkeep function with the required inputs and outputs expected by Chainlink Automation. To help prevent errors we will use the Automation-compatible interface before we specify what our check and perform functions should do.\n\nStart by importing the KeeperCompatibleInterface into your contract.\n\nThere are two functions to this interface:Chainlink Automation uses a decentralized network to monitor the checkUpkeep function securely and cost-efficiently off-chain during every block and then initiates an on-chain transaction to execute the smart contract function when predefined conditions are met.\n\nThe checkUpkeep function takes a bytes parameter named checkData that is set when you register your Upkeep on the Automation app. This value is optional and can be used in your logic to determine if checkUpkeep returns true.\n\ncheckUpkeep returns a bool called upkeepNeeded. When true, this will call performUpkeep. It also returns performData in Bytes format (optional additional data) that the Automation Node should call performUpkeep with if Upkeep is needed. For more information, see the Developer Documentation.\n\nIf the off-chain simulation of your checkUpkeep confirms your predefined conditions are met (upkeepNeeded \u003d\u003d true from checkUpkeep), the Automation Node will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain executing the performUpkeep with performData as an input.\n\nA rotating node selection process prevents gas price auction wars between nodes and stabilizes costs of automating your contracts.\n\nHere is an example contract snippet from Chainlink Automation user Entropyfi where checkUpkeep checks whether the Entropyfi prediction game is due for settlement.\n\nChainlink Automation Nodes will constantly call the checkUpkeep function, and if the upkeepNeeded is evaluated to true, then the nodes will execute the performUpkeep function.\n\nWhether you are creating a new contract or already have a contract deployed that contains a function that needs to be automated there are guides to help you get started in the Chainlink Automation Developer Documentation.\n\nStart with the example contract here. The example below represents a simple counter contract.\n\nChainlink Automation can monitor the state of any on-chain or off-chain condition, such as the passage of time (e.g. did 24 hours pass?) or a computation (e.g. is the loan calculated to be undercollateralized?). Once a condition is met, Automation nodes submit a transaction on-chain to trigger the smart contract to execute.\n\nYou can also start with a Chainlink Automation utility contract such as the EthBalanceMonitor contract or these examples.\n\nOnce you have your Automation-compatible contract, head over to the Chainlink Automation app and click “Register new Upkeep”.\n\nFor a detailed step-by-step guide on how to register, see the Chainlink Developer Documentation.\n\nImportant note (for non-ETH chains): your Upkeep must be funded with ERC-677 LINK (not ERC-20, which is common across many token bridges). Use PegSwap to make your LINK tokens ERC-677 compatible.\n\nOnce registered and approved, you can add additional funds and see all the details for your Upkeep on the Chainlink Automation app.\n\nNow that you know how easy it is to automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation, you can get started with integrating Chainlink Automation and unlock a huge range of use cases, such as DEX limit orders, cross-chain NFT minting, rebasing and rebalancing tokens, and much more.\n\nLearn more by visiting the developer documentation and joining the technical discussion in Discord.

    "summary": "Blockchains are a radical new computing model, but their trust model is often misunderstood. This article aims to explore the crucial role of full nodes.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchains are a radical new computing model where data and applications are secured not by centralized intermediaries but by a decentralized network of computers. Due to their permissionless nature, blockchains enable anyone to opt-in and begin independently verifying the integrity of computations, resulting in a checks and balances system between users and network operators.\n\nFrom the creation of new digital currencies with programmatic monetary policies (e.g. Bitcoin) to the execution of programmable trust-minimized applications (e.g. Ethereum), blockchains are rapidly entering the public consciousness as a new form of digital infrastructure, often referred to as Web3. However, while the overarching value proposition of blockchains is recognized by many, the nuances regarding the underlying trust model of blockchains are often misunderstood.\n\nThis article will serve to explain how the trust model of blockchains differs from traditional computing by looking at the role of self-verifying full nodes, with particular reference to how they keep block producers (e.g. miners/validators) accountable and how decreasing the cost of verification is at the heart of blockchain scalability.\n\nThe computing model used by most applications today involves a client-server model where requests are sent to a centralized database server. The participants within the traditional computing model can be broken down into the following:Often referred to as “Web2,” this computing model empowers developers to quickly launch and scale applications on-demand. Users are also provided with a seamless user experience due to low-latency and high-throughput computation facilitated by data centers. While applications hosted on centralized databases provide immense value to billions of users around the world, they carry certain limitations.\n\nMost notably, end-users have no way to verify that the computation involved in producing a response to a request is legitimate or that the database entries have not been manipulated over time. Such applications effectively operate in a black box, meaning users must fully trust that third-party intermediates will act in their best interests.\n\nThe trust assumptions associated with centrally hosted applications can negatively impact users, who can experience financial censorship, social media deplatforming, leaks of their personal data, manipulative content selection algorithms, increased reconciliation costs, corrupted data and data loss, and an overall lack of accountability. The end result is a breakdown in societal trust and an increase in the cost of economic coordination.\n\nRather than trusting the good faith of centralized intermediaries, blockchains introduce trust-minimization and credible neutrality by using:Importantly, blockchains are open networks—anyone in the world can join as either an active contributor or a passive listener. This allows end-users to verify for themselves that any output produced by the network is valid and that ledger entries have not been tampered with. The transparency of blockchains also mitigates risks around opacity, eliminating information asymmetry and ensuring information regarding risk exposure is available to all participants.\n\nTo ensure the proper operation of a blockchain, there are various (often overlapping) categories of network participants that each play a crucial role.\n\nWhile each of these network participants plays a key role in blockchain ecosystems, full nodes operate at the heart of a blockchain network as they are the entities responsible for maintaining full replicas of the network’s ledger. Other network participants, such as block producers and light clients, connect to full nodes to stay informed on the state of the network. The resulting network topography is illustrated below.\n\nA common misconception about blockchains is that since block producers are responsible for generating new blocks containing transactions, then they must unilaterally control a blockchain. Put another way, the belief is that if a majority of BPs are corrupted/colluding (commonly known as a 51% attack), then the network is wholly compromised and everything of value can be irrevocably destroyed. In reality, BPs have a limited scope of power, where only specific types of malicious activity can take place.\n\nWhat block producers can do:What block producers cannot do:To understand why the power of BPs is inherently limited, it is important to understand the relationship between BPs and self-verifying full nodes.\n\nWhile BPs ensure the liveness of a blockchain by proposing new blocks, they do not determine the validity of blocks on behalf of the network. Rather, it is the role of full nodes—which store a personal copy of the blockchain’s ledger—to independently validate each block and execute all the transactions contained within to determine whether the protocol’s rules are being followed.\n\nThe result is a checks and balances system where full nodes hold BPs accountable by only accepting valid blocks and ignoring blocks that do not conform to the protocol rules. As such, BPs are economically incentivized to only produce valid blocks, as otherwise they would waste economic resources by producing invalid blocks and forfeit any block reward and transaction fees they could have earned. Even if other BPs build valid blocks on top of an invalid block, these blocks will all be ignored by full nodes, resulting in such BPs effectively forking themselves off the network.\n\nFull nodes are operated by key economic actors within a blockchain’s ecosystem, including cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoin issuers, oracles, layer-2 validators, RPC providers, custody wallet providers, large crypto asset holders, and average users alike. By self-verifying a blockchain’s ledger, these key economic actors cannot be tricked into accepting invalid blocks. Full nodes do not need to coordinate/communicate with each other to determine if a block is valid either. Rather, by following the protocol’s rules when checking blocks, they will all arrive at the same conclusion regarding block validity.\n\nWith many blockchains, the protocol rules are determined by the community off-chain in a process known as social consensus. This typically involves a formalized process (e.g. Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs), where the community debates the merits of any protocol rule change on various social channels. Once rough off-chain consensus is achieved, blockchain core developers write a new version of the blockchain software client, which implements these changes. Full nodes and BPs can then choose whether or not to run this new software to upgrade the network via a hard fork (non-backward-compatible change) or a soft fork (backward-compatible change).\n\nIf a hard fork upgrade is contentious, then the network may experience a chain split where two different versions of a blockchain are created and individually maintained. Once a split occurs, each blockchain will have a shared history from the genesis block up to the specific block height at which the split occurred. This was seen with the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, when differences arose on how to scale transaction throughput. It was also seen in the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic hard fork in 2016, when differences arose on how to handle The DAO hack.\n\nIn contrast to off-chain consensus, other blockchains have chosen to handle upgrades via on-chain governance, with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by token-holders determining protocol rule changes. Either method of facilitating protocol upgrades presents its own unique benefits and challenges, and the method used depends on the needs of the community.\n\nIf the hardware requirements for operating a full node are too high (e.g. non-consumer hardware is required), then fewer entities will be capable of or willing to run a full node, instead, relying on centralized solutions to read/write to the blockchain. This can result in a blockchain network becoming more vulnerable to exploitation from BPs.\n\nTo support a healthy network of full nodes, many blockchains purposely limit the transaction throughput of the network to that of the lowest spec computer that the community desires to self-verify the ledger. Low hardware requirements not only help those who wish to run a full node during normal operations, but also make it easier to spin up a new self-verifying full node if the blockchain is actively being attacked by a colluding group of BPs. The exact hardware requirements necessary to stay fully synchronized to the network vary from blockchain to blockchain, however, a common target goal is average consumer hardware.\n\nThe following logic describes how low hardware requirements lead to the core value proposition of blockchains:Low hardware requirements → low cost to verify blocks → more entities can run full nodes → stronger resistance to BP attacks → increased network security → superior credible neutrality → increased adoptionWhile the minimum hardware requirements capable of running a full node are not explicitly defined in the rules of a blockchain protocol (improvements in hardware/software efficiency is perpetually occurring), the transaction throughput rules of a blockchain (commonly determined by the size and frequency of blocks) are tuned to target a specific range of device specifications.\n\nAlthough targeting average consumer hardware is a common approach, some blockchains opt to target beefier server-grade hardware as the minimum hardware requirements for verification in order to increase transaction throughput. This comes with the acknowledgment that while fewer entities may be able to self-verify the ledger using self-hosted equipment, a sufficient number of key economic actors may still have the resources necessary to run a full node.\n\nEveryone in the world running their own full node to self-verify a blockchain is an idealistic goal. However, in practice, the time and resources required to spin up a full node may introduce too much friction for many end-users. As blockchains become more widely adopted, users familiar with trusting centralized service providers may find the process of setting up a full node too cumbersome, and would rather be able to immediately start interacting with on-chain applications.\n\nAs a result, most end-users of widely used blockchains today do not run their own full node, but rather connect to and implicitly trust RPC providers to relay transactions to the network and inform them on the current state of a blockchain. Such users may not enjoy the full self-verification benefits of blockchains and the security of the network is not as strong as it could be, however, it is still an order of magnitude improvement in trust-minimization over traditional computing models.\n\nA middle-ground solution to this problem could entail the integration of light clients into blockchain wallets. While this would be an improvement over the status quo by reducing trust in RPC providers, light clients still implicitly trust that the majority of BPs are producing valid blocks and that all of the transaction data within a block has been made publicly available.\n\nIn order for light clients to verify the work of BPs without simply downloading and executing the entire block (i.e. running a full node), technical improvements in light client implementations can increase their trust-minimization properties, resulting in what can be considered “trust-minimized light clients”. These technical improvements can include:As additional trust-minimization techniques are created and deployed successfully in production, the cost and friction of verifying the work of block producers without downloading and executing entire blocks improve, leading to more secure blockchain networks. Notably, the methods of creating trust-minimized light clients can even enable more scalable blockchain networks to emerge.\n\nScaling a blockchain is commonly thought of as being equivalent to increasing transaction throughput. However, a more holistic interpretation would be increasing transaction throughput while maintaining a low verification cost. Thanks to the properties of trust-minimized light clients, the throughput of a blockchain network can be increased (e.g. increasing block size and/or block interval time) yet still retain the low verification costs required to keep BPs accountable.\n\nFurthermore, layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups leverage similar techniques as trust-minimized light clients by using cryptographic proofs to prove transaction validity without the blockchain network needing to execute every transaction. In this case, the blockchain operates an enshrined trust-minimized light client for the layer-2 rollup. Combined with transaction batching and storage of transaction data on-chain for data availability, transaction throughput can be increased by multiple orders of magnitude with minimal to no additional verification costs imposed on the underlying blockchain.\n\nBlockchain are highly secure, credibly neutral, and transparent append-only ledgers that offer a new paradigm for computing. By incorporating a checks and balances system between block producers and full nodes, a blockchain can serve the needs of its community and evolve over time while also remaining resistant to manipulation. While more work needs to be done to lower verification costs, blockchains in their current state still offer an order of magnitude increase in trust-minimization over traditional computing models.\n\n—The opinions expressed within this post are solely the author’s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Chainlink is a highly flexible oracle framework that provides developers the tools required to build a wide range of smart contract applications.\n\n",
    "content": "Fundamentally, contracts define the terms and obligations for an exchange of value between two or more independent parties. Historically, a centralized arbitrator is usually required to verify if those terms and conditions are met. However, thanks to the advent of blockchain technology and smart contract applications, we can now replace centralized arbitrators with decentralized infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, due to the consensus mechanisms of blockchains, smart contracts have no built-in capabilities for interacting with external resources like data providers and API services as a means of verifying the outcome of real-world events happening outside the blockchain. This creates what is known as the blockchain oracle problem and represents one of the greatest limitations to representing everyday contracts on the blockchain.\n\nTo overcome this lack of connectivity, hybrid smart contracts use oracles as middleware to retrieve external data inputs, push data outputs to external systems, and perform scalable off-chain computations. Not only do oracles serve as a two-way bridge between smart contracts and the outside world, but they also provide a security framework for protecting against any single point of failure such as data manipulation and downtime.\n\nChainlink is the most widely used decentralized oracle network, currently securing tens of billions in USD value for live applications across numerous blockchains and use cases. Chainlink is not a single oracle network but an ecosystem consisting of numerous decentralized oracle networks running in parallel. Each oracle network can provide a multitude of oracle services without cross dependencies on other oracle networks, some of which include:Ultimately, Chainlink provides the necessary developer tools required to construct any type of oracle network, such as using multiple data sources, multiple oracle nodes, various aggregation methods, payment penalties, reputation services, and visualization tools. This allows for a wide range of use cases to be developed, tested, and pushed into production.\n\nAccess to external data opens up a whole new wave of functionality for smart contracts. To inspire you with the limitless potential of universally connected smart contracts, we put together a list of 77+ ways to use the Chainlink Network. If any of these ideas resonate with you or if you want to learn more, find us on Discord or Github, and check out our documentation to begin building universally connected smart contracts today.\n\nMoney is the common medium used today to value and exchange assets. Financial products provide different vehicles in which people can maximize the value of their money via different strategies like hedging, speculating, earning interest, collateralizing loans, and more. However, traditional finance is often gated, wherein well-capitalized entities have disproportionate control over the issuance of money and the creation/offering and settlement of financial products. The result is a lack of universal accessibility to certain financial products and the introduction of counterparty risk, where the larger entity has more influence on whether the financial product is fairly honored according to the pre-agreed upon terms.\n\nBlockchains and smart contracts bring deterministic execution to financial products, eliminate moats around financial product creation, and provide tamper-proof monetary policy for on-chain assets. Chainlink oracles play a critical role in creating advanced smart contracts representing financial products and monetary instruments, particularly those that execute based on market data like FX rates, interest rates, asset prices, indices, and more.\n\nBlockchain-based money markets are crucial financial infrastructure that use smart contracts to connect lenders, who wish to earn yield on their assets, with borrowers, who wish to gain access to working capital. They allow users to increase the utility of their crypto holdings and participate in both the supply side and the demand side. However, to ensure the solvency of the platform, price feeds are required to track the valuation of assets used on the platform as a means of ensuring loans are issued at fair market prices and liquidations automatically occur on undercollateralized loans.\n\nAave, Compound, and Liquity are examples of on-chain money markets protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch market data for dozens of different on-chain cryptocurrencies. With this real-time pricing data, these lending/borrowing protocols can calculate the valuation of each user’s collateral and debt in order to determine when liquidations should be initiated. This ensures the money market protocols are always sufficiently collateralized, protecting tens of billions of USD value in user deposits.\n\nStablecoins are on-chain tokens that are pegged 1:1 to fiat currency, commonly the US dollar. They provide users with the ability to hold a non-volatile cryptocurrency. While centralized stablecoins are backed by fiat in an off-chain bank account, decentralized stablecoins are commonly overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrencies and require price data to maintain full collateralization (e.g. a user’s collateral is worth over 150% the value of their loan).\n\nDeFiDollar is an example of a decentralized meta-stablecoin (a stablecoin backed by multiple stablecoins) that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of the underlying assets including sUSD, USDT, DAI, and USDC. In the event that one or multiple of these tokens deviate from their 1:1 USD peg, thus causing DUSD to also lose its peg, a rebalance is triggered between the four reserves in order to preserve the dollar parity of DUSD.\n\nSimilar to centralized stablecoins collateralized by dollars in a bank account or decentralized stablecoins overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrency, algorithmic stablecoins aim to maintain a peg equivalent to another currency like USD. However, unlike other implementations, algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg using automated rewards and penalties to drive the price towards the peg, often by burning the stablecoin when under its peg (deflation) and minting more stablecoins when over its peg (inflation).\n\nFei Protocol is an example of an algorithmic stablecoin that uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the reference to set the protocol-controlled value bonding curve for the FEI/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap to stabilize the peg of the FEI token. Through the market-wide pricing provided by the ETH/USD Price Feed, Fei Protocol can ensure the proper exchange rate is offered by the bonding curve.\n\nFutures are financial instruments that “obligate” traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Commonly used for hedging and leveraged exposure, futures smart contracts require users to collateralize their long or short position. Price feeds are used to determine whether or not liquidations should occur, ensuring each contract is fully collateralized at all times.\n\nLyra and MCDEX are examples of on-chain financial applications that utilize Chainlink Price Feeds in order to power Perpetual Contracts, which is a Futures contract without expiry. By using Chainlink oracles, these protocols are able to ensure the solvency of their platform by having access to real-time price data for both determining when liquidations should occur and dynamically setting the funding rate to maintain net neutral exposure.\n\nSimilar to futures contracts, options are a type of financial derivative that grant traders the “option” to buy or sell a certain amount of a particular asset by a future date if they so choose. In the off-chain world, centralized entities most frequently underwrite the contracts, but on the blockchain, decentralized peer-to-peer options are possible.\n\nOpyn and Thales are examples of options protocols that use Chainlink Price Feeds to calculate the valuation of crypto assets, enabling users to mint, trade, and settle options contracts. Additionally, Chainlink oracle nodes like dxFeed provide Implied Volatility (IV) data on various crypto assets, granting contract creators the ability to calculate an option’s contract premium in a reliable and tamper-resistant manner.\n\nSynthetic assets are a category of financial instruments that provide traders price exposure to specific assets, such as indices or commodities, without requiring ownership of the physical asset itself. Smart contract-based synthetic assets allow traders to create advanced non-custodial trading strategies and gain exposure to traditional assets that do not exist on the blockchain.\n\nSynthetix is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the minting of various “synths” that allow traders to gain on-chain exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, indices, equities, and more. Through a peer-to-contract trading model, users are able to swap between these synthetic tokens with zero slippage using Chainlink Price Feeds to access the current value of the underlying assets.\n\nCredit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial agreements that allow lenders to hedge against the possible occurrence of a default (lack of payment) from a borrower. If the borrower goes into default, the party who issued and sold the Credit Default Swap reimburses the lender for the outstanding funds not paid by the borrower.\n\nOpium.Exchange is an example of an on-chain protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle various financial instrument products. One of these products includes a Credit Default Swap on the centralized stablecoin USDT Tether, allowing traders to hedge against Tether deviating and falling below its $1 peg.\n\nBonds are a financial agreement that enables the raising of short-term capital by issuing debt to be paid back at a later date. Traditional bond contracts can be replicated as an automated smart contract through the use of Chainlink oracles, which provide the data required for settlement such as interest rates, debt scores, fiat payments, and more.\n\nChainlink has already demonstrated such capability with a POC with SWIFT, where oracles were used to aggregate interest rates from five major banks, fetch debt score data from S\u0026P, and generate an interest payment in the form of an ISO20022 SWIFT payment message. As a multi-trillion dollar industry, bringing bonds onto the blockchain can greatly reduce counterparty risk and lower operational costs across the board.\n\nA unique use case for smart contracts is non-custodial “smart portfolios” that automatically rebalance user portfolios by executing trades on their behalf based on preset conditions. This provides users with advanced financial products that programmatically manage investments based on the current market-wide price of specific assets and tokens. These trading strategies can be tokenized, allowing users to transfer and use these tokens within other smart contract applications.\n\nTokensets is one such example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to generate various “Sets,” tokenized positions that execute trades on the behalf of users. These Sets are based on Technical Analysis (TA) metrics such as the RSI or moving averages, designed to catch key price action trends. Additionally, users can use their Set tokens as collateral within other protocols, such as the Aave money market, to gain additional capital efficiency.\n\nWrapped cross-chain assets—cryptocurrencies/tokens native to one blockchain that are locked into a contract and then “unlocked” on another blockchain—are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to increase the collateral types available within the DeFi ecosystem. However, in order to ensure the integrity of DeFi applications supporting wrapped asset deposits, Proof of Reserve reference contracts can be used to supply data regarding the true collateralization of these on-chain assets.\n\nTwo protocols using Chainlink to power Proof of Reserve reference feeds include BitGo’s WBTC and Ren Protocol’s renBTC, representing a large majority of the wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and representing billions in USD value. These Proof of Reserve reference feeds provide DeFi protocols with the data they need to autonomously verify collateral reserves and swiftly protect user funds during an undercollateralization event. Proof of Reserve reference feeds can also be used to track the collateralization of assets beyond cross-chain tokens including stablecoins and real-world commodities, further increasing the collateral available within DeFi.\n\nBringing real-world assets onto the blockchain provides a large potential to expand the economic activity of DeFi, as seen with the adoption of fiat-backed stablecoins. However, this requires the underlying collateral to be held by a central custodian, disconnecting the on-chain tokenized representation from the actual off-chain asset itself. Through Chainlink Proof of Reserve, smart contacts are able to autonomously audit the collateralization of real-world asset-backed tokens, protecting users during black swan events.\n\nExamples of this are the Paxos Proof of Reserve for PAX and PAXG as well as the TrustToken Proof of Reserve for TUSD. The latter provides DeFi applications with data regarding the true amount of US dollars backing the stablecoin TUSD held by TrustToken’s off-chain escrowed bank accounts as reviewed by Armanino, an independent top-25 auditing firm in the United States. This collateralization data can be checked against the total amount of circulating TUSD tokens on various blockchains, as reported by the complementary TUSD Proof of Supply feed, to determine the collateralization of TrustToken’s tokenized USD.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to automatically execute trading strategies at predetermined intervals. However, a range of variables can influence the profitability of those strategies, specifically network gas costs. Thus, traders using automated systems need reliable data from oracles in order to ensure that their trades will be consistently profitable.\n\nPickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation in its Pickle Jars product to help automatically manage capital-efficient LP positions across Uniswap v3. By automatically rebalancing users’ LP positions, Chainlink Automation helps ensure the positions remain in range and collect maximum LP fees—helping maximize returns for users.\n\nAs an increasing number of DeFi products launch with DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, there becomes more of a need for developers and community members to distribute the revenue generated by a DeFi protocol in a decentralized and real-time manner. Through the usage of Chainlink oracles, DAOs can distribute crypto revenues proportionally according to various metrics, such as staked coins, governance participation, developer activity, or any customized set of requirements.\n\nSynthetix is one example of a DeFi protocol that will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards each week to users. Chainlink Automation will monitor the smart contract’s state off-chain and autonomously call the fee distribution function in the protocol’s feePools smart contract after the fee period duration has ended.\n\nYield Farming is a new financial primitive within the DeFi ecosystem that is used to bootstrap liquidity and facilitate the fair distribution of a protocol’s governance tokens. In most yield farming applications, users who provide liquidity to a protocol are granted a reward in the form of its native governance token, serving as a growth subsidy.\n\nTwo protocols using Chainlink oracles in their yield farming mechanisms are Plasm and StrongBlock. Plasm uses Chainlink price oracles to help determine the amount of value users have locked into the protocol and then distributes rewards accordingly, while StrongBlock calculates the USD value locked in Community pools once every 24 hours.\n\nYield optimizing protocols automatically harvest and compound yield for their users. Users deposit tokens into a vault that automatically harvests yield at critical points to maximize compounding returns. However, as smart contracts cannot execute their own functions, yield optimizers need an external entity to trigger an on-chain transaction. Instead of depending on unreliable public bounties or centralized bots with a single point of failure to automate transactions, many yield optimizers use a trust-minimized solution.\n\nChainlink Automation enables developers to trigger smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner, and has already powered tens of thousands of automated transactions across Web3. Developers can set them to autocompound yield at regular periods or build advanced optimization strategies that only execute when it’s profitable to do so.\n\nFor example, the yield optimizer Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation to help yield aggregators build more advanced, fully automated vault strategies. With Chainlink Automation, Pickle Finance is able to increase rewards for depositors without relying on manual intervention or introducing a single point of failure would make its platform vulnerable to manipulation and technical failures.

With these positions, borrowers can maximize the value of their assets through various yield farming strategies while lenders earn a passive income from borrowers who want to amplify their farming positions. This results in an application-specific money market specially focused around the activity of yield farming.\n\nAlpaca Finance is one example of a protocol using Chainlink Price Feeds to enable users to leverage up their positions on PancakeSwap and WaultSwap by borrowing capital to increase their positions. Financial market data from Price Feeds is used to calculate proper collateralization ratios during loan issuance and liquidate positions to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol, even during market volatility in the valuation of the collateral deposited by borrowers.\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand across a number of blockchain networks, the opportunity for generating yield from existing protocols like Aave will fractionalize across disconnected environments. In order to overcome this issue, a cross-chain token bridge is required to facilitate the transfer of user funds across networks. However, existing cross-chain solutions are vulnerable to exploitation, with hundreds of millions of dollars already having been siphoned from such protocols. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a secure open-source standard for transferring messages and tokens across blockchain networks, overcomes these issues and will provide developers with the tamper-resistant infrastructure required to create multi-chain yield earning platforms.\n\nAs a new DeFi-enabled financial primitive, self-paying loan protocols enable users to deposit assets as collateral and borrow/mint synthetic assets to provide working capital. The deposited collateral is routed to a yield-generating protocol, where the yield is used to automatically pay down the debt over time, creating a highly capital-efficient borrowing position.\n\nOne implementation of this new financial primitive is Alchemix, a self-paying loan protocol that uses Chainlink Automation to provide users an advance on their future yield over time for deposits of DAI and ETH. Automation is used to trigger vault harvesting and vault flushing each day, automating debt repayment and reallocating new depositing into Yearn Finance to generate yield.\n\nIn certain instances of exceptionally high volatility, the prices for assets on a cryptocurrency exchange may cease to reflect the prices seen on the wider market. This can lead to a loss of funds to arbitrageurs, or to users getting wrongly liquidated due to leveraged positions they had open. Such occurrences can reduce user trust in an exchange. Exchanges can benefit from using a circuit breaker that trips should certain deviations occur.\n\nDigitex is an example of a traditional exchange that protects users from market manipulation by monitoring for deviation between their internal price feeds and Chainlink Price Feeds as an additional layer of security for users trading on the platform. If the exchange’s price deviates beyond a certain percentage from the wider market price reported by Chainlink oracles, a “circuit breaker” can be triggered to temporarily halt trading and liquidations.\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) are on-chain trading venues that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without taking custody of those assets or giving out personal information to a centralized institution. As DEXs grow in popularity, the desire for traditional trading strategies and advanced features currently available on traditional centralized exchanges grows in importance.\n\n0x Relayer Bamboo Relay is an example of a decentralized exchange that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss order functionalities—conditional trading functions based on the price action of an asset. With aggregated market data from Chainlink, each trader’s stop-loss order will only be executed when the market-wide price of the asset surpasses a certain predefined threshold, preventing market manipulation attacks from falsely executing trades.\n\nAutomated Market Makers (AMMs) are an increasingly popular category of decentralized exchanges. Instead of traditional order books, AMMs are on-chain liquidity pools that facilitate asset swaps based on a predetermined price formula. By pooling capital, liquidity providers are able to earn passive yield and traders gain access to on-demand liquidity.\n\nDODO is an example of an AMM protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power a new AMM design known as a Proactive Market Maker. DODO’s PMM mimics human market-making behaviors and gathers more capital near the market price reported by Chainlink in order to facilitate more efficient and frequent trading.\n\nMany protocols rely on some form of staking—the locking of cryptocurrency collateral into a smart contract—in order to secure their crypto-economic networks. Staked collateral might help signal where rewards should be proportionally distributed, or it can be “slashed”—programmatically taken under certain conditions as a means of disincentivizing malicious behaviors.\n\nFor instance, AdEx requires its validator nodes to stake collateral and maintain high availability. AdEx uses Chainlink oracles to monitor node uptime and trigger the slashing of collateral should any node fall below the uptime requirements. This ensures that only high-quality node operators participate in the network, which in turn enhances the security of the entire platform.\n\nRebasing is a new financial primitive within DeFi that involves the act of adjusting the supply of a token as a means to maintain its peg to a specific reference asset, such as the US dollar. If the price of the token is above its peg during the rebase, then more tokens are minted and given proportionally to all token holders with the goal of lowering the per token price. Conversely, if the price of the token is below the peg, then a certain percentage of each holder’s tokens are burned to raise the per token price.\n\nAmpleforth is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power its native rebasing functionality. The total supply of AMPL is rebased on a daily basis to track the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate, an index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the current value of the inflation-adjusted 2019 US dollar. Both the volume-weighted average price of AMPL and the CPI index are provided to the Ampleforth protocol by Chainlink oracles.\n\nAs discussed in our recent education piece, tokenized real-world assets are among the most promising use cases for blockchain and smart contract technology. They take real-world assets and represent them on the blockchain as a token. Compared to traditional assets, tokenized assets benefit from global accessibility, permissionless liquidity, on-chain transparency, and reduced transactional friction.\n\nBlockchain money markets are commonly overcollateralized to ensure user loans can be properly liquidated when the collateral drops in value and/or the debt rises in value, thereby keeping user funds in the market safe. However, because smart contracts are “asleep” by default, liquidations need to be performed by an external party to “wake up” the contract to close a position by paying down the debt. The process needs to be highly reliable to ensure no toxic loan positions on created and left open.\n\nAave is one example of a money market protocol with tens of billions of dollars in user deposits that will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of user positions. Chainlink Automation will monitor the collateralization ratio of user positions, and if any position falls below the predefined threshold of the collateral (e.g. 150%), the decentralized Chainlink Automation Network will call the liquidation function and close the position, even during heavy market volatility and blockchain network congestion.\n\nIt’s easy for smart contracts to issue payments in the cryptocurrency of their native blockchain, such as Ethereum smart contracts issuing payments in ETH, for example. However, many businesses can’t afford the risk of holding volatile cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheet. They also don’t want the additional friction of trading out cryptocurrency for their preferred fiat currency. Given the wide variety of payment preferences around the world, smart contracts need access to many types of payment options to adequately service global demand. Chainlink can facilitate a wide variety of payment services thanks to its ability to push outputs from smart contracts to external APIs.\n\nChainlink enables smart contracts to connect to existing banking systems, allowing smart contract developers to seamlessly integrate information and services such as consumer bank accounts, direct deposit, and other processes from leading global banks.\n\nMany consumer applications such as Uber and AirBnB offer popular retail payments to users. Chainlink can bring the same ease of use to smart contracts by giving them access to leading credit card providers and established payment networks, like PayPal and Stripe. Developers can start building applications that take advantage of the most in-demand payment outputs, both domestically and internationally, used on a daily basis in the retail economy. Chainlink already has pre-built modular external adapters for popular retail payment rails such as PayPal and Mistertango.\n\nCryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular, but some of the popular choices are often disconnected from the leading smart contract platforms. Chainlink bridges the gap by allowing any smart contract platform to make payments on any other distributed ledger, such as Bitcoin payments triggered from the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to provide exchange rates at the time of transfer or point of sale, ensuring users get fair market rates in a tamper-proof manner.\n\nAlchemy and Paycoin are examples of hybrid crypto/fiat payment platforms that will use Chainlink Price Feeds to determine exchange rates, allowing users to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies while the merchant still receives their preferred form of payment.\n\nOne significant source of inefficiency across nearly all industries in the legacy world is the delay in payments for services rendered to employees and contractors. Chainlink-powered smart contracts can be used to programmatically distribute payments to workers in real-time, which would reduce accounting overhead costs for employers, as well as providing access to earned wages for workers on a more immediate basis.\n\nFiat on/off-ramp aggregator Transak laid out how this could work by using a work tracking API like WakaTime to trigger payments to developers on a regular basis. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to calculate the exact amount of crypto revenue to distribute, maintaining a certain USD value per payout.\n\nRemittances are quite common in an increasingly globalized world. However, despite advancements in technology, it’s a slow and expensive industry. Many DLT projects are aiming to disrupt the remittance industry and Chainlink oracles can provide reliable data on foreign exchange rates to smart contracts as well as enable direct deposit upon transfer.\n\nBlockchain technology can replace backend processes across the financial system with modern digitized solutions. Through the automation of backend processes and syncing multiple ledgers of record, financial service providers can substantially reduce risk and enhance capital efficiency.\n\nBringing real-world assets onchain—from currencies to stocks to bonds to real estate to gold—unlocks opportunities to increase investor access, enhance transparency, and strengthen market liquidity. Santander has reported that blockchain technology could help reduce banks’ infrastructure costs by $15-20B annually through the automation of backend office operations.\n\nHaving high-quality, reliable data about the market price delivered onchain by Chainlink Price Feeds is essential for the creation of high-integrity markets for tokenized assets. For example, the PAXG Chainlink Price Feed—a tokenized gold token redeemable for one fine troy ounce of gold—enables secure markets to be built around physical gold. Additionally, Paxos uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to enable onchain verifications that their tokenized gold products are fully backed by gold reserves custodied offchain.\n\nTo help bring capital markets onchain, Chainlink is working with The Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system processing $2+ quadrillion annually. DTCC is exploring how Chainlink CCIP can unlock tokenized asset interoperability. Additionally, as part of a previous collaboration with Swift and Chainlink, DTCC minted and issued “BondTokens” compatible with CCIP and distributed them onchain to Swift’s designated test wallets.\n\nCCIP enables the secure transfer of arbitrary data, tokens, and instructions between public and private blockchains. As the financial system increasingly moves assets onchain, CCIP can help securely transfer tokenized assets cross-chain, increasing access to the financial system for developing countries, enabling the creation of innovative new financial instruments, and enhancing liquidity for global markets.\n\nSwift and Chainlink, along with 12+ world-leading financial institutions, including DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream, ANZ Bank, Citi, BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Lloyds Banking Group, and SDX, successfully demonstrated a secure and scalable way to transfer tokenized assets cross-chain using CCIP and financial institutions’ existing backend infrastructure.\n\n“The collaboration between Swift, Chainlink, and the financial community represents significant progress towards enabling interoperability between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain networks […] By leveraging existing Swift infrastructure and Chainlink CCIP, the collaboration demonstrated the ability to transfer tokenised value efficiently and securely across public and private blockchains, using standardised messaging formats and proven business processes.”—SwiftCorporate action errors cost 70% of market participants more than $2M in 2020, of which 56% were due to data issues.\n\nBlockchains create a shared source of truth or “golden record” that aligns various stakeholders around an immutable source of hyper-reliable corporate action data. This helps mitigate costly errors and removes the need for downstream stakeholders in corporate processes, such as the custodian, to recheck the accuracy of key data from multiple sources.\n\nHaving this golden record onchain along with high-quality data and computation delivered onchain by Chainlink enables various corporate actions to be automated with smart contracts, reducing operational costs and shortening processing times. For example, a tokenized bond could have predetermined coupon payments embedded within the digital asset at the point of issuance.\n\nExamples of corporate actions that can benefit from blockchain technology include:Chainlink CCIP provides financial institutions with the ability to trade and settle tokenized assets across public and private blockchains, unlocking onchain DvP and atomic settlement for capital markets.\n\nFor example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), the largest institutional bank in Australia with over $1 trillion in assets under management, worked with Chainlink to demonstrate cross-chain tokenized asset settlement transactions using CCIP and ANZ-issued stablecoins and tokenized assets.\n\n“The value and the message moving together is revolutionary. That’s a real breakthrough.”—Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead at ANZ, at Sibos 2023While DeFi is currently the largest smart contract market, developers are increasingly building fraudproof, crypto-economically incentivized gaming applications. One of the unique characteristics of blockchain games is their ability to generate rare tokenized in-game items (mostly as NFTs), as the blockchain provides definite proof of the item’s rarity. Minting these rare items in a manner that the external entities or the game’s developers can manipulate to their own advantage is key to ensuring their value, which is why Chainlink developed a Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF is a secure and provably fair source of Random Number Generation (RNG), which generates on-chain cryptographic proofs to prove to users that the randomness was not tampered with.\n\nTheir provably fair form of randomness brings reliability to the rarity of items, opening up things like virtual metaverses, where tokenized items can be reliably used across different games. Verifiable randomness is also critical to creating unquestioned fairness to regulated gambling applications, removing the need to trust that the house is telling the truth about their odds. Additionally, Chainlink VRF can order participants for in-demand giveaways and events or fairly select participants for low-demand events like jury duty in an unbiased manner. Beyond randomness, gaming can benefit from numerous data sets, such as real-world event data to augment in-game functions/ratings, exchange rates to facilitate NFT markets, IoT data to connect the physical world on-chain, and much more.\n\nIn-game items are a critical component of most games, as they provide users with special powers or unique attributes. Many in-game items are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a token that is unique and not interchangeable. Chainlink VRF is already playing an important role in generating provably random NFTs and creating NFT attributes as rewards for different predefined in-game achievements, such as earning a rare skin for finishing in the top 10.\n\nAavegotchi is an example of an on-chain gaming project on the Polygon sidechain that used Chainlink VRF to quickly and efficiently mint provably rare Aavegotchi NFTs with randomly selected attributes when players opened Portals. Another example is Ether Legends, a digital collectible trading card game that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFT prizes to top-tier players at the end of a season. Popular gaming dApp Axie Infinity also recently announced that it is using Chainlink VRF to generate provably random traits for Origin Axies within the game’s digital pet universe.\n\nDynamic NFTs expand upon the concept of NFTs by enabling such tokens to evolve and change over time as determined by real-world events or verifiable randomness delivered by Chainlink oracles. Compared to static NFTs, which do not change after minting, dynamic NFTs can change in rarity and utility over time, providing a gamified experience to collecting NFTs.\n\nMLB star Trey Mancini and NBA Rookie of the Year LaMelo Ball are two examples of athletes who have minted Dynamic NFTs powered by Chainlink oracles on the Ethereum blockchain. With the former, the NFTs are represented as limited-edition digital baseball cards that use Chainlink VRF to assign special utility to NFTs in a verifiably fair and unbiased manner, with all NFT sale proceeds going to cancer research. For the latter, the NFTs upgrade over time according to the player’s performance in the real world, where the EVOLVE tokens were activated when LaMelo Ball was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nUnpredictability is one of the hallmarks of fun games. The excitement of not knowing the next stage or what will happen around the corner creates suspense, intrigue, and challenge. Developers can leverage Chainlink VRF to ensure the integrity of unpredictable events. Some of these gameplay scenarios may include map generation, critical hits (battling games), matchmaking (multiplayer games), card draw order, and random encounters/events.\n\nBlockchain prediction markets enable individuals to bet on the outcome of specific real-world events. Due to their very nature, blockchain-based prediction markets, are reliant on external data to settle outcomes. Chainlink Data Feeds provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant source of external data that can be used to trigger the settlement of prediction markets as well as payment to the winners. Prediction markets have been created around sporting events results, political election outcomes, and cryptocurrency roadmap completions and price predictions, but ultimately prediction markets can encompass any type of wager as long as there are takers on the other side.\n\nAlong with Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Automation is increasingly playing a key role in enhancing the security and decentralization of prediction markets. Instead of relying on DevOps teams, centralized automation bots like cron jobs, or incentive bounties to start and stop each prediction round and select the winner, Chainlink Automation can automate smart contract functions by triggering smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. Learn more in the Chainlink Automation developer documentation.\n\nNot only does Chainlink Automation save developers hundreds of hours, it also significantly enhances the security of prediction markets. By integrating Chainlink Automation into their prediction games to help start and stop prediction rounds and distribute rewards to winners, Entropyfi eliminated a single point of failure and was able to save 20 engineering hours per week.\n\nEveripedia, a blockchain-based encyclopedia, recently used Chainlink to relay election results on-chain to help settle prediction markets. Everipedia operates a Chainlink oracle node and delivered cryptographically signed data from The Associated Press regarding the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election onto the Ethereum blockchain, where Chainlink Data Feeds were then used by on-chain prediction markets such as YieldWars.\n\nGameFi is a subsection of blockchain-based gaming. GameFi games enable players to earn in-game rewards. As its name suggests, GameFi lies at the intersection of blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance. By offering economic incentives, developers can create an engaging gaming experience that encourages players to participate in the game’s ecosystem.\n\nOn GameFi platforms, players can earn rewards by progressing through the game, battling other players, and completing special tasks. Rewards include in-game tokens and NFTs representing weapons, skins, avatars, and virtual land, which can then be traded or sold on secondary markets, such as decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces. Non-custodial ownership gives players full control over their in-game assets, potentially enabling users to take their NFTs to other games and metaverses in the future.\n\nAutomation is essential for developing advanced GameFi experiences. Developers need to automate smart contract functions to start and end game rounds on time, distribute rewards to players based on particular game outcomes, and much more. While developers could automate these processes using scripts on a centralized server, this would consume valuable time and create a single point of failure that could lead to exploits and reliability issues. In contrast, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can trigger smart contract functions in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner.\n\nFor example, the gamified NFT platform Nifty Royale is using Chainlink Automation to help trigger its NFT-based battle royale games. Specifically, Nifty Royale is using Automation to trigger the smart contract functions that start and end each round of its battle royale. By using Automation, Nifty Royale is increasing the security and reliability guarantees of its game, which is especially important as players can win in-game assets that have real-world value. If you want to take advantage of Chainlink Automation in your own GameFi project, explore the docs now.\n\nAdvancements in DeFi composability have led to innovative applications such as no-loss savings games—dApps which pool user deposits and lend them out on a decentralized money market in order to accrue interest. After a specified time frame, a winner is selected, earning all the accumulated interest from the pool. After the winner is chosen, all users are able to withdraw their original deposit without any loss.\n\nAn example of this is PoolTogether, an on-chain no-loss savings game that uses Chainlink VRF to select the winner of each prize. By utilizing a transparent and verifiable source of on-chain randomness, users are provided a higher degree of trust in the overall reliability and fairness of the no-loss prize pool platform.\n\nSmart contracts provide integrity to the execution of an online sports bet, while Chainlink decentralized oracle networks can verify sporting outcomes by aggregating data from reliable web APIs. These smart contracts (usually in the form of prediction markets) can be based on a match’s result, individual performances, or even something as seemingly inconsequential as a game’s opening coin toss. On top of that, it’s possible for eSports prediction markets to retrieve gaming data and broadcast it on-chain to determine the winners.\n\nOne example of a blockchain-based sports betting market is Augur, which uses Chainlink oracles on the high-throughput Polygon sidechain to power its Turbo prediction markets. Users can speculate on the outcome of a wide range of topics including different sports events in the NBA, MLB, MMA, and Olympics that are rapidly settled after a market closes using decentralized oracle networks that provide premium real-world data.\n\nThe insurance industry today operates in a low-trust business environment. Policyholders have an incentive to falsely report positive metrics in insurance applications to reduce their monthly deductibles and insurers have an incentive to delay payments and raise rates to account for misrepresented risk profiles. Since insurance companies are responsible for processing claims and are much more capitalized than policyholders, they wield substantially more power in terms of when and how claims are settled. Chainlink-powered smart contracts shift insurance contracts towards a more objective, equal-standing model where data directly determines the outcomes and execution is deterministic, without tampering by either party.\n\nTraditional insurance firms can leverage the benefits of blockchain technology by creating advanced smart contract-based parametric insurance agreements that automatically trigger payouts based on real-world data as delivered by decentralized oracle networks. By reducing reliance on manual arbitration and mitigating delayed payments as a result, coverage can be provided to a broader range of businesses to hedge a wide range of risks that exist in the real world.\n\nCrop insurance has long been considered an especially promising use case for smart contracts as it provides farmers in developing nations with insurance which they otherwise could not get access to or don’t trust due to underdeveloped local insurance markets. By providing anyone with an Internet connection the ability to hedge against unforeseen weather conditions, farmers all over the world are able to maintain their livelihood without the concern that one bad weather season could cause financial ruin.\n\nOne example of this is Arbol, a smart contract-based weather coverage solution that uses Chainlink oracles to fetch rainfall datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data is used to settle parametric crop insurance contracts that provide coverage based on the amount of rainfall in the region.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of smart contract insurance to reach production is flight insurance. Due to a range of uncontrollable variables such as weather and maintenance, flights are often delayed, leading to inconveniences for business travelers. Flight insurance policies allow travelers to mitigate these opportunity costs, as they pay out compensation in the event of a delay.\n\nOne example is Etherisc, a decentralized insurance protocol that leverages Chainlink oracles to retrieve flight data in order to confirm whether or not it’s been delayed. By removing the need for dispute periods, insurees are guaranteed that they will immediately receive a payment if their flight was delayed and insurers are able to reduce costs by removing manual claims processing.\n\nModern vehicles come with a wide range of internal sensors, internet connectivity, and even native APIs. The winner of Chainlink’s 2020 Virtual Hackathon, Link My Ride, made use of some of these data points, allowing the smart contract to specify a rental period, unlock the vehicle doors for the renter, record the length of time rented, calculate mileage driven, determine the remaining battery charge, and automate rental payments. These functionalities came together to create a complex car rental contract for a Tesla vehicle using a custom external adapter. As vehicle-based APIs grow more sophisticated, new forms of insurance will become available including parametric car insurance that triggers based on numerous impact sensors in the vehicle or insurance discounts based on metrics like mileage driven per year.\n\nThe growing “smart home” phenomenon is leading to sensors and advanced security systems that automatically inform homeowners and emergency services of unusual events. These sensors can be connected to smart contracts through Chainlink oracles in order to create new parametric home insurance products. Especially useful for vacation homes and other residences that are not used year-round, insurance products can be wired to detect broken pipes, malfunctioning solar panels, or even home intrusions as a means of a more direct skin-in-the-game alarm system protection from companies.\n\nSmart contracts with sound data are ideal for reducing the costs and occurrence of disputes, as well as speeding up the time of settlement. Numerous web APIs and external databases host sufficient data for determining if and when a death occurred, such as death certificates, obituaries, cremation records, and police reports. Chainlink can use that data to autonomously issue out payments and distribute assets amongst several parties listed in a life insurance policy, eliminating unnecessary overhead and accelerating payments to policyholders.\n\nDue to countless advancements in biotech and IoT wearables (e.g. Smartwatches), insurance companies can create smart contracts that offer health insurance discounts or trigger penalties based on a patient’s health data. Useful data points can include distance traveled (exercise), body weight, heart rate, and possibly more advanced biometrics as they are made available into the future. Chainlink oracles can also spot data anomalies that can trigger mandatory consultations in order to keep favorable policy rates.\n\nGran Fondo, an ETHDenver 2019 Hackathon entry, used Chainlink oracles to bring GPS time-stamped data from IoT wearable devices on-chain to enable the creation of on-chain athletic competitions that payout in ETH. This same exact data can also be used to create health insurance contracts that determine premium rates based on the amount of physical activity within a certain time frame as recorded by the Chainlink-connected IoT wearable device.\n\nClimate-related uncertainty is leading to increasingly unpredictable seaway conditions such as low or high water levels. This can result in hundreds of millions of dollars lost due to the temporary closing of major shipping seaway channels. Smart contracts can use Chainlink oracles to connect to an array of real-world sensors to issue parametric insurance coverage for a wide range of coverage protections, such as the thawing of frozen goods during transit, damages to shipping vessels, or late shipments due to unforeseen weather conditions.\n\nOne example of this is a hackathon project aimed to insure cargo carriers in the event of the climate change-related closure of major shipping routes. Chainlink oracles connected to water level sensors that trigger insurance payouts in the event of water dropping or rising above present levels determined to lead to waterway closures.\n\nInsurance is a difficult industry for potential entrepreneurs to enter because of the risks associated with underwriting large numbers of policies. In a catastrophic event, an insurance company may be unable to cover all obligations, leading to default. As such, many companies “reinsure” their underwritten portfolio—offloading a portion of their risk in case they cannot cover all claims.\n\nOne possible solution would be to tokenize reinsurance policies as smart contracts. This would allow individual investors to back insurance policies by buying fractions of a policy. Chainlink oracles can be used within this process to denominate the current value of an insurance policy, route insurance payments to token holders, and autonomously trigger insurance payouts.\n\nSmart contracts provide ample opportunities for enterprises to cut costs and improve efficiency in multi-party business processes thanks to reductions in counterparty risk, intermediary overhead, and external disputes. However, in order to leverage smart contracts, enterprises require additional considerations around privacy, scalability, and connectivity in order to meet certain business and legal requirements. Chainlink provides a gateway for enterprises to both sell their data and API services to blockchain environments and satisfy certain technical requirements like on-chain access to private data, off-chain computation of contract logic, on-chain privacy of transactions, and much more.\n\nJust as the Internet acts as a single gateway for connecting computers, Chainlink provides enterprises with a single middleware for connecting their APIs to every blockchain environment. Chainlink is blockchain agnostic and can be integrated onto any current and future blockchain, with many leading chains already supporting Chainlink, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more. By having Chainlink operate across all the major chains, enterprises can leverage it as a “blockchain abstraction layer” used to get their existing systems “blockchain-enabled” across any/all chains efficiently.\n\nThis reduces integration work to a minimum so enterprises don’t have to rebuild existing infrastructure, but instead can focus on their core blockchain strategy. Vendor lock-in is limited by removing the burden of enterprises to choose which blockchain is the most likely to become the industry standard. Additionally, Chainlink nodes provide key advantages such as secure private key management, secure off-chain computation, trust-minimized hardware, permission controls, and more.\n\nChainlink’s built-in flexibility ensures it’s fully compatible with existing legacy data and API infrastructure. Thus, data providers can also use Chainlink’s blockchain abstraction layer to sell their data to smart contracts on any blockchain. This can be done in two ways: selling data to the Chainlink Network or the data provider running their own Chainlink oracle node to sell data directly to blockchains.\n\nBy selling data to the Chainlink Network, data providers don’t need to change anything about their current business model, meaning back-end modifications aren’t necessary and they can accept payments in fiat currency. Alternatively, data providers who see the value in the smart contract economy can run a Chainlink Node to provide signed data (using digital signatures) directly to smart contracts, allowing them to earn more revenue and build a reputation as a reliable data provider.\n\nOperating a Chainlink node enables data providers to begin selling their API connections to smart contracts applications. To simplify the experience of launching a Chainlink oracle node, infrastructure providers can offer Node-as-Service (NaaS) solutions in order to quickly spin up new Chainlink nodes and connect a data provider’s existing APIs to blockchain networks in a backward-compatible manner.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a leading cloud provider that has collaborated with Chainlink Labs to launch the AWS Chainlink Quickstart—a one-click workflow for data providers and DevOps teams to easily launch a Chainlink oracle node on AWS Cloud and sell real-world data to smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks. The future-proof framework enables data providers to seamlessly launch a Chainlink node on AWS, allowing them to cryptographically sign their data and broadcast it onto blockchains where it can be sold to smart contract applications.\n\nAs smart contracts evolve, there becomes an increasing demand for more advanced decentralized applications that require expensive or complex computations which are not feasible on-chain. One solution is using oracles to attest to off-chain computations processed within more scalable cloud computing environments. Leveraging Chainlink’s bidirectional communication capabilities, hybrid cloud/blockchain applications can be created that route computational instructions and/or data off-chain for processing, as well as bridge the results back on-chain for smart contract use.\n\nOne example is NOAA weather hosted on Google Cloud which is being brought onto the Etheruem blockchain using Chainlink oracles. Through this integration, smart contracts can access high-quality weather data (temperature, precipitation, hail, etc) to power parametric crop insurance agreements such as those offered by Arbol.\n\nFor many enterprises and institutions, data privacy is not an optional bonus but instead a strict requirement necessary to meet regulatory mandates such as GDPR. Chainlink is developing a cutting-edge solution to this challenge through the recent acquisition of DECO—a privacy-preserving oracle technology created by an Ari Juels-led team at Cornell University.\n\nDECO allows all data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS, which is most of the world’s data, to be confidentially attested to by oracles without the data ever being revealed on-chain (it never leaves the off-chain database) and without any modifications to the servers hosting the off-chain data. For example, Alice is able to use DECO to prove her bank account balance is above a certain threshold without revealing her exact account balance or her identity on-chain or to the oracle itself. This opens up nearly all of the world’s data to be leveraged on-chain while still retaining confidentiality and data licensing agreements.\n\nIn addition to privacy of data inputs, many enterprises want privacy of contract logic and outputs. Chainlink has developed a way of using oracles to provide on-chain transaction privacy for DeFi smart contracts via a solution called Mixicles. Mixicles separate the on-chain data inputs from on-chain payment outputs, using an oracle as the bridge between the two components and a transaction mixer. Instead of delivering the raw data input on-chain, Chainlink oracles post an integer representation that only has meaning to the contract participants (e.g. a 1 or 2 as seen in the example below). A mixer can then take that integer input to execute a payout to a party that is concealed, yet still produces an on-chain audit report for users as a means of meeting regulatory requirements. The Mixicles protocol is able to achieve multiple layers of privacy, such as concealing the terms of the contract, the data source used, the true value of funds within the contract, and who received the payment (in terms of correlation to the input).\n\nChainlink practices a defense-in-depth approach to security, where users leverage multiple layers of security to get a variety of guarantees. Another solution being developed by Chainlink is Town Crier, an oracle protocol that uses additional hardware in the form of a trusted execution environment (TEE) to achieve private, generalized off-chain computation.\n\nTown Crier uses TEE-based oracles (specifically Intel SGX) to enable Chainlink oracle nodes to perform advanced computations on data within a black box environment where data cannot be leaked, even to the node operator. Town Crier provides both data confidentiality and computation integrity, opening up new oracle use cases like handling private keys for cryptocurrency payments or user login credentials for identity verifications.\n\nAs smart contracts continue to accelerate in adoption, there is an increasing demand for practical scaling solutions that can boost the throughput and lower the latency of decentralized applications, while retaining base-layer security of user funds. Commonly these layer-2 scalability solutions require the existence of one or more off-chain validator nodes that are responsible for batching transactions and delivering a succinct response onto the base-layer chain as needed.\n\nChainlink oracle nodes are compute-enabled and can serve as validators for layer-2 solutions, such as for Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum Rollups. Chainlink nodes can perform Arbitrum computation of Solidity functions, generate fraud proofs, and stake LINK collateral to back their services without any modifications. The end result is using oracles not just for data inputs, but for performing scalable off-chain Solidity computation too.\n\nBlockchains require a decentralized network of infrastructure providers such as validators, sequencers, transcoders, and oracles. Traditional infrastructure providers, such as telecommunications firms or internet service providers, can support the Chainlink Network and earn additional revenue by directly operating a Chainlink oracle node. By leveraging their existing in-house infrastructure, such providers can provide highly reliable oracle services and monetize the growth of the hybrid smart contract ecosystem.\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (Europe’s largest telecommunications provider) operates a Chainlink oracle node and provides financial market data to numerous leading DeFi applications. As the demand for universally connected smart contracts continues to grow, the revenue opportunities can increase, leading to additional infrastructure providers launching Chainlink nodes.\n\n“By operating a Chainlink node, Deutsche Telekom MMS will provide reliable real-world data to Chainlink network users and decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, further supporting the vision of public blockchains as a foundation for numerous use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).” –Deutsche Telekom MMSGiven the novelty, volatility, and regulatory uncertainties around cryptocurrencies/tokens, some enterprises are currently hesitant to personally hold and handle cryptocurrencies. With most blockchain infrastructure requiring cryptocurrency to operate, enterprise adoption still remains limited or even completely blocked off. Instead of waiting on the often slow legal system to resolve the issue or for enterprises to warm up to the idea, Chainlink oracles can be used as a workaround to the problem using common invoicing techniques widely used today to allow them to pay third service providers in fiat, which then handle cryptocurrency payments in the background.\n\nHackathon project LINK Gas Station takes the concept of Meta-Transactions—where blockchain transaction fees are abstracted away and paid by a relayer—and applies it to Chainlink. It uses third-party relayers to manage ownership of the utility tokens LINK and ETH, both of which are needed to pay for Ethereum computation and obtain Chainlink oracle data services. By doing so, the liability and complexity of cryptocurrency ownership shifts away from the enterprise and onto the chosen relayer, resulting in a process where an enterprise can simply pay an invoice in fiat and gain access to the entire decentralized ecosystem. Importantly, enterprises still have full control over the cryptographic private key required to sign-off on transactions.\n\nBaseline Protocol is a framework for syncing enterprise systems of record using the Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference. Baseline uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure disparate enterprise databases are kept in a state of consistency (same set of records) with their counterparties without revealing any confidential data on-chain.\n\nChainlink oracles are a key piece of infrastructure for ensuring Baseline events are using the same external data inputs. For example, dynamic purchase orders can leverage Chainlink oracles to fetch aggregated weather data (from multiple sources) regarding the temperature of the goods being shipped. The price per item in the purchase order can be autonomously updated depending on the temperature, such as bananas with dynamic pricing based on weather conditions. Chainlink’s ability to create consistency around external data inputs creates consistency among business partners, reducing disagreements and reconciliation.\n\nAs outlined in the whitepaper, Chainlink will use service level agreements (SLAs) and staking to create additional security and crypto-economic guarantees for oracle services. The SLA, which exists on-chain and is signed by both parties, defines the terms of the oracle service and the penalties/rewards issued based on the oracle’s performance. The results of the SLAs can be fed into reputation systems where future users can assess the reliability of a node. Enterprises running their own Chainlink Node can use staking-backed SLAs to bootstrap the reliability and security of their data and off-chain services, forcing them to have real economic stakes and reputation on the line for failing to meet their stated requirements. This allows enterprises and data providers to provide deterministic guarantees to automated processes like smart contracts without rebuilding their entire backend systems.\n\nA supply chain starts from the sourcing of materials and ends with delivering goods to the end customer. Along the route there are payments transferred, changes in ownership, customs clearances, regulatory oversights, and documents shared between parties. Smart contracts offer a way to automate these processes as a means of reducing friction and counterparty risks in global trade. Chainlink oracles can connect supply chain smart contracts to web APIs, cloud networks, and various real-world sensors, such as GPS, temperature, velocity, acceleration, humidity, luminosity, and more. This data can be used to trigger payments and transfers of data between parties in a manner that can’t be manipulated by any single party in the supply chain. Such a framework generates a golden source of truth for all involved parties with substantially less overhead.\n\nSupply chains are increasingly making use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to track goods. RFID systems connect inventory items with tags that can be detected at distance via a radio frequency. This allows for simplified and highly efficient tracking of store merchandise, shipping pallets, and many other common inventory methods. With Chainlink oracles, RFID data from the real world can be used to trigger a wide range of on-chain contracts, including the initiation of payment upon receipt of inventory at a warehouse, or autonomous insurance payouts for delayed shipments.\n\nThe Open Library Project, a project created during the Chainlink Virtual Hackathon 2020, used Chainlink oracles to build an RFID blockchain integration that enables users to check RFID-tagged books in and out and record this activity on-chain, creating a decentralized and borderless book rental platform.\n\nIoT sensors can be used to ensure that products in transit are properly maintained throughout the supply chain journey. Examples include keeping food at certain temperatures and sealing containers against tampering. Chainlink can be used to create blockchain IoT integrations by connecting IoT sensors to smart contracts that trigger onchain events, such as payouts and issuing fines depending on whether or not the IoT data confirms quality control standards were adhered to as defined in the predefined purchase order.\n\nChainlink and Vodafone’s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) have successfully demonstrated the seamless exchange of trade documents across diverse platforms and blockchains using CCIP. This collaboration has the potential to enable applications in a supply chain to securely exchange data and tokens across public and private blockchains, and access data from IoT devices via the DAB platform.\n\n“Vodafone DAB and Chainlink are showing how their platforms can be combined to cut through this sea of incompatibility by bridging traditional markets with advanced decentralised platforms. This ensures seamless and secure exchanges of data and services across the global trade ecosystem, estimated to be worth over $30 trillion last year.”—Jorge Bento, CEO of Vodafone DABAnother example of this is PingNET, a decentralized transmission network for IoT devices that uses Chainlink to help enable automated payments between stakeholders based on data from IoT-enabled pallets on PingNET. PingNet also aims to bring other IoT event data onchain, like Humidity, Altitude, UV index, Radiation, and more.\n\nWhen cargo is shipped across borders to countries with varying regulations, most often it requires clearance from the receiving nation’s customs agency to prevent the shipment of illegal or dangerous goods. Many trade finance contracts will require access to this data to determine the status of a shipment in real-time. As smart contracts begin to automate such agreements, they will still require information regarding customs clearance. Chainlink oracles can directly provide this data in a privacy-preserving manner, allowing for end-to-end automation of a cross-border trade finance contract.\n\nInternational trade paperwork largely consists of three main documents: a Bill of Lading, issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment; an Invoice, issued by a seller to a buyer regarding the details of a sales transaction; and a Policy of Insurance—a contract between the insurer and the policyholder stating the claims the insurer is legally required to pay. Each of these documents can benefit from oracles; it would be possible to use oracles to generate a Bill of Lading directly from data, provide foreign exchange rates to Payment Invoices, and provide IoT quality control data to an on-chain Policy of Insurance contract to trigger settlement.\n\nUtilities like water, energy, and the Internet are foundational pillars of modern society. The efficient functioning and management of these utilities is vital to social and physical health, yet they often rely on poorly incentivized business dynamics and outdated infrastructure. Smart contracts bring modernization to utilities infrastructure by moving them towards fairer, automated, real-time systems that use decentralized networks, data, and crypto-economic incentives to enforce such conditions. This ensures that utility providers are held to a higher standard and users have better access to objective data showcasing the quality and status of key utility services.\n\nMany utilities like the Internet, cable TV, and cloud hosting charge customers based on set pricing structures. However, when their services go down, sometimes causing large financial losses due to opportunity costs (e.g. exchanges experiencing downtime due to a cloud outage), no one is held accountable. IoT sensors can monitor the uptime of utilities and Chainlink can feed their performance data into a smart contract to calculate monthly payments or issue reimbursements based on downtime.\n\nETHNewYork 2019 hackathon entry Blocksolid explored a use case where NGOs could hold Internet Service Providers (ISPs) accountable for faulty internet services in developing regions. They did so by tracking Internet Service Provider (ISP) uptime and using Chainlink oracles to relay this data on-chain. If downtime is detected, the on-chain smart contract holding donated funds is updated to prevent withdrawals from the ISP.\n\nEnergy providers are responsible for ensuring all the world’s infrastructure receives the energy required to power the global economy. To increase the efficiency of energy delivery, Chainlink oracles can be used to feed consumption rates into a smart contract to trigger over-consumption penalties, levy CO2 taxes, and provide current energy prices to fairly generate electricity bills and allow payments in different currencies. Smart contracts can take readings from smart meters to monetize someone’s output, track consumption, and facilitate payouts between the two.\n\nDipole, a blockchain-based distributed energy trading market, plans to use Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the on-chain trading and valuation of energy assets. Users can then purchase energy resources using fiat or cryptocurrency with exchange rates determined by Chainlink-powered decentralized price feeds.\n\nWhile often taken for granted, the infrastructure that ensures your tap at home can provide you with water is heavily monitored for quality control and reliability. IoT sensors can monitor water tables, track corporate consumption, and identify illegal siphoning of public bodies. Chainlink can feed data from this IoT data to smart contracts in order to issue regulatory fines, generate consumption invoices, trigger autopayments, update supply tracking databases, or even trigger emergency funding to cities at risk of floods.\n\nThe emissions and waste disposal industries can be transformed by IoT-enabled smart contracts that can accurately measure output and efficiency. Through Chainlink oracles, this data can be used to automatically trigger payments to the proper regulating body for overconsumption, monetize the garbage used in recycling or waste-to-fuel technologies, or generate incentivized payment structures that lower garbage bills when someone consumes less or uses more biodegradable items.\n\nWhile smart contract-enabled blockchain networks are inherently pseudonymous, there is strong demand for users to be able to prove their real-life identity as means of ensuring Sybil-resistance and/or granting clearance. Through Chainlink oracles, traditional data infrastructure containing user identities (such as governmental databases, social media, etc.) can be connected to smart contract applications, either by tying a user’s identity to their on-chain address or attesting to data in an off-chain server. This ensures institutions are able to maintain full regulatory compliance and provide an additional layer of security via dealing with known identities.\n\nE-signatures have become an increasingly popular way to obtain signatures on documents. They have modernized the signature process and helped companies avoid the costly overhead of obtaining a hand-written physical signature. With signatures being the most common way to authorize contracts, it’s a necessity that Chainlink oracles give smart contracts access to leading e-signature companies like DocuSign.\n\nChainlink can benefit the e-signature industry in two ways: attesting to the e-signature and relaying it on-chain, or providing existing e-signature solutions with access to external data as a means of making their contract solutions more dynamic. FirmaChain, a blockchain-based digital signature and contracting solution, is using Chainlink oracles to allow its digital contracts to execute according to real-world data and events, like checking the authenticity of a driver’s license before approving a car rental. Another example is EthSign, an automated contract settlement framework where users can define off-chain data sources through Chainlink oracles as well as their respective trigger conditions.\n\nAnother verifiable way to authorize a smart contract is through biometric data, such as a fingerprint or a retinal eye scan. Since biometrics are uniquely identifiable to a specific person, they can be an effective way to verify someone’s identity as long as there is a reliable database or source to cross-reference it against. Chainlink oracles can both deliver the biometric data to the smart contract and connect it to different off-chain databases to verify authenticity.\n\nUsing trusted hardware and/or advanced cryptography, Chainlink oracles securely handle the private account information of external systems and applications. This enables smart contracts to directly verify credentials, such as whether someone has the proper amount of funds or possesses a specific security key. Once Chainlink oracles relay the confirmation on-chain, the smart contract can trigger execution and settlement of funds. Bringing credentials on-chain can also be especially effective for verifying inputs before exchanging valuable assets.\n\nInstitutions leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology often require additional infrastructure to ensure full regulatory compliance in regards to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. This requires the use of an external oracle to provide the data regarding the identity and full history of funds being transferred.\n\nCoinfirm is one example of a blockchain analytics firm that is using Chainlink oracles to bring data from its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution on-chain. This provides a plug-and-play solution for users wanting to add compliance to any on-chain application through real-time verification by an oracle network. Additionally, CipherTrace launched DeFi compliance oracle service on Chainlink to enable DEXs and other DeFi applications to abide by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions requirements by providing source-signed compliance data on-chain.\n\nBlockchains still have a steep learning curve for many people, particularly around dealing with long hexadecimal addresses. In order to improve user experience, oracles are being used to help transform hexadecimal addresses into human-readable names like “chad.crypto”.\n\nOne example is Unstoppable Domains, an on-chain domain name repository using Chainlink oracles to tie a user’s Twitter social media account to their human-readable on-chain address in a verifiable and transparent manner. This allows anyone to verify that a blockchain domain is tied to a user’s social media account before sending them funds.\n\nTo ensure the integrity and proper functioning of smart contract applications, developers may want to verify whether or not a protocol has undergone one or multiple security audits before sending it funds. Using an oracle, users can get on-demand verification of audit results directly on-chain, opening up use cases like automatic checks before certain transactions, such as high-value ones, or when acting as a trusted custodian for other users funds.\n\nCybersecurity firm Hacken will use Chainlink oracles to bring their security data on-chain regarding smart contract audits, penetration tests on centralized exchanges, bug bounties, and more. This data can then be utilized by smart contracts to prevent interactions with dangerous and/or unaudited smart contracts.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is another method a user can leverage to secure their online accounts, requiring an additional layer of verification beyond a username and password. This increase of security prevents unauthorized access to confidential information, as well as preventing the transferring of funds without multiple verifications. With Chainlink oracles, smart contracts are able to be enhanced with 2FA functionalities, directly protecting a user’s cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nDigital Bridge is an example of a project using Chainlink oracles to bring 2FA security to smart contracts on the Matic Network. By connecting to a high-availability 2FA API authentication service, Chainlink enables users to create a defense-in-depth strategy for their on-chain funds, preventing unauthorized transfers even in the event that their private key is stolen.\n\nAll types of intellectual property, from royalties like copyrights and trademarks to license fees for patents, can be turned into smart contracts. Chainlink can be used to check IP databases for ownership verification, verify off-chain credentials before IP access, and facilitate payments from the user to the IP owner. Smart contracts could even tokenize partial ownership of IP and divvy out payments according to a person’s share percentage. Large enterprises such as Microsoft and EY have shown this to be a practical solution that significantly reduces operational inefficiencies in the rights and royalties management process.\n\nOpen-source technology is growing in popularity, and can benefit from more expansive bounty programs to incentivize contributions. However, verification of a contributor’s work and payments to them are often manual processes, raising costs and delaying payout timelines. Chainlink oracles can be used to track contributions on public code repositories such as GitHub and unlock a payment escrow once predefined test cases for a bounty have passed without errors.\n\nWhile society may not agree on various issues, an initiative most people can get behind is creating more transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government institutions. Blockchains provide society with new infrastructure for tracking and executing government processes, smart contracts offer tamperproof guardrails on how governments are allowed to take action, and oracles allow for the use of objective data to trigger the execution of those actions as opposed to always leaving it up to centralized interpretation. Oracles are one of the most important ingredients to realizing the value of smart contracts within government processes, as they both provide a bridge to connect legacy infrastructure to blockchains and serve as the final triggers for executing the contract.\n\nEnterprise use of smart contracts will require new forms of automated regulatory compliance. While some restrictions can be hardcoded into the smart contract’s programmatic code, governments can also make use of oracles as a way of extracting metadata from the smart contract or requiring external approval from a government-run oracle before broadcasting a transaction.\n\nAn example of a Compliance Oracle was outlined in the Project Whitney Case Study initiated by the Depository and Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the post-trade financial services company that settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States. As stated in the case study, a compliance oracle is a “Dynamic rules engine that enables issuers and investors to maintain compliance throughout a securities lifecycle by approving/rejecting transactions. When a transaction is approved, the stock record is updated, and the movement of tokens on-chain occurs.”Given the recent polarization around election results, there is increasing demand for secure, tamper-proof voting solutions that establish integrity in the election process. While it may take time to overhaul government voting systems, one can envision a simplified scenario where a vote can be cast on-chain using a private key, an oracle can verify the ID of the person from multiple approved sources in a privacy-preserving manner via DECO, and, if they match, then a confirmation is published on-chain where it is stored as an immutable record that can be cryptographically verified by anyone. This leads to the creation of a more sustainable democracy through tamper-proof voting, aligning with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.\n\nSmart contracts can be used to bring more efficiency and integrity to the issuance of government certificates, permits, and deeds. Oracles can be used to generate certificates more autonomously, such as through using DECO to verify a person’s credentials before sending them a tokenized document such as a permit. Using a system like DECO allows the smart contract to query a set of authoritative sources in a privacy-preserving manner. Such an automated process could save billions of dollars in government spending.\n\nHybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain code and real-world data from IoT sensors and satellite data can be leveraged to create fully traceable, transparent, and automated incentivization systems that directly reward individuals, companies, and governments for taking part in sustainable practices and fighting against both climate change and mitigating its harmful effects. This can include the creation of tokenized carbon offsets, regenerative agriculture, and even the monitoring of consumption to reward those who stay within their means.\n\nThe Green World Campaign is an example of one project that aims to use hybrid smart contracts to incentivize regenerative agriculture in a reforestation program created in collaboration with IC3 and funded by a Chainlink Community Grant. This program uses satellite remote sensing data that is fed on-chain by Chainlink oracles to reward stewards of regenerative agriculture who help reforest degraded land. By incentivizing carbon drawdown, their plan is to eventually plant billions of trees and help raise the living and health standards of those in developing regions.\n\nWhile slightly more advanced, it’s not hard to imagine a future where satellite imagery is used in combination with IoT networks and drones to gather data on external activities like a construction project. Through artificial intelligence, the data could then be analyzed and cross-referenced with past projects to determine the completion percentage of a project. Chainlink oracles could relay that data to an on-chain smart contract to issue completion-based payouts to construction companies, solving a major problem in delayed cash flows for companies performing large, time-consuming projects.\n\nDuring a fireside chat between Chainlink Labs Chief Scientist Ari Juels and Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Ari discussed his early work with PhD student Sishan Long on a project called AIRS: Automated Incentives for Reforestation Stewardship. AIRS aims to incentivize stewardship of the environment by consistently taking in satellite data (carbon capture capacity, the ability to sequester carbon, carbon sync capability, etc.) and monitoring its state over time using trusted execution environments. The idea is for entities like governments and NGOs to pour money into the smart contract, which then gets dispensed to the people who are responsible for maintaining and expanding this very important carbon sink, incentivizing sustainable practices.\n\nOn-chain applications do not have access to a secure Random Number Generator (RNG) due to the deterministic nature of blockchain networks. Using the on-chain blockhash can result in manipulation from blockchain miners/validators who discard blocks with unfavorable hashes and can “re-roll the dice”, ultimately changing the RNG value. Naive off-chain solutions are opaque and provide no proof that the RNG value produced is legitimate and has not been manipulated by either the data source or oracle node. Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) overcomes these issues by providing smart contracts with a secure source of randomness backed by a cryptographic proof that cannot be manipulated by oracle nodes, users, or development teams.\n\nChainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node’s pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. Consuming smart contracts will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof. This provides users with automated and publicly verifiable assurances directly on-chain that each smart contract application using Chainlink VRF for randomness is provably fair. Verifiable randomness can be used across a wide of use cases including dynamic NFTs, on-chain gaming applications, off-chain systems, and beyond.\n\nSmart contracts are pieces of code that run deterministically on the blockchain. However, they are “asleep” by default and must be “awoken” by some external entity to perform on-chain functions and change contract states. Chainlink Automation provides smart contract developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a solution to this problem through a highly reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient decentralized network of nodes that can automate any smart contract function and perform regular contract maintenance.\n\nChainlink Automation can be used for a wide range of smart contract functions including executing limit orders on a DEX, minting new tokens when a reserve increases in value, harvesting yield from a vault, rebasing elastic supply tokens, triggering automated trading strategies, liquidating undercollateralized loans, releasing vesting tokens, topping up token balances falling below a threshold, and much more.\n\nIt’s unlikely that one blockchain will come to dominate the entire smart contract market, especially when considering throughput limitations, jurisdictional differences, and specialization of chains. Such a multi-blockchain universe means that blockchains must cross-communicate with one another. However, due to their inherent security properties, blockchains cannot natively access data on other blockchain networks, a very similar issue to the oracle problem. Chainlink oracles can be used to bridge this gap by reading data on one blockchain and writing the results on another as a means of triggering some type of cross-chain interactions and/or simply an on-chain transaction on the chain requesting the information.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard that will provide a secure, decentralized, and expandable cross-chain messaging solution that will enable smart contracts on any blockchain network to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across any other blockchain network. In addition to generalized message passing between chains, CCIP enables the creation of cross-chain bridges such as the Programmable Token Bridge reference implementation, allowing for the transfers of tokens along with commands to any other blockchain network.\n\nWhile Chainlink oracles are commonly recognized for their ability to fetch and deliver data from the real world on-chain in a reliable and secure manner, they can also perform various off-chain computations including the ordering of transactions. Chainlink’s development of Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) will allow decentralized applications to mitigate Miner Extractable Value (MEV) by ensuring transaction ordering cannot be manipulated by miners as a means of siphoning value from users. Additionally, by preventing front-running attacks, gas costs can be drastically reduced and DEXs can become more trustworthy (e.g. trades are honored according to fairer rules like their arrival in the mempool).\n\nIn order to prevent spam attacks, transactions on smart contract-enabled blockchains require the gas fees in the native token to pay for the cost miners expend to validate a transaction. However, the market that determines gas prices happens off-chain and thus smart contracts require an oracle to fetch the current cost per unit of gas.\n\nAn example of this in action is ETHA Lend, an on-chain yield optimizer that uses the Chainlink gas price oracle to help build and execute algorithmically optimized yield strategies for LPs. Smart contracts can also use this gas price oracle to create gas price financial products and other financial products designed for hedging against blockchain network congestion and high transaction costs.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain-based public sales, many projects are looking for ways to fairly choose the order of sale participants beyond the common “first come, first serve”’ model, which can be easily manipulated. Initially popularized by centralized exchanges, there is an increasing shift towards a randomized-based selection of sale participants within smart contracts.\n\nOne example is Centaur, a DeFi platform that uses Chainlink VRF to determine the participants in an on-chain public sale. Based on a list of addresses accumulated before the sale, Chainlink VRF determines in a verifiable and fair manner which addresses from that list are allowed to participate in the on-chain public sale.\n\nAnother example is Get Protocol, a blockchain-based event ticketing solution that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly determine a digital waiting line for in-demand concerts and events. This provides users with an equal opportunity to obtain tickets, in a manner they can independently verify on-chain as unbiased.\n\nSome protocols use unpredictability as a form of security, for example by randomly choosing validators for block production. An insecure source of randomness would allow malicious actors to overly insert themselves into the process and manipulate the production of blocks, possibly even bringing the network to a halt. Chainlink VRF can be used as a tamper-proof source of randomness to fairly choose validators each time a block of transactions needs to be produced, protecting blockchain networks from a large category of key attack vectors.\n\nAs a generalized framework for building decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink provides developers the tools they need to connect their smart contract applications to any real-world data or events required for their use case. While the use cases listed above are not an exhaustive list, as there is an infinite number of smart contract use cases made possible by Chainlink, we believe they provide a starting point for developers who are interested in building new innovative decentralized applications.\n\nIf you’re a developer and want to quickly get your smart contract application connected to Chainlink oracles, visit the developer documentation and join the technical discussion in Discord.

    "summary": "Learn how to mint your own NFT via three different methods: Using OpenSea, writing your own smart contract, and via Etherscan.\n\n",
    "content": "NFTs are fast becoming a vital type of digital asset. The rise in their popularity signals that blockchains are moving beyond cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, governance tokens, and utility tokens to break into today’s cultural zeitgeist—with these unique digital collectibles seeing growing adoption across media, entertainment, music, sports, and more.\n\nWhether you’re a creator looking for new ways to monetize your creativity using cutting-edge technology or a pioneering collector breaking into Web3 for the first time, this simple, step-by-step tutorial teaches you how to mint (create) your first NFT.\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you should already be familiar with the MetaMask (or any other OpenSea-compatible) wallet.\n\nBefore looking into how to create an NFT, it’s essential to understand exactly what an NFT is. NFTs are non-fungible, or unique, tokens, which means that no two NFTs are ever the same, even if they might look the same. This is because each NFT has a unique identifier. You can think of this like a barcode. Even if the same image is attached to two different NFTs, you’ll be able to tell the difference by their barcodes.\n\nThis is also what makes NFT extremely powerful for creators. In the past, you could copy digital art endlessly, and there was no way to tell one file from the other. Now there is—and that’s just scratching the surface of what makes NFTs a paradigm-shifting technology.\n\nTo dive deeper into the technical aspects of NFTs and what they can do, check out What Is an NFT?Minting an NFT means creating a unique token on a blockchain. Only after minting an NFT is the digital collectible stored on the blockchain.\n\nIt’s important to know what is being stored during the minting process. It could be an entire work of art, in which case the entirety of the NFT and its metadata is stored “on-chain,” or it could be a reference to information stored off-chain using a tool like IPFS. Regardless of the data being stored, the simplest way to think about minting is as the process of creating an NFT.\n\nSo you’ve decided you’d like to mint your first NFT. How do you get started? You could use an NFT marketplace like OpenSea or mint directly onto the blockchain via a smart contract. Let’s take a look at both methods.\n\nMinting an NFT on OpenSea is straightforward. It consists of two steps.\n\nNote, if you don’t have a collection, you may need to create that first. There are instructions in the “Collection” section to help.\n\nIf you want a more programmatic approach to minting NFTs, deploying a smart contract to a blockchain like Ethereum could be a better option.\n\nIf you come across a contract for an NFT project and want to mint directly from a tool like Etherscan, you can do that if the contract has been verified. The checkmark next to “Contract” is the first thing to look for. This means the contract is verified.\n\nIf the contract has been verified, you should be able to interact with it from Etherscan directly.\n\nYou’ll need to select “Contract” then “Write Contract.” Once there, you should see the functions you can interact with. You’ll be looking for the mint function; it might be named safeMint. After you connect your wallet and provide your address, you should be able to mint the NFT to your wallet. Follow along with the GIF below to get started.\n\nBuilding smart contracts to mint NFTs is a more in-depth topic. The tutorials below will walk you through the various processes.\n\nThe cost of minting an NFT depends on the method you use and the state of the network at the time you’re minting. If cost is a concern, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea have a “lazy minting” function, which enables you to sell an NFT before it’s minted—with the buyer paying the cost.\n\nSelling an NFT is simple if you use an NFT marketplace. For example, OpenSea, Nifty GateWay, Rarible, SuperRare, and X2Y2 are all prominent NFT marketplaces many NFT creators use to sell NFTs.\n\nThe NFT minting process is very similar for other blockchains if you mint an NFT through marketplaces like OpenSea. However, there may be blockchains that are not supported by a specific marketplace. A good place to find more information on which blockchains are supported is a marketplace’s help page.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about building a successful NFT project, check out this guide, which details the essential steps and considerations for getting your project off the ground—NFT projects are more than the code behind the images.\n\nTo learn more, visit chain.link, subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter, and follow Chainlink on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit.\n\n",

    "summary": "From ideation and fundraising to launch, explore these resources and learn everything you need to know to launch a Web3 startup.\n\n",
    "content": "Launching a Web3 startup can be a daunting task. Compared to their Web2 counterparts, Web3 founders lack access to the abundance of knowledge and resources that come with an established sector. But given the nascent nature of the Web3 industry, there’s immense opportunity and an open frontier of ideas for founders to build and find success with. This is the Web3 startup tradeoff—building a standout Web3 startup requires that founders venture into previously unexplored territories that only a select few have successfully navigated. There is more opportunity and fresh ground to explore, but less guidance on offer as a result.\n\nHowever, there are still some resources for founders to draw from, plus the examples of those who have gone before. This post provides founders with the most recent information, guidance, and resources on how to effectively launch, fund, grow, and scale a Web3 startup.\n\nWeb3 products are often software products, meaning founders can leverage the same lean-startup model that has proven successful in Web2 technology companies. The core of this model can be broken down into three iterative processes—build, measure, and learn. By following these steps, startups can minimize the time and effort spent on product development to quickly find product-market fit.\n\nDiscover how to effectively gauge demand and build Web3 products that users actually want by reading this blog.\n\nBut what does it mean to actually achieve product-market fit, and how do you measure it? This article dives into the theory behind finding product-market fit and provides time-tested conceptual frameworks for Web3 startups to understand the type of market they’re in, whether they’ve achieved product-market fit and how to measure it, and what to do next.\n\nRaising funds is one of the toughest but most important challenges for a Web3 startup that’s just getting off the ground. How much to raise, where to look for funds, what investors are looking for, and how to effectively showcase your startup’s potential are all important questions that Web3 founders should be asking—and the answers depend on the specific vertical, the stage of the startup, and more.\n\nThe good news is that Web3 startups have more fundraising opportunities than ever before, from blockchain grants and crowdfunding options to traditional VC investment. This introductory post provides the context you need to set yourself up for fundraising success and put yourself in the shoes of an investor.\n\nOnce you’ve read the article above, browse through this curated list of Web3 fundraising resources to understand the options that are out there for Web3 startups and choose the ones that are best for your startup’s goals.\n\nMarketing tactics are continuously evolving in Web3 as startups find new ways to attract and retain users. Given their community focus and decentralized nature, Web3 startups often deploy marketing strategies that can’t be replicated by their Web2 counterparts. However, founders must carefully consider the tactics that best suit their startup.\n\nDive deep into the landscape of Web3 marketing and explore the many strategies, tactics, tools, and metrics that startups must consider when creating a robust marketing framework that can quickly adapt to changing conditions.\n\nWho are your startup’s customers? In this regard, marketing and product development go hand in hand. When considering the very early stages of a Web3 startup’s go-to-market strategy, it’s important to nail down the key elements needed for a successful launch. This depends entirely on a startup’s desired community.\n\nThis article breaks down Web3 opportunities into different verticals and analyzes the go-to-market strategies of successful Web3 projects in order to provide founders with a clear understanding of how and why Web3 marketing is different.\n\nBuilding communities of developers is mission-critical to protocol success. They form the backbone of a project’s ecosystem and can be called upon to build additional utility that your team might not have the time or resources for.\n\nEven if your project doesn’t need a developer community, the tactics and theoretical frameworks mentioned in this blog post will be handy for any Web3 startup that wants to build a robust community of any kind.\n\nLaunching a Web3 startup is not an easy endeavor, but it can pay dividends for those that build standout products and have a clear plan to scale.\n\nDon’t attempt to memorize all of the frameworks, strategies, and tactics mentioned in this article. Instead, choose the domain that’s most relevant to your current challenge and refer back to this post when you need guidance on specific topics, like product development or fundraising. Ultimately, no guide or resource can provide you with an impenetrable blueprint for success. Building a startup is, and likely always will be, more of an art than a science—these resources simply give you a canvas to start drawing on.\n\n",

    "summary": "In this technical tutorial, learn how to deploy smart contracts on the Solana blockchain that use Chainlink Price Feeds to access secure market data.\n\n",
    "content": "If you want to learn how to develop Solana smart contracts and programs, then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nSolana is an emerging high-performance, permissionless blockchain that offers fast, cheap, and scalable transactions and supports smart contracts being built with the Rust, C++, and C programming languages.\n\nIn this technical article, we’ll go through examples of writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Solana Devnet cluster, as well as how to use Chainlink Price Feeds in your Solana smart contracts.\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain capable of thousands of transactions per second and sub-second block times. It achieves this via a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism that makes use of a new innovative cryptographic function called Proof of History.\n\nProof of History (PoH) establishes a cryptographically verifiable order of events (in this case transactions) over time via the use of a high-frequency verifiable delay function, or VDF. Essentially this means PoH is like a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes. Much like how an ancient water clock can record the passage of time by observing rising water levels, Proof of History’s sequential outputs of constant hashed blockchain state give a verifiable order of events over time.\n\nThis helps the performance of the network by allowing the ordered events to then be processed in parallel, as opposed to a traditional blockchain scenario where a single process verifies and bundles up all the transactions to be included in the next block.\n\nA simple analogy would be to imagine a large 100-piece puzzle. In a normal scenario it would take one or more people a certain amount of time to complete the puzzle. But imagine if beforehand the puzzle pieces were all stamped with a number corresponding to their position, from top left to bottom right of the puzzle, and laid out in a line in sequential order. Because the exact order of puzzle pieces and their position in the puzzle is known beforehand, the puzzle can be solved quicker by having multiple people focus on a section each. This is the effect that having a verifiable sequence of events over time has on the consensus mechanism; it allows the processing to be broken up into multiple parallel processes.\n\nSolana offers a different smart contract model to traditional EVM-based blockchains. In traditional EVM-based chains, contract code/logic and state are combined into a single contract deployed on-chain. With Solana, a smart contract (or program) is read-only or stateless and contains just program logic. Once deployed, smart contracts can be interacted with by external accounts. The accounts that interact with the programs store data related to program interaction. This creates a logical separation of state (accounts) and contract logic (programs). This is the crucial difference between Solana and EVM-based smart contracts. Accounts on Ethereum are not the same as accounts on Solana. Solana accounts can store data (including wallet information) as opposed to Ethereum accounts, which are references to people’s wallets.\n\nIn addition to this, Solana offers a CLI and JSON RPC API that can be used by decentralized applications to interact with the Solana blockchain. They can also use one of the existing SDKs, which allow clients to talk to the blockchain and Solana programs.\n\nIn this section, you’ll create and deploy your first ‘hello world’ Solana program, written in Rust.\n\nThe following should be installed before proceeding:The HelloWorld program is a smart contract that prints output to the console and counts the number of times the program has been called for a given account, storing the number on-chain. Let’s break down the code into separate sections.\n\nThe first section defines some standard Solana program parameters and defines an entry point for the program (the ‘process_instruction’ function). In addition to this, it uses borsh for serializing and deserializing parameters being passed to and from the deployed program.\n\nThe process_instruction function accepts the program_id, which is the public key where the program is deployed to, and accountInfo, which is the account to say hello to.\n\nThe ProgramResult is where the main logic of the program resides. In this case, it simply prints a message, then selects the accounts by looping through ‘accounts’. However, in our example there will only be one account.\n\nNext, the program checks to see if the account has permission to modify the data for the specified account.\n\nFinally, the function takes the existing account’s stored number, increases the value by one, writes the result back, and displays a message.\n\nThe first step is to clone the repository.\n\nOnce this is done, you can then set your current environment to devnet. This is the test network for Solana developers writing and testing smart contracts.\n\nNext, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet. Take note: this is an insecure method for storing keys and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter in a passphrase for security reasons.\n\nNow that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your smart contract. This command requests SOL tokens into your newly generated account:You’re now ready to build the hello world program. You can build it by running the following commandOnce the program has been built, you can then deploy it to devnet. The previous command’s output will give you the command that you need to run, but it should look something similar to the following:The end result is that you have successfully deployed the hello world program to devnet with an assigned program Id. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer.\n\nTo interact with the deployed program, the hello-world repository contains a simple client. This client is written in Typescript using the Solana web3.js SDK and the Solana RPC API.\n\nThe client entry point is the main.ts file, which performs a number of tasks in a specific order, most of which are contained within the hello_world.ts file.\n\nFirst, the client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling the ‘establishConnection’ functionIt then calls the ‘establishPayer’ function to ensure there is an account available to pay for transactions, and creates one if required.\n\nThe client then calls the ‘checkProgram’ function, which loads the keypair of the deployed program from ./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json and uses the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn’t exist, the client stops with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner to store the program state, which in this case is the number of times the program has been executed.\n\nThe client then builds up and sends a ‘hello’ transaction to the program by calling the ‘sayHello’ function. The transaction contains an instruction that holds the public key of the helloworld program account to call, and the account to which the client wishes to say hello to. Each time the client performs this transaction to an account, the program increments a count in the destination account’s data storage.\n\nFinally, the client queries the account’s data to retrieve the current number of times the account has had the sayHello transaction called, by calling ‘reportGreetings’Before you can run the client to read data from your deployed program, you need to install the client dependencies.\n\nOnce this is done, you can start the client.\n\nYou should see output showing your program successfully being executed, and it should display the number of times the account has been greeted. Subsequent runs should increase this number.\n\nCongratulations, you’ve deployed and interacted with a Solana smart contract on the devnet network! Now we’ll dive into another example Solana program and client, except this time we’ll make use of Chainlink Price Feeds.\n\nThe ecosystem of DeFi apps on Solana is growing at an accelerating rate. In order to power basic DeFi mechanisms and execute key on-chain functions, such as issuing loans at fair market prices or liquidating undercollateralized positions, these dApps need access to highly reliable and high-quality market data.\n\nSolana has integrated Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana Devnet, offering developers highly decentralized, high-quality, high-speed price reference data updates for building hybrid smart contracts.\n\nWhen combined with Solana’s ability to support up to 65,000 transactions per second and its extremely low transaction fees, Chainlink Price Feeds have the potential to empower DeFi protocol infrastructure that can compete with traditional financial systems in terms of trade execution and risk management quality.\n\nIn this next code example, we’ll deploy and interact with a Solana program that makes use of Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana devnet cluster.\n\nThe Solana Starter Kit is a pre-packaged repository that contains a smart contract that simply connects to a Chainlink Price Feed account on devnet, and retrieves and stores the latest price of the specified price pair into an account, which is then read by an off-chain client. The starter kit uses the Anchor framework, a framework that helps abstract some of the complexities with building smart contracts on Solana.\n\nChainlink Price Feeds on Solana all utilize a single program, with each individual price feed being a separate account that stores price updates using the program. The way this demo works is an off-chain client passes in an account to the on-chain program, the on-chain program then obtains the latest price for the specified price feed, and stores the value in the passed in account. Finally, the off-chain client then reads the price data from the account.\n\nThe first section of the the smart contract consists of normal includes and declaring using the Anchor framework. It also declares the program ID as required by Anchor. In addition to this, a struct is defined for storing price feed answers into the passed in account, as well as a `fmt` function for formatting the price data retrieved.\n\nNext, the program declares a `chainlink_solana_demo` module to be used for obtaining price data, which contains the `execute` function.\n\nThe `execute` function is the part of the program that contains the main logic for the smart contract. It retrieves the latest round data from the specified feed address by calling the `latest_round_data` function from the chainlink-solana package, which gets imported from GitHub via the Cargo.toml file. The function finishes by formatting and storing the price against the specified account passed into the program, and writing the result out to the program output.\n\nThe first step is to clone the repository.\n\nOnce this is done, you can install the required dependencies, including the Anchor framework.\n\nNote for Apple M1 chipsets: You will need to perform an extra step to get the Anchor framework installed manually from source, as the NPM package only support x86_64 chipsets currently, please run the following command to install it manually:Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet cluster. Again, this is an insecure method for storing keys, and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for security reasons.\n\nNow that you’ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your program. This command requests SOL tokens for your newly generated account. We will need to call this twice, because the Devnet faucet is limited to 2 SOL, and we need approximately 4 SOL.\n\nYou’re now ready to build the Chainlink Solana Demo program using the Anchor framework!The build process generates the keypair for your program’s account. Before you deploy your program, you must add this public key to your lib.rs file, as it’s it’s required by programs that make use of Anchor. To do this, you need to get the keypair from the ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json file that Anchor generated using the following command:The next step is to edit the lib.rs file and replace the keypair in the declare_id!() definition with the value you obtained from the previous step:Next, you also need to insert the obtained Program ID value into the Anchor.toml file in the chainlink_solana_demo devnet definitionFinally, because you updated the source code with the generated program ID, you need to rebuild the program again, and then it can be deployed to devnetOnce you have successfully deployed the program, the terminal output will specify the program ID of the program, it should match the value you inserted into the lib.rs file and the Anchor.toml file. Once again, take note of this Program ID, as it will be required when executing the client. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer.\n\nTo interact with the deployed program, the Chainlink Solana Demo repository contains a client written in JavaScript using the Anchor framework and the Solana web3 API.\n\nThe client is a JavaScript script that takes two parameters, a deployed program ID, and a Price Feed account address. It then creates a connection to the deployed program and passes in the specified price feed account and an account to store the retrieved price data. Once the on-chain program execution has completed, it simply reads the price data from the account that was passed into the program.\n\nFirst, the client establishes a connection with the cluster using Anchor and sets up some required parameters, such as pulling in command line arguments and setting of default values:After this, the main function of the client is defined. This is the function that does everything described above. First, it connects to our deployed program using the Anchor framework. It then generates a new account and calls the `execute` function in the deployed program, passing in the following details:The client then waits to get a confirmed transaction and then outputs the program output onto the console. This displays information about the transaction, including the printed output from the on-chain program. Finally, the program reads the price data from the priceFeed account that was passed into the program, and then outputs the value to the console.\n\nThe first step is to set the Anchor environment variables. These are required by the Anchor framework to determine which Provider to use, as well as which Wallet to use for interacting with the deployed program. In this case, we’re setting the value to the default devnet provider URL, and the wallet that we created earlier:Once this is done, we are ready to run the JavaScript client. Be sure to pass the program ID obtained from the previous steps by using the –program flag linking to the json file containing the account that owns the program. We also need to pass in the Chainlink feed address that we wish to query. This can be taken from the Chainlink Solana Feeds page, and the value will be defaulted to the devnet SOL/USD feed address if you don’t specify a value. In this example, we’re explicitly specifying the SOL/USD feed to show how the feed parameter works:You should see output showing the client successfully being executed, and it should display the latest price from the specified price feed, stored in the new account:Solana offers a high-speed, low-cost, scalable blockchain for building smart contracts and decentralized applications. By leveraging Solana smart contracts and Chainlink Price Feeds, developers can create fast, scalable DeFi applications, taking advantage of the high-quality data offered by Chainlink Price Feeds and the high-speed updates available on the Solana blockchain.\n\nTo explore more Chainlink technical tutorials, check out the engineering video tutorials playlist on the official Chainlink YouTube, and visit the Chainlink documentation at docs.chain.link.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "How to find smart contract bugs like the original Polygon MRC20 implementation, what to do when you find them, and what happens next.\n\n",
    "content": "Special thanks to Adrian Hetman, Alejandro Munoz-McDonald, Ivan Benavides, and Leon Spacewalker.\n\nHunting for smart contract bugs can be a ludicrously well-paying job, and it’s also an integral part of protecting the ecosystem from hacks. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing a developer who found a $7 billion dollar bug—and was paid $2.2M for reporting it.\n\nIn this blog, we’re going to go through the bug that this developer found and how it had the potential to compromise $7b in value before offering some strategies and tools that will help you find bugs.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nOn May 31, 2020, the Matic blockchain went live (Matic would later be rebranded as Polygon). Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain known for it’s low gas fees and short block time. The chain has recently begun exploring zk-rollup technology.\n\nIf you take a look at block 0 of Polygon, the absolute first block of the blockchain, also known as its “genesis” block, you’ll see 10 transactions. One of these transactions created a contract called MRC20.\n\nWhat is this contract?When we send a native blockchain token we have to spend gas to do so. So the Polygon team deployed a contract that allows you to sign a transaction to send someone ETH, with someone else able to pay the gas fee for this transaction. Known as a “meta transaction,” this capability was popularized with the introduction of EIP-712.\n\nYou can see that this contract was given almost 10 billion MATIC tokens in order to help facilitate these gasless transactions. However, this clever contract contained a vulnerability that could have potentially been exploited to drain the entire balance!On December 3rd, 2021 the hero of the story, pseudo-anon developer Leon Spacewalker, submitted a report to the Immunefi bug bounty program laying out the details of this exact function. A second hero, who we will just call Whitehat2, also reported the vulnerability a day later.\n\nAround 800,000 MATIC tokens were stolen before the chain was finally forked, rolled back, and fixed December 5th, 2021.\n\nThis leaves us with some more questions: What was the vulnerability? How did it stay undiscovered for so long? How was it found?Below is the function that facilitates these gasless transactions.\n\nAt first glance, it seems harmless: It takes the signature of the user, how many tokens and who they want to send them to, and any further data, along with an expiration date for the transaction.\n\nIt runs some requires, gets the data hash in order to send the meta transaction, makes sure the data hash hasn’t been used, and does this ecrecovery function.\n\nThis function is essentially a wrapper for the Solidity ecrecover function.\n\nThis function is how we can verify where signed transactions are coming from. You’ll notice, even in the Solidity documentation, it says it will “return zero on error”. The ecrecovery function copied this, and if it had an issue, it would return 0. Which, as many developers know, can be scary. If it returns zero on error, that means that we should check to make sure that the returned address isn’t zero, right?Here’s the actual code:Here’s what should probably be there:So we don’t perform a check on the address to make sure it didn’t result in an error. Not a problem. The last line of code in our transferWithSig function does the actual transfer, surely we will perform some sort of check there, right?The _transferFrom function just called our _transfer function, shown above. You’ll notice it doesn’t check to make sure the from address has enough money.\n\nThis means that someone could send an invalid signature, which would result in a zero address returned from ecrecovery, but the MRC20 contract would still send the to address an amount of money. This is how that 9,999,993,000 MATIC could be drained, since the MRC20 contract sends the money directly from itself!A check to make sure that the from address has enough money for this signed transaction would have prevented this issue.\n\nWhat’s odd to me is that, after the vulnerability laying dormant for almost a year and a half, it was discovered by Leon, another white hat, and a hacker within the span of a few days.\n\nSeems fishy. But the Immunefi team told me this can often happen. Some exploits can become popular based on an article, write-up, or challenge and people then start looking for that vulnerability, resulting in several people finding it at the same time.\n\nBut more likely is that it turns out that polygon verified the contract on Polygonscan around this time – so that was when people really started to look at it.\n\nMaybe there is more to the story, but maybe not.\n\nIn any case, let’s use this bug as a teachable moment and look at some of the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find bugs, helping protect the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nNow, we are going to learn the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find these vulnerabilities and claim bug bounties. This list of tips assumes you already know the basics of smart contracts, so yes, learning Solidity is a prerequisite.\n\nUse these superpowers for ethical hacking, and please remember to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.\n\nA lot of the work of finding vulnerabilities comes from looking at the code and running tools like slither. For this $2.2M payout, Leon said he was able to find the bug by looking line-by-line at the smart contract code, so remember, finding vulnerabilities is often a huge manual lift!In addition to the practical tips below, Leon’s biggest takeaway was for smart contract bug hunters to “find your edge,” but what does he mean by that? Typically, this means finding that thing that sets you apart from other hackers. We as a community need to cover every corner of the smart contract space, so find a section that you are specifically good at and excel.\n\nHere are the seven strategies and tips to help find your edge, to make you a successful smart contract bug hunter.\n\nThe first way you can find bugs is to know every inch of how a protocol works. This is one of the first skills every smart contract bug hunter needs to be learn: the ability to understand a protocol end to end.\n\nGo through docs, try to reimplement a protocol yourself, and view transactions through that protocol on a block explorer.\n\nLeon said this strategy works for other hunters but not him. He focuses on the next three, but it’s important for every bug hunter to be able to do this.\n\nAn easier approach to hunting for bugs is to find a bug that not a lot of people know about and try to see which protocols have implemented it.\n\nThis strategy takes a lot of research, as there are a lot of people working on exposing bugs to the general public.\n\nYou first need to understand all the basic smart contract exploits, and then their advanced versions. You need to be aware of best practices and see if there are protocols that have not followed them.\n\nOnce you find a smart contract bug you think a lot of projects might not have protected against, start searching for that bug. Get really familiar with this new bug and how to find it. And be sure to write a blog or some kind of post to help other smart contract developers who run into this bug protect themselves.\n\nProjects that want bug hunters to look at their smart contracts need to sign up for bug bounty programs like Immunefi. And you’ll want to be one of the first developers to find the new bounties. If you start looking at a contract before other hunters, you’ll have more time to find a bug than other hunters.\n\nThere are a few ways to be fast—one of the ways Leon was able to find the smart contract vulnerability before others was by having notifications on for the Immunifi updates Discord channel. He received a notification anytime a new project came in, or a project was updated. Tools like this can help you get to digging into code before anyone else does.\n\nAnother way Leon was able to get an edge, was traversing community forums, and finding out they were thinking about submitting a bug. He’d then start looking at the smart contracts even before the bounty was approved. This gave him way more time to look at a contract than other developers, since they would wait for a bug bounty to be submitted.\n\nBug hunters use tools like the VSCode Solidity visual developer extension, Hardhat, Foundry, Brownie, Dune, Etherscan, plus a host of others.\n\nA typical bug hunting strategy might be loading up VSCode, adding the code to VSCode with the Solidity visual extension, and going line by line looking for common bugs or bad best practices.\n\nAfter finding a weakness, setting up a testing environment to run tests on the contract is a good next step. You can often reuse a lot of the tests the developers of the protocol originally used.\n\nNot much else to say here. Audit firms make mistakes. Many of the projects Leon found vulnerabilities for had been audited by top firms.\n\nUsing the skills we talked about in this blog can be the difference for you to find these issues!One of the biggest advantages in finding your edge is specializing in a specific niche. If you understand one area incredibly well, you’ll have the advantage of knowing how all the functions interact with each other. If you’re a phenomenal smart contract vulnerability expert but don’t know anything about DeFi, it’ll be hard to find vulnerabilities in DeFi contracts. For example, a lot of developers understand code, but don’t understand financial primitives.\n\nYou could get incredibly good at understanding decentralized exchanges, borrowing protocols, or maybe just NFTs!If you can become a master of security and a master of a certain vertical within Web3, you’ll be well-positioned to have a massive leg up on everyone else looking for bugs.\n\nI hope this piece is useful to you in your smart contract bug-hunting journey. If you want to learn more about security when writing your smart contracts, be sure to check out Top Ten DeFi Security Best Practices.\n\nAnd, as always, I hope to see you out there building and keeping the ecosystem a little safer.\n\nMRC20 contract.\n\nImmunefi writeup.\n\nChange to Polygon contracts.\n\nPrevious Polygon contracts.\n\nEcrecovery challenge.\n\nThe opinions expressed within this post are solely the author’s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.\n\n",

    "content": "Definition: The verifiable web uses blockchain technology, decentralized computing, and cryptography to enforce contractual obligations, provide greater transparency into how systems work, and give users more control over their data, identities, and assets.\n\nIn early civilizations, truth was based on myth. Observations of worldly phenomena were wrapped in symbolic narratives, religious beliefs, and ancient wisdom. Over time, humanity began to value objective measurements and reasoning, birthing disciplines such as science, mathematics, and logic.\n\nAfter the invention of the written word and, later, the printing press, books and documents captured the world’s information in written form, from academic literature and legal contracts to statistics and opinionated analysis. Then, in the twentieth century, phones, computers, and the Internet started a digital revolution in how information was created, distributed, and verified, with supercomputers now performing large-scale computations on complex data sets and billions of users across the globe generating, sharing, and talking about content every day in real-time.\n\nNow, with a simple Internet connection, anyone in the world can instantly access a seemingly infinite flow of information. But while individuals are now empowered to consume and share more information than ever before, high-velocity, high-volume information scattered across a variety of applications poses extraordinary challenges: How can an everyday user make sense of such a vast, complex, and sometimes contradictory information landscape? Information warfare and advancements in AI are only compounding this problem.\n\nInformation is the basis for sound decision-making by humans, institutions, and systems, and we need a better foundation for obtaining and evaluating it. This new foundation starts by increasing people’s ability to verify the source of information, the method used to calculate it and the integrity of the systems used to do so, and the historical reputation of these sources, methods, and systems. Doing so will require the creation of a more advanced informational and digital age powered by cryptographic truth. We call this the verifiable web.\n\nIn the established web model, the Internet is shared networking infrastructure that enables communication between computers via online applications. Each online application handles its own computing (executing code), storage (storing code and data used and produced), and management (updating code and maintaining a successful business) by either running it in-house or outsourcing it to a centralized company. Users of applications are then responsible for establishing a connection to the Internet in order to interact with the online application, generally by paying for a data or Internet plan.\n\nThe problem with this model is it directly or indirectly gives centralized entities— whether it’s the application or Internet Service Provider (ISP)—extensive control over online data, computing, and/or networking. This means how the application works can be arbitrarily changed at any time—a social media company quietly changing its algorithm, for example. It also means that user data and connectivity can be arbitrarily censored, omitted, or monetized for personal gain, oftentimes with little user oversight or awareness of how it’s being done. As a result, the user has to trust the application and Internet infrastructure to act in a reliable and honest manner because they have no actual guarantees—just paper promises that take time and money to fight against in court if broken (assuming the user even has access to a high-integrity legal system).\n\nWith the web extending far beyond information-sharing applications to span financial transactions, health management, election systems, supply chain tracking, and more, fixing it means fixing the nature of almost every digital interaction the modern user has. The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nThe verifiable web is not a replacement for the established web but rather an extension of its capabilities. The verifiable web provides applications with a decentralized, cryptographically secure, and verifiably fair environment for running computations, storing data, governing operations, and facilitating networking across systems.\n\nWith some or all of an application’s backend infrastructure run on the verifiable web, users are able to obtain proof and guarantees about the application and its data, such as that it’s manipulation-resistant (secure), always available (reliable), permissionlessly accessible (censorship-resistant), logically sound (accurate), authenticated (genuine), private (privacy), and traceable from inception (provenance).\n\nInstead of requiring users to trust that an online application will keep its commitments, the verifiable web provides technologically enforced guarantees that users can independently check.\n\nBy knowing how an application works and that it cannot arbitrarily change, users can make more informed decisions about whether or not to engage with it and whether to disengage at any point in the future. This is because the user is able to know its state at all times with near-complete certainty, including how it makes decisions, how rules are enforced, how data is generated, and what updates will be made.\n\nThe verifiable web is underpinned by game-theoretical design—using the science of strategy to produce desired outcomes. The verifiable web combines various technologies to create game-theoretical environments where rational participants are incentivized to produce fair outcomes (i.e., it’s deterministic), even in the presence of adversaries. Furthermore, users can inspect these environments to check if they meet their own standards of trust and fairness. In contrast, the established web relies on trust in probabilistic and unverifiable promises made by the centralized entity that owns the application or runs its backend infrastructure.\n\nFor example, central banks manage monetary policy based on subjective assessments while banks manage payment ledgers with relative opaqueness. While there are various reasons for doing so, it is a less predictable process that can create systemic risk. Alternatively, Bitcoin uses a game-theoretical design to incentivize a decentralized network of nodes to manage monetary policy and maintain a payment ledger according to a publicly available set of rules enshrined in the software that nodes on the network run. This provides users with verifiable proof about how the ledger is managed and how difficult it is to tamper with the ledger and alter the monetary policy, ultimately creating more predictable risk management.\n\nThe verifiable web is what crypto is really about—it starts with fixing money and financial markets, before expanding into other industries to bring greater proof and transparency to the digital interactions that determine our lives. If trust in institutions continues to decrease, demand for technologies that provide verifiable proof about the world will only increase. Some of the areas of growing distrust that the verifiable web can help to improve include:Financial markets have historically been subject to boom and bust cycles as a result of mispriced asset valuations and resulting systemic risk due to their cross-dependencies. People want better guarantees that financial markets and assets are as healthy as the official reports state, and that financial services will be honored as agreed upon. The verifiable web can be an important tool in providing a golden record across market infrastructure or forcing timely and in-full financial payments, ultimately creating more stability and reducing systemic risk.\n\nWith the acceleration of AI, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between real and fake images and videos. The spread of fake content is leading to the proliferation of false narratives in society, and, as a side effect, increased skepticism in legitimate sources. The verifiable web can play a key role in authenticating the source of images and videos, such as a camera cryptographically signing a photo/video with a unique private key from an HSM hardware module and then hashing a copy onchain as a tamperproof record of who took the photo/video and when it was taken.\n\nThe acceleration of AI and information warfare has also made it hard to filter misinformation and disinformation and decide who to turn to for unbiased analysis. The verifiable web can not only help create a single, globally accessible source of truth about the origin of information, but it can also help establish methods for verifying the track record of news sources and analysts over time and incentivize sound research and analysis.\n\nAs society has become more educated, it has also become more interested in the source and quality of food and goods. However, it can be difficult to verify the true origin of a good or that it’s authentic, hasn’t been diluted, and is backed by a manufacturer with a reliable track record. The verifiable web can help users track and rate food and goods from inception to the storefront with more certainty.\n\nHaving verifiable proof that a contract will be honored is critical to running a reliable business or purchasing a product (e.g., warranties). Unfortunately, contracts are not always strictly enforced, especially when one side has a clear economic and political advantage over their counterparty. The verifiable web can level the playing field by replacing clauses in digital contracts with technologically enforced guarantees via smart contracts and oracle networks. This can help improve trust between people, businesses, and institutions globally, particularly by making the levers that can dictate the outcome of contracts impossible for any party to tamper with.\n\nObtaining a realistic view of what the public thinks helps institutions and society at large make better decisions. AI, bot farms, and closed-source algorithms make it hard to know whether social consensus derived from online debates, surveys, elections, viewership, and more is real or manipulated. Thus, it’s important for the verifiable web to bring authentication and verifiability to how social consensus is created and gathered, such as by open-sourcing algorithms used in information collection and leveraging manipulation-resistant and privacy-preserving verification systems to prove someone is a unique human without revealing their identity.\n\nBelow is a list of technologies/technological movements that combine to create the verifiable web. New technologies are also likely to emerge as consumers demand more and more verifiable proof and guarantees about their everyday lives.\n\nOpen-source software is software for which the code that defines how it runs is verifiable by anyone. This allows stakeholders using or affected by the software to inspect it before deciding to adopt or update it. As more people independently verify it, the software becomes more secure and trusted to consistently operate in a specific way.\n\nExamples: Linux Operating System, Mozilla Firefox, and Apache Web ServerCryptography involves the use of verifiable mathematical techniques to secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. In a general sense, cryptography is used to conceal and authenticate information by scrambling it with a cipher, which cannot be cracked in any practical sense (e.g., it would require a prohibitive amount of time and investment), even with the most advanced computing technologies. Cryptography is already widely used across the modern Internet to ensure that users are able to interact with each other without worrying about imposters or middlemen intercepting their communications.\n\nExamples: One-Way Hash Functions, Public/Private Key Encryption, and Zero-Knowledge ProofsBlockchains are distributed ledgers that provide verifiable proof that the tracking of asset ownership is accurate and tamperproof, and that the ability to move assets between users is permissionless and always available. Furthermore, the smart contract applications running on blockchains provide verifiable proof that their code will execute exactly as it is stored onchain. This enables businesses to transact and governance processes to be managed in a distributed manner that is transparent and resistant to manipulation by a single entity.\n\nBlockchains make use of a multitude of technological primitives, most notably cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives. As an overview, blockchains use financial rewards and penalties to incentivize a decentralized network of independent nodes to come to an honest consensus about the validity of submitted transactions and to keep the ledger updated and available. Blockchains also use cryptography to authenticate transactions, ensuring they are unique to a specific user. The combination of cryptography and decentralized consensus makes it very difficult to tamper with the network, resulting in a form of cryptographic truth.\n\nExamples: Bitcoin, Aave, and ENSOracles leverage similar primitives of cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives, but for the purpose of creating cryptographic truth around any type of data, computation, or connection between systems. Whereas blockchains are only concerned with verifying the ownership and transfer of tokens or updating smart contracts, oracles can be applied to creating truth and guarantees about anything, such as calculating the fair price of an asset, generating a tamperproof and unbiased random number, or ensuring that an automated task will be completed at a specific time or that value will be securely transferred between systems when a specific event occurs. Oracles can expand cryptographic truth to the verification of almost anything.\n\nExamples: Chainlink Data Streams, Functions, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)Trusted hardware is hardware where the software running inside cannot be tampered with or even observed by either a third party or the hardware operator. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) often generate cryptographic attestations, which give users verifiable proof that the software running inside executed exactly as expected. Although the area still requires more research and development, trusted hardware is an extension of other types of hardware like secure enclaves and hardware security modules (HSMs), which provide a protected environment for storing information or executing code.\n\nExamples: Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and KeystoneAuthenticating that information came from a specific person or company is critical proof for facilitating certain processes. Biometrics provide a way of authenticating that an action was taken by a specific person by verifying a physical feature unique to them. For example, phones use a person’s fingerprint as verifiable proof that they belong to the owner.\n\nExamples: Fingerprint, Iris Recognition, Facial RecognitionWhile truths or proofs may not always be obtainable in real-time, they can be demonstrated over time through the use of reputation systems. Reputation systems are methods of tracking the historical performance of an entity or process, such as a system’s uptime, the accuracy of a data provider, the correctness of an analyst’s predictions, or the reliability of a user in a help forum. The integrity of reputation systems is further verifiable when they cryptographically sign data that they’re tracking onchain, where it cannot be deleted or altered in the future.\n\nExamples: eBay, Stack Exchange, and Ethereum Beacon Chain Validator RankingsAs machine learning algorithms and data collection techniques become more advanced, so too does the ability to analyze complex datasets and come to conclusions with a statistically high degree of confidence.\n\nOne example of this is a project in development by Green World called AIRS, which aims to use satellite remote sensing data with smart contracts to successfully reward stewards of targeted regenerative agriculture. Chainlink oracles are tasked with gathering ground-truthing and satellite data, analyzing it within trusted execution environments for high-trust quantitative metrics, and relaying it to a blockchain to trigger automated payments to stewards. AIRS rewards to stakeholders can take the form of cryptocurrency—readily convertible into local currency—or digital financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of local communities.\n\nThe verifiable web is a much-needed trust anchor for society, whereby vulnerable human decision-making is replaced by unbiased software that enforces honest outcomes and provides verifiable proof of how it arrived at such outcomes. This new superpower enables builders to create applications that are undeniably fair, provably accessible to anyone in the world, and verifiably secure against manipulation. The possibilities are endless, and this paradigm shift couldn’t come at a more pressing time, with society needing verifiable truth about how the world works more than ever.\n\nChainlink is the decentralized computing platform helping power the verifiable web.

Sepolia was initially launched as a proof-of-authority testnet in October 2021 by Ethereum core developers. The network later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to mimic the operating environment of Ethereum mainnet.\n\nSepolia uses a permissioned validator set. Since it’s a relatively new test network with a small state, the network is quick to sync to, and running a node on it requires less storage than on mainnet or other testnets. These features are useful for developers who quickly want to interact with the network directly and run a node.\n\nCompared to other Ethereum testnets, such as Goerli, Sepolia’s total supply of testnet ETH tokens is uncapped, making it more likely that developers using Sepolia will continue to be able to access testnet tokens in the future.\n\nUsing the Chainlink Testnet Faucet, you can request testnet ETH tokens to test your Chainlinked smart contract on Sepolia.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about testing your Chainlinked smart contract, visit the Chainlink Dev Hub.\n\nTo learn more, subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter, and follow Chainlink on Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit.\n\n",

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Why do blockchains and crypto matter? This deep dive explores how blockchain-based technologies are offering new infrastructure for establishing trust across social and economic processes.\n\n",
    "content": "This is Part 1 of a two-part series on the future of trust. Read Part 2, Cryptographic Truth: The Future of Trust-Minimized Computing and Record-Keeping, for a walkthrough of the cryptographic fundamentals that underpin blockchain technology and how Chainlink oracles extend the reach of cryptographic guarantees to the off-chain world.\n\nThe word “trust” is a heavily debated term in the blockchain industry, where engineers often refer to zero-trust interaction systems, trustless transactions, and other trust-minimized technologies. Though personal interpretations of its meaning in blockchain both vary and overlap, trust will always be at the center of understanding what crypto is really about.\n\nDeriving from the Old Norse word traust, meaning “confidence” and also “shelter,” trust has historically referred to the amount of belief one has that people and processes will stay true to their commitments. Trust is foundational to well-functioning societies: high-trust societies generally have increased economic activity and greater social harmony thanks to reduced counterparty risk and fairer dispute resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, trust in the institutions responsible for facilitating core social and economic activities is beginning to break down. For instance, Gallup polls indicate that the U.S. population’s confidence in many of the country’s major institutions has been declining over the past 45 years. While the scope of distrust varies across industries and nations, it’s clear from the current negative sentiment toward established systems that people are searching for more equitable solutions.\n\nBlockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees—what we often call cryptographic truth—in restoring users’ trust in everyday interactions.\n\nNote: We use the word “app” in a broad sense to refer to any interface for interacting with a company, government, or other users on the same platform, whether it be an application you download on your phone or a website. Additionally, when explaining blockchains, we focus on permissionless blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin) given their widespread adoption as opposed to permissioned blockchains.\n\nThe breakdown of trust in traditional institutions and processes is apparent in many aspects of modern societies. Listed below are four problems causing distrust, which directly impact quality of life and economic prosperity.\n\nOne outcome of the way the Internet was originally architected is that applications (apps) are mostly centralized. A centralized entity typically owns an app’s intellectual property (IP), controls its backend computing, makes key decisions on its future development, and profits from any data and revenue generated. This centralization creates an unequal relationship between users and apps that can easily be abused and fuel distrust.\n\nFor example, apps can often unilaterally censor the actions of users. Though such actions may be justified as clear violations of terms of service agreements such as the removal of illicit activities, there are many instances where censorship is based on subjective interpretations of vague policies. This puts into question the platform’s credible neutrality—no discrimination for or against any specific people—particularly in situations when the platform’s own financial interests are at stake, external political or social pressure is applied, or users’ personal opinions don’t directly align with the platform’s own. Such forces have resulted in polarizing debates as to whether social media, financial services, content streaming, and various other platforms are justified in censoring or not censoring certain content.\n\nCentralization also leads to power structures where small groups of people largely control how platform revenue is distributed and the direction of development while users are left without much say. Though it’s true that owners generally start and manage apps and are to an extent responsible for their success, it’s also true that users often provide immense value to apps as content creators. For instance, users give social media platforms value through the material they generate, which is monetized directly by app developers via advertising. This undoubtedly makes users question whether or not they are getting fair compensation and representation.\n\nUsers are also becoming more concerned about having to trust apps with their sensitive data. Since users often have to create accounts to interact with apps, the apps are responsible for storing users’ personal information. This centralized storage model opens up a single point of attack for hackers that has resulted in numerous data breaches, as was the case with Equifax, for example. It’s also why apps are able to monetize users’ data without sharing revenue with users. As many have suggested, “if it’s free, then you’re the product” is the basis for most Web2 economic models.\n\nA further reason for distrust is the fact that participants in a social or economic relationship don’t always operate with reference to the same source of truth. For instance, there are many business relationships where all participants maintain their own set of records. Not only can an honest mistake from a single participant lead to a lengthy reconciliation process, but it’s possible for parties to intentionally falsify their records in an attempt to delay the agreement, escape their obligations, or present a false sense of success to their counterparties.\n\nLook no further than the Wirecard scandal, which saw many financial services companies take losses when the German company Wirecard was found to be engaging in fraudulent accounting practices to cover up €1.9 billion in missing funds from its balance sheet. Similarly, the 2007-2008 financial crisis severely impacted the global financial industry, largely because of a poor shared understanding regarding its systemic overexposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and MBS-linked derivatives.\n\nUnderpinning this dynamic is the fact that users don’t always understand the legal relationship they have with an institution. Though the misunderstanding could be interpreted as the fault of users for not reading terms of service agreements, it’s fair to ask whether users should be expected to take time to read and understand long contracts with dense legal jargon that’s purposely vague in order to enable a range of interpretations. When things are going well, misunderstandings may never manifest. However, when unexpected events occur, users often learn that their relationship with an institution is not quite what they thought. Unclear legal relationships are why many traders were blindsided when they learned Robinhood could halt purchases of the GME stock during a period of high trade volume, or why Greek citizens were shocked in 2015 when their banks informed them that they were only allowed to withdraw €60 a day from ATMs.\n\nThe same misunderstanding is often true regarding the relationship users think they have with social media apps, particularly with regard to how their data is collected and shared and how the app’s algorithm determines what they see in their news feeds. Algorithms in particular have fueled distrust because of their opaque nature, with users unable to understand why some material takes preference while other material is not shown at all. This lack of clarity naturally leads to users suggesting political bias or undisclosed influences around the news that’s deemed real and credible and the news that isn’t, further causing a breakdown of trust.\n\nDisputes are inevitable in certain circumstances, so when they arise it’s critical to resolve them in a manner that’s generally seen as fair. The challenge, however, is that larger institutions often have asymmetrical advantages in dispute resolution processes. This is particularly worrisome in contracts between established institutions and retail users, where the institution knows they have more leeway to renege on their stated commitments given that the user doesn’t have the time, capital, or influence to mount a successful lawsuit. In fact, in some developing countries, the legal system is so unreliable in the face of powerful influences and bribery that certain economic relationships are simply not practical.\n\nMistrust in dispute resolution processes is also subject to a dynamic where an institution becomes so powerful and integrated within a society that it becomes “too big to fail”—a phrase used to describe institutions that governments will bail out after they make poor decisions because their failure presents too much systemic risk. The term was originally derived from the public bailout of large banking and financial services companies that went bankrupt due to overexposure to toxic MBS assets during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It could be argued that a similar dynamic can be seen today in a seeming lack of accountability from governments and central banks, as high inflation and increasing economic inequality takes hold despite their stated goals of controlling inflation and promoting economic stability.\n\nThrough the addition of trusted third parties and manual verification techniques, the risks of low-trust social and economic relationships can be somewhat offset. However, these processes involve increased costs, longer wait times, and additional trust assumptions. One industry subject to such inefficiencies is international remittances, where a $200 dollar transaction in 2020 incurred on average a 6.5% fee and sometimes took more than 24 hours to settle. Technically, remittances could be near-instant given advancements in digital technology, but not all banks trust each other. Thus, payments have to be routed through several correspondent banks to get to their final destination, incurring fees and extending the settlement time along the way.\n\nInstead of counterparties having to trust each other or a third party to follow through on their stated commitments, what if the infrastructure facilitating their interaction could guarantee fair outcomes? And what if that infrastructure had no central administrator or owner?In order to meet these goals, this infrastructure would have to embody two key design principles: minimally extractive coordination and trust-minimized execution.\n\nBlockchains combine these two properties, serving as minimally extractive coordinators that execute code in a trust-minimized manner. Blockchains provide such properties because they do not have central administrators, but are decentralized computer networks that are financially incentivized to maintain an accurate ledger of who owns specific data and assets on the network. Every time someone creates a new asset, transfers an existing asset to another user, or stores data on the blockchain, a decentralized network of nodes must form a consensus around the validity of each interaction before it’s approved. For instance, if a user wants to send money from one account to another, the blockchain will verify that the user has enough money to fund the transaction before executing it.\n\nDecentralized consensus and cryptography are combined in blockchains to form the basis for cryptographic truth—validation of new transactions based on the verification of historical information already stored in the blockchain ledger and deemed true. In this sense, blockchains are deterministic, since approving new transactions doesn’t require new or external information.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of blockchains, refer to these articles: What is Blockchain Technology? and Blockchains and Oracles: Similarities, Differences, and Synergies.\n\nWhile many recognize blockchains for supporting cryptocurrency-based payment systems, blockchains enable much greater utility through their support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are “if x, then y” programs that run on blockchains in a tamper-proof manner. Developers use one or more smart contracts to create decentralized applications (dApps), with the smart contracts essentially representing the terms and conditions that users must abide by when interacting with the dApp. For a deep dive on smart contracts, check out this article: What Is a Smart Contract?Oracles are critical to creating advanced dApps. Because of the way blockchains are secured, they are inherently disconnected from the outside world—akin to a computer without the Internet. Oracles are supporting infrastructure for blockchains that allow them to interact with external data and systems. In doing so, oracles enable smart contracts to use external data to trigger their execution (e.g. sports match results to settle a wager), send data to external systems for settlement (e.g. payment messages to execute a bank payment), interoperate with smart contracts on other blockchains, and perform computations not possible or practical to do on a blockchain. In this regard, oracles enable hybrid smart contracts—combining on-chain code with off-chain code to form a single application.\n\nChainlink pioneered decentralized oracle networks (DONs) in order to bring trust-minimized properties to oracle services and enable competitive marketplaces that mitigate rent-seeking extraction from oracle providers. The result has been an explosion in new smart contract use cases enabled by Chainlink DONs, such as in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Play-to-Earn gaming (P2E), decentralized insurance, and more.\n\nTo learn more about oracles and Chainlink, refer to these articles: What is a Blockchain Oracle? and What is Chainlink? A Beginners Guide.\n\nThe combination of blockchains and oracles provides an end-to-end trust network for coordinating economic and social activities. Blockchains act as tamper-proof backends for codifying, tracking, and enforcing digital contracts while oracles enable smart contracts to accurately verify real-world events, seamlessly interact with legacy systems, and securely interoperate across blockchains. This model shifts applications and digital contracts from probabilistic and human-mediated to deterministic and verified through decentralized consensus.\n\nBy applying blockchain and oracle-powered trust networks to the original problems outlined above, it becomes possible to build a world based on truth, where processes and people stick to their agreements and records are highly reliable.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of blockchain technology is the decentralization of the apps/institutions responsible for facilitating social or economic activity. Blockchain technology can create credibly neutral platforms where the ability for platforms to arbitrarily censor users because of financial, political, or social pressures is largely removed. Once the terms and conditions are coded into smart contracts and stored on the blockchain, the relationship between the users and dApps is transparent to all and cannot be overridden by either party or a central administrator.\n\nDecentralized system design also removes intermediaries as custodians. Instead, the blockchain is akin to a non-custodial facilitator, where all the data produced by dApps is publicly viewable and immutable, and the users have direct control of their data/assets via private keys that only they possess. For instance, anyone can view the entire transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger and anyone can custody and send their Bitcoin to other users on the network without a bank.\n\nAdditionally, privacy-preserving oracle solutions are emerging, such as Chainlink’s DECO, which is being built to allow users to prove sensitive information to dApps without revealing it publicly. For example, a user could prove they live in a certain jurisdiction or that their bank balance is above a certain amount without revealing their address or exact balance to the dApp—ultimately removing the responsibility from dApps to store credentials while still making use of them.\n\nBlockchains and the dApps they support are also democratizing access to their cash flows. The Ethereum blockchain, for example, is moving to a proof-of-stake consensus model where anyone in the world can stake (i.e. lock up in a non-custodial manner) its native ETH cryptocurrency in a specific smart contract in order to become a validator on the network. In becoming a validator, the user can earn a portion of the value generated by the Ethereum blockchain as a reward for validating user transactions.\n\nSimilar dynamics exist in DeFi applications like Curve, a decentralized exchange designed for low-slippage trades. Within Curve, users can choose to lock the native CRV token in a staking smart contract for up to four years, which provides them with governance rights over the dApp and a proportional percentage of 50% of all trading fee revenue generated by the dApp.\n\nBlockchains and dApps are generally open-source technologies where all users have a shared understanding of the code powering the dApp and the data generated from its operations. Essentially, the blockchain is a single, public repository of records that are made equally available to all participants, removing reconciliation disputes and making transparent any systemic risk. Transactions are also verified through a decentralized consensus mechanism as opposed to the opinion of a single user or administrator, meaning the relationship between users and dApps will follow the codified terms.\n\nWhen extended to verifying external connections, oracles often use a decentralized network of nodes and numerous data sources to prevent any single point of failure in verification and execution. For example, Chainlink Price Feeds are DONs that supply real-time asset prices on blockchains to support Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a collection of dApps that provide financial services to users such as lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and more.\n\nOther oracle solutions for generating shared truth include the Ledger of Record proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, former Coinbase CTO and A16Z General Partner. The Ledger of Record is a concept that uses oracles to cryptographically sign data on blockchains to prove its origin, helping establish a verifiable provenance of information. Not only would it help prevent fake news, deep fakes, and hidden news retractions, but it can be the basis for reputation systems that track the historical credibility of data sources and analysts.\n\nBecause blockchains validate transactions on their networks through decentralized consensus, the asymmetrical advantages held by larger counterparties during disputes are generally removed. There is no blockchain administrator to bail dApps out or hit redo after a mistake is made. Instead, blockchains replace human administrators with decentralized networks secured by cryptography and financial incentives to make it extremely difficult to tamper with the consensus mechanism or alter previously stored data.\n\nWhile blockchains and dApps can be built in a manner that enables changes, they generally require social consensus amongst many independent users as opposed to the unilateral decision-making seen in centralized Apps. This is why many dApps are governed through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where users vote on changes. In fact, many dApps have their own native token, which is used by their DAOs to decide on proposals via token-weighted votes.\n\nA highly tamper-proof and globally accessible blockchain platform for enforcing digital contracts vastly reduces counterparty risk. Many blockchains and dApps even take it a step further by introducing automatically enforced punishments for bad behavior from participants. For instance, proof-of-stake blockchains can punish validators that act maliciously by confiscating some of their staked tokens as a form of punishment. dApps can also hold users’ capital in escrow and distribute it only after verifying certain events, making it near impossible for the losing side to forgo payment.\n\nDecentralized oracle networks offer similar assurances by generating definitive truth—where each dApp defines exactly how they want to derive truth from the external world and what falls outside of those bounds. In this sense, oracles are more flexible in verifying external events for smart contracts, as some users may trust different data sources while others may want to pay for more decentralization of the oracle network. No matter how the users design the oracle mechanism, they must all agree that it’s sufficient to service their needs. The agreement between the users and oracles can then be made into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) smart contract to avoid tampering and automatically enforce rewards/penalties upon completion.\n\nOne example of an oracle service that provides definitive truth is Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF uses oracle technology to generate random numbers and cryptographic proofs off-chain. It then publishes them on-chain, where the blockchain uses the cryptographic proof to verify that the random number was not tampered with by the oracles. NFT and gaming applications use the randomness provided by Chainlink VRF to perform various on-chain functions, such as picking winners of special NFT drops and determining the content of loot boxes. Importantly, users are able to independently verify that the process is fair and unbiased, with even the game developers/NFT creators not able to influence the randomized outcome.\n\nNot only do blockchains provide higher security, reliability, and accuracy guarantees for their computations, but they operate in a peer-to-peer manner. By removing intermediaries, rent-seeking and settlement times can be reduced. This is most evident in Ethereum layer-2 scalability solutions—networks built on top of Ethereum that are optimized for lower costs and higher throughput while still deriving their security from the baselayer Ethereum blockchain. With layer-2 solutions, users can make peer-to-peer payments of any amount to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes and for less than a standard international wire fee.\n\nThis peer-to-peer quality is also evident in new parametric insurance dApps such as those created by Arbol and Etherisc, which enable anyone to purchase weather and flight insurance, with the only requirement being an Internet connection. The smart contract settles the policy once an oracle network confirms the outcome of the specific insurable event, e.g. crop insurance settled by the amount of seasonal rainfall in a particular region or flight insurance determined by whether or not flights are canceled. Once the oracle report is delivered, the smart contract can instantly release compensation from escrow without needing any human approvals.\n\nIf the innovation timeline of the Internet is any indicator, society has only just scratched the surface of what’s possible using blockchain and oracle technology. The possibilities are truly endless, and have the potential to re-establish trust in society’s most foundational social and economic processes.\n\nIf blockchain technology interests you and you want to begin working in the industry, check out our walkthrough How to Become a Smart Contract Developer to learn how to start building and explore careers at industry-leading organizations like Chainlink Labs, where there are a wide range of open technical and non-technical roles.\n\nIf you want to familiarize yourself more with blockchain and oracle technologies, we encourage you to read through the growing list of educational materials on our blog.

    "content": "Smart contracts are computer programs published and executed in a blockchain environment. As they run on blockchains, they can be run without a central party or server. They are commonly written in the Solidity language.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts can interact with existing deployed contracts. This also applies to any other EVM-compatible blockchain (any blockchain that was created using the Ethereum virtual machine).\n\nHere are some example of smart contracts that interact with other smart contracts:Sometimes an application needs to be split into several smart contracts. For example, I once created an application that was already separated into three smart contracts that interacted with each other, but I couldn’t publish it on Ethereum mainnet because the size in bytes exceeded the allowed limit. I had to refactor the application to split it into five smart contracts in order for the app to be published.\n\nAnother interesting use case is upgradeable contracts. Blockchains are immutable, which means it’s not possible to change the code of a smart contract once it has been deployed. But it is possible to create a proxy delegating function calls to another contract that contains the actual business logic.\n\nIf you would like to change the logic, you can provide a different target address to the proxy contract, for example a new deployed version with some improvements. It is possible to separate logic and data into different smart contracts. The logic contract could be updated or swapped out via proxy while retaining all information in the data contract.\n\nThis feature is very powerful as it allows code to be reused and some deployed contracts to be used like libraries. It can also reduce deployment costs because the contract which uses the library doesn’t need to include all the code itself.\n\nLet’s use Remix, an online web tool. Go to remix.ethereum.org to get started.\n\nCreate a file to add smart contracts to. Yes, it is possible to have more than one smart contract in the same file!You’ll write and deploy two smart contracts in Solidity inside this file.\n\nFirst of all, define the SPDX license type and compiler version. Copy and paste this part:The first contract is the “Counter,” a script to increment a number.\n\nCopy and paste this example:This Counter contract has:Compile the Counter contractDeploy the Counter contractLocate the contract at the bottom of the left panel and copy its address. For example, mine is:0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138You should see something like the image below:Expand the Counter contract and:This is the final result:Now that we have our first contract deployed, let’s create another contract which will use the Counter increment function. This is a mechanism like dependency injection. The caller can instantiate the contract it wants to call and knows the type signature of the functions and public variables.\n\nCopy and paste this code at the end of the Contracts.sol file:The CounterCaller contract has:Check it out the whole file Contracts.sol:Compile the CounterCaller contractNow, let’s deploy the CounterCaller contract. In the left side panel, go to the button “Deploy and run transactions”.\n\nLocate the CounterCaller contract at the bottom of the left panel and expand it.\n\nThis is the final result:This is a basic example to help you learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract using Solidity.\n\nThere are other ways to delegate calls between contracts in Solidity. It is important to notice that a deployed contract always has an address and if you know the functions and public variables, another smart contract can call it.\n\nNow that you know how to call a smart contract from another smart contract, a whole host of use cases and abilities are open to you. You can:If you’re a developer and want to secure your smart contracts, dApp, or protocol, consider using Chainlink in your smart contract applications.

    "summary": "Learn about Chainlink in 5 minutes with our beginner’s guide, which covers blockchain oracles, the oracle problem, and universally connected smart contracts.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.\n\nWith cryptocurrency and blockchain technology gaining mainstream attention and Chainlink establishing itself as a key component of many blockchain applications, more people are entering the industry and asking the fundamental question: what is Chainlink?In order to help those new to blockchains, smart contracts, and oracles, we’ve created a simple overview to showcase the value of the Chainlink oracle network and how it enables blockchain technology to reach its full potential. This guide provides context on Chainlink by answering three key questions:To fully comprehend the importance of Chainlink, it’s critical to first understand the underlying value of blockchains and smart contracts. Generally, a blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that performs computation and stores data in a shared ledger. A blockchain differs from traditional, centralized computer systems in that:Blockchains achieve these properties by having thousands of computers run the same software, process the same transactions, store the same data, and consistently cross-check one another to reach consensus as a network about what is valid. All these network operations are backed by monetary incentives that reinforce honest behavior and consensus. By redundantly validating and storing transactions across a large decentralized network of financially incentivized participants, blockchains make it extremely expensive and impractical to manipulate the shared ledger.\n\nThus, blockchains are extremely secure and reliable systems for performing computation and storing data for processes involving two or more independent parties. The fundamental benefit of blockchains is that they mitigate counterparty risk—the risk that the other party in a contract won’t uphold their end of the agreement. For example, if someone wants to make a digital trade with a stranger, how do they decide who sends money first, whether they have enough funds, and that the funds can’t be spent twice (commonly known as the double spending problem)? Traditionally, users would employ a third party such as a payment processor or clearinghouse to facilitate the trade or arbitrate a dispute. However, a blockchain serves as a more reliable, tamperproof, and unbiased system for settling transactions. Users know that when they send a transaction to the blockchain, it will execute exactly as instructed.\n\nA blockchain’s decentralized architecture is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged as such strong forms of money: users can trust that no central administrator will inflate the supply (capped at 21M BTC) and that the underlying Bitcoin blockchain showing who owns Bitcoin has been validated by thousands of computers across the world. Also, the decentralized design of the blockchain allows users to exchange value directly, “peer-to-peer”, removing custodial middlemen who can siphon off fees and censor transactions, ultimately allowing users to retain ownership over their assets and data.\n\nHowever, blockchains can support many use cases beyond simply moving and recording money on a ledger. Some highly programmable blockchains allow a more expressive set of commands, specifically through running applications on the network that trigger actions based on specific, predefined events (if x event happens, then execute y action). For example, if Flight 777 is canceled tomorrow, issue an insurance payout of $77; if not, then don’t make the payment. These blockchain applications, which can process a wider range of logic, are referred to as “smart contracts,” and have been the subject of much of the development around blockchains since Ethereum first introduced them at scale in 2015.\n\nThe problem is that a smart contract requires data (e.g. flight departure information) to execute commands, but most of the data it needs to digitize and automate real-world agreements is not stored on blockchains. The smart contract cannot fetch external data either, because blockchains are like black boxes with no built-in ability to connect with the outside world. This means that asset prices, sports scores, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, web data, enterprise systems, and the multitude of other real-world datasets are simply not available on the blockchain, severely limiting the types of smart contracts developers can create. How does one develop a flight insurance agreement without flight data?The only way to efficiently get data into the blockchain is for a software component called an “oracle” to input it into the blockchain. The challenge then becomes, how to design an oracle mechanism with the same security and reliability properties of the underlying blockchain so as to retain the underlying value proposition of the smart contract, e.g. extreme reliability without counterparty risk. If a single, centralized oracle is responsible for inputting the data used to trigger the smart contract, then that oracle has complete control over the smart contract’s outcome. This introduces a serious point of failure known as the oracle problem, which puts the entire smart contract at risk.\n\nChainlink, a decentralized oracle network, was developed to allow smart contracts to automate the transfer of data between blockchains and outside systems in a highly secure and reliable manner. It uses a similar model to a blockchain in that there is a decentralized network of independent entities (oracles) that collectively retrieve data from multiple sources, aggregate it, and deliver a validated, single data point to the smart contract to trigger its execution, removing any centralized point of failure.\n\nFor example, Chainlink provides the USD price of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ETH to blockchains via the ETH/USD Price Feed, which uses numerous independent oracle nodes and data sources to source and deliver the price data (pictured below). The ETH/USD price oracle can then be used by a blockchain application to get the current price of ETH when being used as collateral to obtain a loan or to settle a prediction made about the future ETH price.\n\nChainlink also provides multiple layers of security that go beyond decentralization to ensure users can trust the oracle network:By providing strong security and reliability guarantees on par with the blockchain, more advanced smart contracts are being created using Chainlink oracles. While we have already outlined 77 Smart Contract Use Cases Enabled By Chainlink, some of the main ones include:Many traditional financial products like loans, payments, derivatives, asset equity, and more are being built on the blockchain using smart contracts to increase their security and transparency and reduce barriers to entry. These DeFi applications use Chainlink to price assets, access interest rates, verify collateralization, and more, which enable these products to perform functions like issue a loan at fair market value, automate the issuance of dividends, and settle an options contract.\n\nSmart contracts are also being leveraged to create parametric insurance contracts on the blockchain. Chainlink is currently being used in production to provide weather data to the Arbol crop insurance market, enabling farmers all over the world to obtain parametric crop insurance simply with an Internet connection, which is settled in a fair and timely manner according to the amount of rainfall, temperature, or other evaluators the policy is set to (e.g. if it rains more than x amount this year, pay out y settlement).\n\nDevelopers are also beginning to launch smart contract-based gaming applications on the blockchain that often incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) as scarce digital collectibles. One of the key building blocks of many blockchain games is a source of randomness to generate random in-game scenarios or determine the lucky winner of prizes. Chainlink provides a randomness solution called VRF, which generates randomness and delivers it to the smart contract in a manner where users can prove it is fair and unbiased, as neither the players, game creators, or external entities can tamper with or manipulate the randomness to their advantage.\n\nAnother key use case of Chainlink is providing traditional systems like data providers, IoT networks, websites, and enterprises a way to make their data and services available to any blockchain network. Since the Chainlink Network is blockchain-agnostic, Chainlink oracles serve as an integration gateway for connecting current digital and data infrastructure to any/all blockchain networks. An industry-standard interoperability framework using oracle networks like Chainlink to connect traditional systems with blockchains was outlined in the recent World Economic Forum report co-authored by Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov titled Bridging the Governance Gap: Interoperability for Blockchain and Legacy Systems.\n\nThese are just some of the many capabilities Chainlink provides to allow smart contracts to interact with external data and systems with a high degree of security and reliability. The end result is the ability for blockchain-based smart contract applications to enable extensively more use cases across a more diverse set of markets.\n\nIf blockchains are decentralized computers and smart contracts are decentralized applications, then Chainlink can be thought of like a decentralized Internet that finally allows smart contracts to interact with the outside world while maintaining blockchain technology’s fundamental guarantees around security, transparency, and trust.\n\nIf you are new to blockchain technology and want to dive deeper, we recommend reading the following educational series in order:If you want something more technical, we encourage you to read the original Chainlink whitepaper, Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper, developer documentation, and browse through the Chainlink blog for a wide variety of resources.\n\nTo stay up-to-date with the latest news, follow the official Chainlink Twitter, and subscribe to the Chainlink newsletter.\n\n",

Over a dozen major global financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers are participating in the collaboration, including DTCC, BNY Mellon, Citi, and Euroclear.\n\n“[This collaboration] will also highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.”—Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Securities Strategy at SwiftToday, the world’s contractual value is fragmented across both the existing financial system and the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem. The fragmentation of blockchain networks is similar to the early days of the Internet, where there were separate intranets, LANs, and consortiums of terminals that couldn’t interact with one another.\n\nThe early interoperability standards completely transformed the Internet. TCP/IP, HTTP, and email protocols enabled seamless connectivity between users, who then saw their web applications increase in value exponentially as more people joined the network.\n\nIt shouldn’t matter what blockchain you launch a dApp or token on or what type of backend system you want to interact from—as long as that environment is connected to an interoperability standard, it can access any chain and its supported dApps.\n\nNow, CCIP provides a connectivity standard that enables traditional finance to easily interact with smart contracts, as well as securely transact across different public and private blockchains. Connectivity both to and across multiple blockchains is critical for creating a unified financial system where tokens and messages can seamlessly flow across different environments.\n\nSimilar to TCP/IP’s foundational role in Internet communication, Chainlink CCIP is the foundation for an interoperable blockchain ecosystem. The key difference between TCP/IP and CCIP is that while TCP/IP enables information to flow freely across the Internet, CCIP enables value to be transferred across networks securely. The launch of CCIP marks a key moment in the evolution of the Internet and moves society one step closer to a world underpinned by interoperable smart contracts: The Internet of Contracts.\n\n“Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.”—Chainlink Co-Founder, Sergey NazarovBecoming the industry standard across both bank chains and public blockchains positions CCIP to become the universal connectivity layer bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. We envision a future where Web3 and the global financial system are largely one and the same, with vast amounts of value flowing across these systems and chains via CCIP.\n\nBy connecting these two worlds, the extensive liquidity and technological infrastructure already present in the global financial system can take advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and connectivity advantages now available through blockchains. Given the massive size of the global banking system, if even a small fraction of assets move on-chain and connect to the Internet of Contracts, the Web3 ecosystem could grow exponentially.\n\nIf you are interested in using Chainlink as a gateway to on-chain finance, reach out to our experts.\n\n",

    "title": "5 Ways To Use CCIP in Your Cross-Chain Applications\n\n",
    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "Discover how to use Chainlink CCIP to create cross-chain applications, enabling a less fragmented Web3.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a new generalized cross-chain communication protocol that provides smart contract developers with the ability to transfer data and tokens across blockchain networks in a trust-minimized manner.\n\nCurrently, applications deployed across multiple blockchains suffer from the fragmentation of assets, liquidity, and users. With CCIP, developers can utilize token transfers and arbitrary messaging to enable the creation of decentralized applications that are composed of multiple different smart contracts deployed across multiple different blockchain networks that interoperate to create a single unified application. This Web3 design pattern is known as the cross-chain smart contract.\n\nBelow are a few examples of CCIP use cases for cross-chain applications, ranging from DeFi and cross-chain ENS to minting NFTs on multiple chains to cross-chain gaming. These use case examples demonstrate the potential for CCIP to transform traditional single-chain or multi-chain applications into powerful new cross-chain dApps.\n\nAll examples can be found on the Chainlink Labs GitHub and can be deployed and interacted with now.\n\nDeFi is a category of Web3 applications that is ripe for transformation by cross-chain smart contracts. In the world of DeFi today, many applications are either deployed on a single chain or on multiple chains, with each instance requiring its own set of users and liquidity. Within each chain, there is a concept of DeFi composability and “money Legos,” with developers able to permissionless-ly connect and integrate with various protocols deployed on a particular network to create new use cases and financial products.\n\nBy enabling cross-chain smart contracts and cross-chain token transfers, CCIP takes the concept of DeFi composability and exponentially multiplies it. Because now, instead of composability being restricted to each chain and limited to the DeFi protocols on that chain, all DeFi applications on all blockchains can now be composed together in various ways to create new financial products. Applications and protocols are no longer confined to the chain they’re on.\n\nThis cross-chain composability of DeFi applications enables a less fragmented and more connected DeFi ecosystem, with liquidity, users, and financial products on all chains being available to all protocols. Using the money Legos analogy, CCIP enables you to bring all of your different Lego sets together and build financial protocols with them as if they were a single, unified set.\n\nOne particular DeFi financial service that would greatly benefit from CCIP is lending and borrowing. In today’s world, most DeFi lending and borrowing protocols require you to deposit collateral on the chain the protocol you want to use is deployed on. But many DeFi users use multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains and have assets scattered across all these chains. These users often chase the best returns, adjusting their positions to maximize yield, but in many cases they have assets locked up in protocols on one chain when there are better yield-earning opportunities to use those assets on another chain. If they wanted to participate in those superior yield opportunities, they’d need to liquidate their position on one chain, manually bridge the asset to the new chain, deposit that asset on to the protocol on the new chain, and then perform the same process in reverse when they want to return their asset to the originating chain—a lot of steps just to move assets into a new protocol to chase yield opportunities.\n\nScenarios like this are where CCIP can help enable DeFi protocols to truly go cross-chain, and allow users to seamlessly utilize digital assets on one chain as collateral for a DeFi protocol on another chain, all handled by CCIP at the protocol level, without the user having to perform manual steps, or adding trust assumptions due to using a third party bridge. Using CCIP, a DeFi protocol can enable a borrower to deposit assets on one (source) chain, or transfer them directly to a destination chain, and then have those assets made available on the destination chain to borrow against. Then when they wish to stop using their assets on the destination chain, the DeFi protocol can use CCIP to withdraw their position and move their assets back to the originating chain. This is the power of CCIP-enabled DeFi.\n\nIn this example, we have a DeFi smart contract Sender.sol on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. This contract accepts user deposits in the form of a token; it could be wrapped ETH, a stablecoin, or any token that has a real value. Sender.sol has a sendMessage function, which uses CCIP to execute a programmable token transfer of the specified tokens as well as a message to a destination chain. In this case, we are sending the specified tokens to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, with the message containing the end-user’s EOA (externally owned account):Note: All code examples in this post are illustrative and are provided on an “as-is” basis without any representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions of any kind. Use of these code snippets is governed by our Terms of Service found at chain.link/terms.\n\nOn the Ethereum Sepolia network, we have deployed a Protocol.sol smart contract. This contract receives the CCIP programmable token transfer message and does the following:Once this CCIP programmable token transfer message has been received and successfully processed by Protocol.sol, the user can then manually initiate an action to borrow funds by executing the borrowUSDC function. This function allows the user to use the transferred tokens as collateral to mint and borrow an equivalent amount of a stablecoin, such as USDC, to the borrower’s EOA. In this example, we assume a 70% collateralization ratio, meaning that the protocol will lend no more than 70% of the value of the deposited token:Once the user has successfully borrowed UDSC on Sepolia against their deposited collateral, they can then use the funds as they wish on any DeFi protocol on the Sepolia network. Then, when they are done, they can repay the funds to Protocol.sol, which will cause the stablecoin tokens to be burnt, and a CCIP programmable token transfer message is then sent back to the Sender.sol contract on the Fuji network, which will return the locked up tokens to the specified address on the Fuji network. Note that the user must first approve Protocol.sol as a “spender” of the user’s borrowed stablecoin for the protocol to be able to burn the borrowed amount, which is how repayment is implemented:The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP-DeFi Lending GitHub repository.\n\nContinuing with the theme of DeFi and lending and borrowing protocols, many DeFi users have multiple positions held across multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains. This makes keeping track of portfolios and DeFi positions difficult. There are multiple third-party platforms, trackers, and even yield aggregators available, with DeFi users able to simply deploy collateral and let these third-party platforms handle the deploying and moving around of assets to optimize yield for the end-user. While these tools are a great way to abstract away some of the complexities of DeFi so users can simply earn yield, they are not trust-minimized. The user is entrusting the protocol to earn yield and to ensure positions are kept collateralized to avoid liquidation. In addition to this, if the end-user wants to have some sort of liquidation protection, they are required to have native assets deployed across all blockchains they have DeFi positions in, ready to be deployed to ensure collateralization of loans on the positions they have on each respective chain.\n\nWith CCIP and cross-chain token transfers and messaging, DeFi protocols, position monitoring apps, and yield aggregators can be enhanced to have cross-chain liquidation protection. This means that a user can have open positions on multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains, and they can then allocate assets on a single chain to be used as extra collateral in the event that one or more of the loans requires extra funds to ensure collateralization. Here’s how that works at a high level:The result of this is the user can have debt positions on multiple chains while still keeping liquidity on a single chain. The entire process is trust-minimized, with the user still 100% in control of their debt positions, and they do not have to manually withdraw and move funds across chains. Here’s how it works:Chainlink Automation monitors all chains where a user has a debit position and determines if a message for funding needs to be sent. If required, the performUpkeep function will then send a CCIP message to the vault on the chain that has liquidity, requesting funds to be sent.\n\nThe vault on the chain that has the liquidity then receives the request for funds and checks if it has enough funds to send back to the requesting chain or if it should withdraw some liquidity from a DeFi protocol (such as Aave) to ensure it has enough funds to send. Following this, it then initiates a CCIP programmable token transfer containing the funds requested as well as the message ID of the initially received message (so the destination contract on the blockchain that requested funds knows which request the funds are for):Finally, the smart contract on the chain that requested funds to top up a debt position receives the CCIP programmable token transfer, matches up the request ID with it’s original request, and then takes the funds and deposits the transferred funds into the debt position in order to increase the collateralization of the loan and avoid a liquidation:This example demonstrates how CCIP can be utilized in DeFi protocols and DeFi position monitoring applications to provide users with trust-minimized liquidation protection of their debt positions across multiple blockchains while allowing them to keep their funds and liquidity on a single blockchain.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Liquidation Protector GitHub repository.\n\nDecentralized domain name services like ENS are extremely popular in Web3, as they facilitate the translation of human readable names to wallet addresses. In an ideal world, domain name services should not be specific to one chain, but each registered domain should propagate and live across all Ethereum chains, side chains, layer 2s, and app chains. This would allow users to have a single, unified identity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, as opposed to having to register domains across multiple naming services or using interoperability solutions that aren’t trust-minimized.\n\nHowever, to achieve this, domain name services would be required to communicate with other blockchains. Each instance of the naming service on a blockchain would need to be notified when new domains are registered, and there would need to be a way to perform “lookups” against a global name registry across all blockchains.\n\nThis example showcases how you could build a simplified cross-chain naming service application, where users could register domains on one chain and have that registration propagate across multiple other blockchains as well as resolve names to addresses across any blockchain.\n\nThe first step is to deploy the CrossChainNameServiceRegister and CrossChainNameServiceLookup contracts to the Ethereum Sepolia network. This network will act as the “home” network where all registrations will occur, and then propagate to other chains.\n\nWhen you register a new .ccns handle, the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract will use CCIP to send a message to other supported blockchains containing information about the registered .ccns handle:On all the supported receiving blockchains, the CrossChainNameServiceReceiver contract would be deployed. This contract would receive registered .ccns domains from the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract, and would store them in the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract deployed on that blockchain:Finally, the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract would be deployed on all blockchains, including the registering blockchain (in this case, Sepolia), as well as all destination blockchains. This contract would be used to store all registered .ccns handles and act as an interface to perform lookups to translate names to addresses:Using this simple design pattern, it becomes possible to create a simple cross-chain domain name service where users can register a domain once, then own and use it across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain Name Service GitHub repository.\n\nNFTs are one of the most popular use cases in Web3. Each NFT project is usually on a single blockchain, or the project itself has multiple deployments across multiple chains, with end-users having to mint the NFT more than once if they want to own it on multiple blockchains.\n\nWith CCIP Arbitrary Messaging, NFT projects can allow for their assets to be minted once on a single chain, paid for once by the minter, and then have them propagated to the user on other blockchains. This means users can own and share their NFT, irrespective of which network they are using. CCIP can also be used to “burn and mint” NFTs across chains, allowing users to move their NFTs from one chain to another. Here is an example of how the first scenario works:The MyNFT contract contains a simple NFT smart contract with a mint function:The sourceMinter contract is deployed on the source chain, and contains logic in its mint function to send a CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature from the MyNFT.sol smart contract to the destination blockchain:The DestinationMinter smart contract will receive the CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature as a payload, and call the mint function in the MyNFT smart contract function using it. The MyNFT smart contract will then mint the new NFT to the msg.sender account from the mint() function of the SourceMinter smart contract, i.e. to the same account address for which the NFT was minted on the source chain:The end result is that the user that minted the NFT now owns the NFT on multiple chains, and they only had to mint and pay for it once. If the NFT project wants to remain strictly non-fungible even across blockchains, this solution can also be easily modified to mint the NFT on a destination blockchain and burn it on the source chain afterwards, ensuring there is only ever one version of it across all blockchains.\n\nThe complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain NFT GitHub repository.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Web3 gaming has become massively popular. However, like DeFi, gaming is very fragmented, with games and their assets usually being specific to a certain chain. But like traditional gaming, the ultimate goal or best experience is when you have gamers that can play a game together, irrespective of the hardware or software they’re playing on. Just like how a PC gamer can play games with Xbox console owners, there should be no reason why someone can’t play a game on Polygon with someone playing on Avalanche. This is known as cross-platform gaming.\n\nThis translates perfectly to turn-based Web3 games and other games that do not require fast real-time interaction. Web3 gaming suffers from user fragmentation, with gamers preferring to play on their chain of choice and use their preferred digital assets. CCIP enables Web3 games to be truly cross-chain, facilitating the transferring of assets across chains and enabling a shared game state across multiple blockchains, allowing gamers to play each other regardless of the chain they want to use. If you want to reach as many gamers as possible, then it makes sense to have your game deployed across multiple chains and design it in a way where all players can play against or with each other.\n\nA simple demonstration of this cross-chain gaming design pattern can be shown with a turn-based strategy game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. In this example, we have a game smart contract that is deployed on multiple blockchains. Users can then start a game on their chain of choice and then share the game session ID with their friends. Their friends can then join the game from another chain if they wish. On game creation, CCIP will have shared the game details and initial state with all the other chains:Once the first player has taken a turn after initiating the game, the second player on another blockchain will see the updated game state on their game smart contract once the CCIP message is successfully processed. Player 2 will then take their turn, which will generate a CCIP message to get sent back to player 1 and update the state of the game on their chain:Player 1 will then see the updated game state and make their move once again. This back and forth of CCIP messages between chains will continue to happen as the gamers make their moves until the game reaches a conclusion and a winner is declared. The important thing to note here is that the game smart contracts on both chains both maintain the game state, with CCIP being used to send and receive messages to ensure game state is maintained across both blockchains:The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Tic-Tac-Toe GitHub repository.\n\nFrom cross-chain DeFi and NFTs to games that run across multiple blockchains, CCIP enables the realization of cross-chain smart contracts, true DeFi composability across all blockchains, and a much more unified Web3.\n\nIf you are building a cross-chain application that uses CCIP, we would love to hear about it.

    "content": "Hyped Base meme coin normie (NORMIE) plunged 99% on Sunday after being hit by an exploit that saw attackers manipulate the token’s total supply, completely draining its liquidity pools.\n\nBlockchain sleuths said attackers exploited a so-called tax function in the token’s contract to issue more tokens than the intended 1 billion supply. The extra tokens were then traded for ether.\n\nIn an on-chain message late on Sunday, the attacker offered Normie developers a way to receive 90% of the stolen funds back if they agreed to relaunch the project.\n\n“I offer to return 90% of the exploited ETH, keeping 10% as a bug bounty (with no reprisals,” the on-chain message reads. “One condition: it, and the 600 ETH in the dev wallet, are used to fairly launch a new token that is used to reimburse NORMIE holders.”\n\nSix hundred ether is worth nearly $2.3 million at current prices. The move marked one of the first instances of an attacker keeping a project relaunch as a condition to return funds. Normie developers accepted the bounty offer as of early Monday, messages on the project\u0027s official Telegram group viewed by CoinDesk showed.\n\nIn another on-chain message in Asian morning hours on Monday, the attacker called Normie’s contract code a “copy-paste” job which was likely not thoroughly reviewed by its developers prior to being pushed live.\n\n“This exact code is present in a number of other token contracts, a few of which significantly pre-date Normie. Most meme tokens are simply copy-paste jobs from the same small set of contracts, all with over-complicated tax logic in the transfer function,” the attacker said.\n\n“I suspect this simply a case of them re-using code they didn\u0027t thoroughly review,” they added. Before the dump, NORMIE was among the top meme coins on Base with a market capitalization of over $40 million and nearly 90,000 on-chain token holders, as per DEXTools metrics. Normie is slang for a “normal person,” and the Base version was modeled after a blue coloured frog that resembled the popular Pepe the Frog character.\n\nIt sits at a market capitalization of just $700 as of early Monday following the exploit.\n\nMeanwhile, at least one NORMIE investor faced a massive loss due to the attack, with their $1.6 million in investment turning to just $150 in seconds.\n\n“Since $NORMIE was exploited, the 11.23M $NORMIE that this trader spent $1.16M to buy is now worth less than $150,” analysis firm Lookonchain posted on X. “He spent $1.16M to buy 11.23M $NORMIE at $0.1035 from Mar 25 to Apr 9 and has held it until now without selling it.”\n\nNormie’s X has been suspended as of early Asian hours on Monday.\n\n",

    "summary": "Author Zachary Small details the behind-the-scenes events that brought the digital artist and Christie\u0027s auction house together in the first chapter of their book.\n\n",
    "content": "Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christie’s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmann’s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreography of this historic moment.\n\nZachary Small, a New York Times reporter writing about the art world\u0027s relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of \"Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,\" published by Penguin Random House.\n\nThe artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.\n\nOnce upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailor’s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value of compartmentalization, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.\n\nThe computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmann’s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming “boring as sh*t.” The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrative short films through a webcam than working for a software company. The Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.\n\nIn 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The \"Everydays\" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nA recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trump’s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.\n\nSee also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?\n\nAll that chaos was contained in Winkelmann’s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, and two 65-inch screen televisions that played CNN and Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internet’s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?\n\nBeeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway. One piece was called \"Politics Is Bullshit,\" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.\n\n“If you need extra convincing from some BS artist’s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,” Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. “Smash the buy button ya jabroni.”\n\nPoof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price – decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever – Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue for financializing his digital art, one that built upon the lucrative market for online collectibles that companies like Dapper Labs and Larva Labs had started in 2017 with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: “There’s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,” he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. “We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.”\n\nWinkelmann’s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy companies.\n\nThey wanted permanence. They wanted cultural capital.\n\nIn 2017, Christie’s made a Renaissance painting the marquee lot in their November sale of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artwork’s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown prince’s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.\n\nRestructuring continued in 2020, as Christie’s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departments into one office. “Our clients don’t think in categories anymore,” Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.\n\nThe decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s – shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.\n\nIronically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that Christie’s announced that its top lot for the \"20th Century Evening Sale\" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.\n\nMany employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.\n\nSee also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He\u0027s Writing About It\n\n“I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,” Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another competing over the bragging rights of ownership. Connoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.\n\n“All I know is that I know nothing,” Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called “Knowledge” by the California punk band Operation Ivy.\n\nSo, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. “It will be fun and a little weird,” he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the perfect auction. But the most important detail was still missing: what was Beeple going to make? The artist had originally suggested one of his \"Everydays\" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.\n\n“Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,” Doyle said, declining the proposal.\n\nWinkelmann returned with a new idea. “I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,” he remembered. “And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.” Instead of offering a single work, he decided to combine everything he had created over the last fourteen years into a single composite, sold as an NFT.\n\n“He came back to us with a magnum opus,” Doyle said. “With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.”\n\nHowever, Ito found the level of involvement from Christie’s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors – “whales,” as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.\n\nIn January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metaverse to celebrate his $2.2-million purchase of twenty Beeple NFTs and the opening of a gallery that he had commissioned Web architects to build in the online world of Origin City. Back then, he was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into “King of Meta.”\n\nSundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of “Bitcoin ATMs,” which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.\n\nIn 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digital real-estate market. A year later, he started using the name MetaKovan, which he describes as his “exosuit” created for “building the metaverse.”\n\nAt the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverse’s first large-scale public art project.\n\n“We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,” the company said in its newsletter. “Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.”\n\nIto had been watching Sundaresan for a while; he understood how the crypto millionaire operated and that he had an affinity for the guttural sci-fi fantasies that Beeple was selling. More important, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.\n\nGradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christie’s “know your customer” process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse – another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran – who played more of a backseat advisory role in the acquisition process.\n\nThe marketing juggernaut at Christie’s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmann’s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event with its own subtitle, like an Avengers movie – \"Everydays: The First 5000 Days.\" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write “estimate unknown,” a cheeky nod to the usual “inquire for estimate” phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.\n\n“Estimate unknown.” That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasn’t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.\n\n“Noah looked at me and said, ‘We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,’ ” Winkelmann recalled.\n\nCompliance officers and executives at Christie’s were still debating the financial terms of the deal. The original plan was for the house to accept cryptocurrency for the hammer price but require that its own premium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.\n\nSuccess needed to be measured with the company’s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.\n\n“A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,” Doyle said. “The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.”\n\nThe gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his participation in the auction, but what nobody expected was another competitor willing to participate in one of the most furious online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.\n\nOn February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.\n\n“I was shocked that our website could handle it,” Doyle said. “I had never seen that happen.”\n\nThe auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christie’s. Most were millennials.\n\nSee also: What\u0027s Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?\n\n“It was a psychotic amount of bidding,” Davis thought as his phone started blowing up with messages. His boss, Alex Rotter, head of 20th-and-21st-century art, even took to social media to brag about the sale. He posted a Beeple artwork to his Instagram featuring a superpowered Homer Simpson lobotomizing his son, Bart Simpson, with laser vision.\n\n“Beeple leads the way,” Rotter captioned the image. “It’s all happening.”\n\nThis excerpt has been lightly edited.\n\n",

The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index that tracks the biggest tokens, fell 4.5% over 24 hours and the crypto market cap lost 2.9% to $2.5 trillion.\n\n“Ethereum\u0027s sell-off on positive news is a typical \"buy the rumors, sell the facts\" reaction of speculators,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. “We shouldn\u0027t be surprised if the price pulls back to the $3000 area again, returning to an important consolidation area. From these levels, large institutional investors can start building a position in ETFs.\n\n“We saw the same in January after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, which took 19% off its price in the following two weeks before there was a spectacular reversal,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved key regulatory filings tied to ether ETFs, a historic milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency. They are not, however, cleared to trade. Although the SEC approved the 19B-4 form that allows for the offering and listing of ETFs, it must still green light the funds\u0027 S-1 filings before investors can buy them.\n\nThe regulator approved documents for eight ETFs – from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy and BlackRock – for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.\n\nIf the ETFs are approved for trading, a significant influx of institutional capital is likely. Standard Chartered predicted inflows of as much as $45 billion in the first 12 months.\n\nSome traders say they expect ether to rally over 60% in the coming months, with a marked increase in futures and spot buying demand for the token in the past week.\n\n",

    "content": "A bunch of Ethereum ecosystem tokens rocketed in the past 24 hours after two Bloomberg analysts raised their odds on the approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nThe cat-themed mog (MOG) token, a reference to a popular TikTok meme, rose nearly 50% while the frog-themed pepe (PEPE) surged more than 20%. Both were initially issued on Ethereum in 2023 and have since become mainstays, alongside bigger ones such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nAmong utility projects, staking application Lido’s LDO rose 15%, while the ARB token of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum jumped 18%. DOGE and SHIB added 6%.\n\nMeme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\n“Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),” a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.\n\n“I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\nThe focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn\u0027t unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto proponents used to posit that \"code is law.\" Courts and legal pundits ultimately forced the phrase into retirement. But there\u0027s still plenty of money in figuring out how the two intertwine.\n\nOne such effort is crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro\u0027s MetaLeX, a hybrid law firm/tech company focused on the mess that crypto projects make when trying to \"decentralize.\" MetaLeX recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding led by Cyber Fund. It is now valued at $27.5 million, Shapiro said.\n\nUnlike their \"centralized\" counterparts in the traditional business world, many crypto projects seek to \"decentralize\" by giving their tokenholders control of budgets and other core operations. It\u0027s a costly, cumbersome, failure-prone journey that has bedeviled major DeFi players like SushiSwap and often leaves the organization open to make arbitrary decisions that break their own ethos.\n\nInto this fray steps Shapiro\u0027s incredibly niche MetaLeX. In an interview with CoinDesk, he described it as a \"business-to-business, crypto software as a services\" company that\u0027s designing standardized, smart contract-based processes for so-called decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, to properly run themselves on-chain.\n\nIn MetaLeX lingo, the name for this newfangled construct is a Cybernetic Organization, or BORG. Think of it as a cyborg equivalent for legal entities. They\u0027ll be governed by hard-coded, smart contract-enforced rules infused into their charters, according to the project whitepaper.\n\n\"What makes them kind of unique is the way they mandate smart contract functionality\" in their operations,\" Shapiro said. \"That makes them \u0027cybernetic.\u0027\"\n\nMetaLeX\u0027s first product will be an operating system for DAOs to BORGify their governance decision processes with constructs to run grantmaking, emergency shutdowns and venture investments made on behalf of the entity, he said.\n\nCrypto projects are reaching out \"every day\" to join the waitlist for MetaLeX OS, Shapiro said, including two \"blue chip\" projects, though he declined to identify them beyond saying they were a layer-2 blockchain and a \"traditional DeFi DAO.\"\n\n\"They both want to fully BORGify their operations,\" he said.\n\nNot every crypto project can be easily BORGified. Those that have already launched tokens and DAO governance processes are more difficult to work with than pre-token projects, Shapiro said.\n\nMetaLeX is not itself a BORG or a DAO or anything that crypto-native. It\u0027s an umbrella brand for a Delaware corporation (the tech company) and a Texas limited liability partnership (the law firm led by Shapiro and Alex Golubitsky). Clients could use one or both, Shapiro said.\n\nMetaLeX could one day have its own token if it evolves to become a legal protocol that requires governance by its customers, Shapiro said.\n\n\"It will probably take a while before we would get to that point. But ultimately I think it will get there,\" he said.\n\n",

    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\n\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\n\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n\n“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\n\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\n\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\n\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.\n\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\n\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n\n“Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\n\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n\n",

Trump has pledged to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence to time served if he’s re-elected president.\n\n“If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,” Trump said during his Saturday night remarks at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, D.C. “He’s already served 11 years, we’re gonna get him home.”\n\nHours before those remarks, Trump took to social media to praise the crypto industry, writing on Truth Social:\n\n“I am very positive and open minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field. There is no second place,” Trump wrote, adding that President Joe Biden “wants [the cryptocurrency industry] to die a slow and painful death. That will never happen with me!”\n\nIn his evening address, Trump’s pledge to free Ulbricht was met with raucous cheers from the assembled audience, many of whom were holding up signs reading “Free Ross.”\n\nIn 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus 40 years – effectively, life in prison without the possibility of parole – for creating and operating Silk Road. The now-defunct darknet marketplace was used to anonymously buy and sell goods, but was largely used for drugs. Silk Road operated from 2011 to 2013 and is widely considered the first real-world use case for Bitcoin.\n\nUlbricht has become something of a martyr for many in the crypto community, as well as to many Libertarians, who see Ulbricht’s draconian sentence as a governmental overstep and a violation of his constitutional rights. In 2018, the Libertarian Party called on then-President Trump to pardon Ulbricht.\n\nBefore Trump’s presidency ended in January 2021, he granted clemency to 143 individuals – pardoning 73, including Ripple board member Ken Kurson, and commuting the sentences of 70 others. He did not offer clemency to Ulbricht, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, who released details about a U.S. surveillance program to American journalist Glenn Greenwald.\n\nTrump also made more general comments about cryptocurrency at the convention, telling attendees that he would “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush crypto – we’re gonna stop it.”\n\n“I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. I will support the right to self custody,” Trump said, to cheers. “To the nation’s fifty million crypto holders, I say this: I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”\n\nTrump has warmed up considerably to crypto in recent months, making several pro-crypto comments publicly and becoming the first major party presidential candidate to accept crypto donations.\n\nRead more: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\n",

    "summary": "By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, Montclair State University adjunct professor Burak Tamac writes.\n\n",
    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\n\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\n\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.\n\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\n\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\n\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\n\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\n\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\n\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\n\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n\n",

The round was led by Haun Ventures and included participation from Galaxy Ventures, Superscrypt, A Capital, SV Angel, Portal Ventures and Reciprocal Ventures.\n\nPlume\u0027s Ethereum-based blockchain is pitched as a one-stop shop for easily bringing off-chain assets onto blockchains, meaning the protocol helps people navigate the morass of paperwork, custodial requirements and other legwork required to bring things like real estate, art and certain kinds of financial instruments onto blockchains.\n\n\"The RWA industry is one of the fastest-growing verticals in crypto today but there remains a critical gap – to date there has not been a permissionless blockchain equipped with fullstack RWA infrastructure to deploy any asset class compliantly,\" the company explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. \"The robust DeFi ecosystem on Plume enables users to do everything with RWAs – from earning yield, borrowing/lending, trading and speculating with leverage.\"\n\nPlume\u0027s underlying technology is based on Arbitrum Nitro – a framework for building layer-2 \"rollup\" chains that write transactions to Ethereum quickly and with low fees. The tech should make it simple for the chain to interoperate and swap assets across other chains in the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem – a constellation of other rollups built using the same framework.\n\n\"When we started talking to protocols, everyone said the same thing: \u0027It takes us anywhere between six months, a year, a year and a half, two years to actually get this asset on-chain before we can even write a single line of code for our protocol,\u0027\" Plume co-founder Chris Yin said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"That\u0027s just a ridiculous way to do things – it\u0027s just duplicative work across every single protocol. We say, let\u0027s standardize that.\"\n\nOn Plume, \"you have a very comprehensive set of features to actually tokenize an asset – meaning setting up your entity, filing the stuff, taking custody of the assets, doing wallets, automatic set-up, cap table management, on/off-ramping, [know-your-customer] – all of those things are baked in,\" said Yin. \"We just take these products, we integrate them and put a nice UI on it and make sure that it\u0027s nicely modular.\"\n\nAccording to Yin, Plume currently has more than 80 projects deploying real-world assets onto its private test network. \"Everything from collectibles, private credit, real estate – all these things are deploying on Plume,\" he said.\n\nYin says Plume plans to open up its testnet to the public within \"a month or so,\" with a full release to follow later on.\n\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "content": "A single picture on Monday sparked rallies across some cat-themed meme coins and Gamestop stock (NYSE: GME) as market cults heralded the apparent return of TheRoaringKitty, the X profile of retail trader Keith Gill, who made his first post since late 2021.\n\nGill posted a meme that refers to a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration. Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\n\nStocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.\n\nAn unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.\n\nGill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\n\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\n\nGill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n\n",

    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "One of the most powerful women in finance talks to CoinDesk ahead of her Consensus appearance.\n\n",
    "content": "Nadine Chakar is often called one the most powerful women in finance. As global head of the digital asset wing at DTCC, which settles an astronomical amount of transactions annually (in the quadrillions), she has a front row seat to how technology is reinventing finance before our very eyes. Which might be why she’s become such a staunch advocate for blockchain-based innovations. Nadine Chakar is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\n“With tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business models and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels. Firms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing processes while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity – and they can likely do it cheaper and faster,” Chakar wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.\n\nChakar, who has over 30 years of experience of global wealth and asset management experience, has essentially charted her own path through the world of finance. Before DTCC (which acquired her compliance-focused tokenization firm Securrency in 2023), Chakar served as an executive vice president at State Street, where she essentially built out the State Street Digital unit after a stint as executive vice president of the firm’s global markets division.\n\n“This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation,” Chakar said in an interview.\n\nSee also: What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Chakar to discuss her career history, how she views digital transformation and what responsible regulation for crypto would look like.\n\nTo what extent did your career at places like State Street Digital and BNY Mellon prepare you to lead the digital asset business at DTCC?\n\nI have a history of working at heavily-regulated financial institutions, which has given me expertise leading teams that can innovate in a responsible, transparent way that meets the highest regulatory standards. However, given my time as CEO of Securrency, I’ve witnessed the power of a fintech that can innovate quickly. This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation.\n\nNow that Securrency has become DTCC Digital Assets, I believe we’re leveraging the best of both worlds. We combine DTCC’s legacy of trust and experience as the infrastructure for the world’s largest capital markets with Securrency best-in-class technology capabilities.\n\nAre you observing digital assets impacting traditional financial markets?\n\nI believe digital assets are largely operating in a different universe from traditional markets. However, I think we’re at a turning point where the two are starting to converge. A major challenge is that innovation continues to occur in siloes, where financial institutions will team up with a fintech [company] to launch a pilot, only to culminate with a press release and then fizzle out afterward.\n\nWe’re calling for a change in approach: we should focus on large-scale pilots with many participants and have experiments build upon each other incrementally to begin building a larger, interoperable digital asset ecosystem that can power digital markets.\n\nIt\u0027s often said that market structure for digital assets needs reform: Do you have ideas of what this should look like?\n\nWe require an ecosystem for digital assets that’s worthy of the one we have for traditional assets today. First and foremost, we need infrastructure that can connect traditional systems with the digital ecosystem and that provides the same level of soundness and safety of existing offerings. Second, we must ensure we’re facilitating how assets and processes can move across multiple blockchains.\n\nThird, we must have a clear legal and regulatory framework to establish controls and standards. This is essential, and it should include standards for data, including its use and collection, methods to protect private data and establishing exactly what data is allowed on-chain.\n\nSee also: A Crypto Developer\u0027s Guide to Consensus 2024\n\nOf course, DTCC has been bringing this sort of expertise to the markets for over 50 years. We have the established ecosystem for traditional securities, which will serve as the foundation for creating the digital infrastructure of the future. We are also here to help guide the evolution of the regulatory framework over time to support digital assets.\n\nWe can’t do it alone. This is why we’ve partnered with other financial market infrastructures, Euroclear and Clearstream, to issue a new paper that lays out the path forward for developing this ecosystem in a measured and collaborative way. We’re excited to announce the paper at Consensus.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nNetworking and connecting with colleagues. It’s worth repeating: the path to creating the digital asset ecosystem starts with collaboration. While there will always be room for firms to compete with their own bright ideas and compelling use cases, we won’t make meaningful progress on tokenization without working together. I’m excited for the industry to collaborate to bring a robust, interoperable digital asset ecosystem to life.\n\n",

SOL, XRP), markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story, not a 2024 one,” analyst Geoffrey Kendric said. “For now, bitcoin and ether dominance will rise, with selective “next in line” winners as well.”\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved forms 19b-4 filed by would-be issuers. While this is an important step in the race to launch a spot ether ETF, it is only one of two forms that needs approval from the regulator.\n\nIt could take the SEC weeks if not months – even potentially indefinitely – to approve the S-1 document, which has so far only been filed by a few potential issuers.\n\nSeveral industry experts have suggested that SOL would be a logical choice for a third ETF, given its similarities to Ethereum.\n\nBrokerage firm Bernstein said in a note on Thursday that given Ethereum’s classification as a commodity, the token could follow a similar path. Solana is the third biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether by market cap. This is excluding stablecoin Tether (USDT) and Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nCORRECTION (May 24, 2024, 15:14 UTC): Fixes XRP\u0027s ticker symbol in the headline.\n\n",

    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\n\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\n\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\n\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\n\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\n\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\n\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n\n",

    "content": "The newest product from liquid restaking startup Ether.fi could finally help \"paper rich\" crypto degens turn their blockchain investments into spending money.\n\nEther.fi Cash will be a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that borrows USDC, the popular USD-pegged stablecoin, against one\u0027s decentralized finance (DeFi) investments and can be paid off directly via crypto.\n\n\"Our mission is to build a suite of integrated apps that make DeFi actually usable for normal people,\" said Ether.fi founder Mike Silagadze. \"Cash is your spending account, with the dream being that you never have to off-ramp\" from the blockchain. \"Off-ramping\" refers to the tedious (and fee-laden) process of converting between cash and crypto.\n\nToday, Ether.fi is best known as a service for funneling assets into EigenLayer, the Ethereum-based restaking giant that helps investors secure upstart blockchain services in exchange for rewards. EigenLayer has drawn in some $18 billion worth of deposits over the past year, with over $5.5 billion coming from users who initially deposited their money into Ether.fi in exchange for eETH tokens – a kind of receipt on EigenLayer deposits that can be traded in crypto markets like any other asset.\n\nRead more: With Mastercard, MetaMask Tests First Blockchain-Powered Payment Card\n\nIn addition to its \"Stake\" program, Ether.fi also has a \"Liquid\" program, where users can deposit their funds into vaults that follow hand-curated trading strategies.\n\nEther.fi Cash cardholders will be able to borrow funds against their Stake or Liquid deposits and use the interest from those investments to automatically pay off their bills. Users can alternatively convert assets directly into USDC, allowing for instant settlement.\n\nWith Cash, \"you on-ramp once onto Ether.fi and then you never have to off-ramp again because you can save, invest, and spend all your money,\" said Silagadze. \"You can get paid in crypto, and you can just live your life normally without plugging into the TradFi ecosystem.\" Ether.fi aims to offer a crypto-centric rewards program akin to those offered by Chase and other legacy card providers. It also aims to differentiate itself from traditional credit cards through its fee structure, which will follow the DeFi market rather than the standard 15-30% APR charged by regular credit cards.\n\nCash is not the first swing at a crypto-based card, but Silagadze insists that previous attempts to build similar products have amounted to \"garbage.\"\n\n\"Most of them are Visa debit cards,\" he said. \"Visa debit cards are pointless because you can only use them for, like, hotels and car rentals. You can\u0027t use them for a lot of stuff. They\u0027re just not practical.\"\n\n\"This is an actual credit card,\" Silagadze emphasized.\n\nHe expects Cash to roll out to consumers starting in September, but it is unlikely, for regulatory reasons, to be available in certain large markets, including the U.S..\n\nUsing crypto as cash will always have its unique complexities – from market considerations to tax implications.\n\n\"Initially, this is designed for crypto natives,\" said Silagadze, \"But if somebody is thinking of becoming a proper degen, looking at something like this might make them feel like, \u0027Alright, this actually helps me navigate this universe.\u0027\"\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\n\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\n\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\n\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\n\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\n\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\n\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\n\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\n\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\n\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\n\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\n\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\n\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\n\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\n\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\n\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\n\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.\n\nOther majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano\u0027s ADA, Solana\u0027s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.\n\nShorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u0027s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u0027s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nMarkets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.\n\nMarket participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.\n\n“Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.”\n\n",

    "title": "3 Questions About the SEC’s Abrupt ETH ETF Approval\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Was the decision politically motivated? What does it mean for Ethereum going forward? Will other leading chains benefit too?\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed yesterday it has approved critical rule changes to allow for exchange-traded funds holding Ethereum’s native token, ETH. A lot of people were caught off guard, considering that just last week nearly everyone – from Bloomberg analysts to prediction markets – thought it was a lost cause.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nIt never really made sense to me why SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would hold out on approving these spot ETH products, considering how the agency was embarrassed during its proactive fight over listing bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRecall that a three-person panel of judges in an appeals court called the SEC’s reasoning for denying (and denying and denying) spot bitcoin funds “arbitrary and capricious,” as it had already approved bitcoin futures products that did substantially the same thing. The same situation has been true for ETH as well, and it’s likely that some firm would have been happy to litigate the matter in the same way Digital Currency Group went to bat for bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis time around, the SEC’s decision seems just as arbitrary, just in the opposite direction. In an interview with CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton hours before the approval became public, Gensler said he’d follow “how the courts interpret the law” and that the “DC Circuit took a different view, and we took that into consideration and pivoted.”\n\nSee also: Ether ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn\u0027t Cleared Them for Trading Yet\n\nSo why now? What does it mean for Ethereum going forward? And does this bode well for other cryptos?\n\nAs many have already noted, it appears there has been a seachange regarding crypto’s regulatory situation. On Thursday, the House took a historic vote to approve the most substantive piece of crypto-specific legislation to date. This came on the heels of both the upper and lower houses of Congress voting to repeal a controversial SEC crypto custody accounting rule.\n\nWith significant participation from Democrats in both bills, it appears that the U.S. government’s long war on crypto is nearing an end. Notably, President Biden announced that he wouldn’t veto the crypto market structure bill, FIT21, which the White House officially opposes – a pretty major concession.\n\nIt’s possible that all these events on the Hill acted like a temperature check, and helped convince Gensler that his approach to crypto was becoming a political hazard. Afterall, former President Donald Trump did just announce his support for crypto in a big way – and denying ETH ETFs on the basis, purportedly, that the SEC wasn’t having “productive” meetings with applicants would be great ammunition.\n\nTo be sure, the SEC didn’t approve ETH ETFs to actually list anytime soon – just the Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq’s 19b-4 proposals, which would allow them to list the funds once firms like Ark Invest, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others, get their S-1 filings approved. That could take months.\n\nWell first off, the launch of spot ETH funds means that there may soon be a lot more institutional interest in the second largest cryptocurrency. Not only did the move act as a sort of stamp of approval, it will also create a familiar on-ramp for buying the asset for anyone from mom and pop investors looking to diversify their 401(k)s to hedge funds, much in the same way ETFs did for bitcoin.\n\n“A lot of people have been caught offside by the Ethereum ETF announcement. Even though the Bitcoin ETF created a crypto ETF roadmap for wirehouses and large registered investment advisors, I still expect that many institutional stakeholders are now scrambling to prime their sales teams on the state of Ethereum and put together the proper infrastructure,” Framework Ventures co-founder Michael Anderson said in an emailed statement.\n\nAnd while ETFs are really just a vehicle for gaining exposure to an underlying asset, it is also possible that these funds will actually drive more users onto Ethereum itself. One scenario: because the SEC likely won’t allow fund managers to stake the underlying ETH, it’s possible new ether investors determine that they want to do it themselves to earn that extra ~3.5% yield.\n\nRelatedly, as Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted on X, the approval likely answers one lingering question: whether or not ETH is a security. Chervinsky said, if these funds are allowed to trade, it would likely mean that unstaked ETH, in particular, isn’t viewed as a security at the agency. That in itself may spur more institutions into the market, considering that many are currently holding off simply due to regulatory uncertainty.\n\nOn a more technical level, there are many open questions about what it would mean for Ethereum in a world where these funds buy up vast quantities of ETH (assuming they’re as popular) as the bitcoin ETFs. To some degree, the buying pressure would be great for the network and surrounding layer 2s.\n\nEthereum instituted a burn mechanism that destroys tokens with every transaction, which for a long time made the asset class deflationary. But, with the growing popularity of L2s and alternative chains like Solana, Ethereum transaction volumes have dropped to such a degree that the supply of ETH is growing again, which raises long term implications for the asset’s price and demand. The ETFs could help support the economics of ETH.\n\nSee also: Ethereum ETF Approval Could Spur 60% ETH Rally as\n\nFinally, it will be interesting to see how the funds affect the staking economy. Some people have been ringing alarm bells about the amount of staked ETH, now that applications like Lido make it very easy for people to lock up even tiny quantities of the crypto. With the possibility ETFs pull even more ETH out of circulation, these concerns may be compounded.\n\nAs mentioned, the approval of ETH ETFs is something of an endorsement for Ethereum, and likely an opportunity for the chain to lock in its already dominant brand position.\n\n“Assuming the Ethereum ETF sees even a fraction of the institutional flows that the Bitcoin ETF saw, I think it\u0027s entirely possible that Ethereum will be solidified as the uncontested leader in decentralized app platforms for the next several years, at least in terms of market share and valuation,” Anderson said.\n\nBut the move may also open the door for alternative chains like Cardano, Solana and Ripple to also enter further into the world of high finance. Of course, bitcoin and ETH had an easier time (all in perspective) because financial incumbents like CME had already embraced them. Ether futures have been live on CME for three years already, while it’s not even clear whether other crypto assets are being considered.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, while the SEC has hinted it thinks ETH is a security, the agency has proactively come out and said that assets like SOL, ADA and ALGO fit the definition outlined by the Howey Test used to determine whether something is an investment contract. This may be a speed-bump in the road towards a spot SOL ETF.\n\n",

Sonic will have the \"ability to withdraw funds on Ethereum independently,\" and will generate a proof \"for every asset bridged from Ethereum to Sonic chain,\" said Michael Kong, CEO of Fantom Foundation, in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nSonic will be \"greatly superior in terms of speed and security compared to the Fantom chain. Over time, we anticipate that users and developers will fully migrate to the Sonic chain,\" Kong added.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Fantom Foundation, Sonic Foundation will be responsible for the governance of the Sonic ecosystem as well as its treasury. Sonic Labs will focus on decentralized applications and the community for the Sonic network.\n\nThe Fantom team also shared that once the Sonic chain goes live, expected sometime this year, the network will have its own native token, $S, “which will be 1:1 compatible with Fantom’s existing $FTM token after a recent governance vote codifying the two tokens\u0027 interoperability.”\n\nAlongside the news about the new Sonic entities, Fantom shared that it closed a $10 million funding round led by Hashed, which will go towards growing Sonic’s ecosystem and product.\n\nSonic Foundation and Sonic Labs will not officially start working until the Sonic chain is up and running.\n\n“I\u0027m incredibly grateful to our investors for their belief in our vision for Sonic and for our dedicated team for their hard work and commitment to ensuring a smooth rebranding process,” said Kong in the press release. “We will continue our legacy of efficacy, transparency, and loyalty to our community in this next stage of the protocol. ”\n\nRead more: Fantom Seeks Money Back From Multichain’s $200M Exploit\n\n",

First, the former president made pro-crypto comments earlier this month at a Mar-a-Lago dinner. Then this past Tuesday, Trump\u0027s presidential campaign began accepting crypto donations, making good on the presumptive Republican nominee\u0027s pledge to become the first major party candidate to embrace bitcoin, ether and other digital currencies.\n\nFollowing Trump\u0027s pro-crypto rhetoric and actions, the Biden administration\u0027s opposition to crypto as well as the attitude of the traditionally crypto-adverse Securities and Exchange Commission appear to have softened. Last Wednesday, the White House issued a statement expressing its opposition to the House of Representatives passing a crypto market structure bill, but Biden didn\u0027t threaten a veto. The House proceeded to approve the measure, which now heads to the Senate. Then on Thursday, the ether exchange traded funds (ETF) took a major step toward becoming available in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved key regulatory filings. Such an approval was seen as extremely unlikely just a month ago.\n\nRead more: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\n",

    "summary": "Here are some ways users and developers, the lifeblood of crypto, can help move better legislation through Congress, writes Rebecca Rettig, Chief Legal \u0026 Policy Officer at Polygon Labs.\n\nPolicy is a doing word. Engaging in policy work means talking, advocating, explaining, teaching, and, most importantly, building relationships.\n\nStorytelling matters. Being able to tell your story—whether as a developer or user — in a clear and straightforward way that addresses the direct impact of blockchain goes a long way.\n\nThe legislative process takes time.\n\n",
    "content": "If you told me when I got into the blockchain space more than seven years ago that key pieces of sweeping market structure legislation for crypto would be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, I wouldn’t have believed it.\n\nBack then, crypto was a nascent technology viewed as “niche” or “off the beaten path.” As a lawyer in private practice advising software developers building innovative, cutting edge technology, I worked exclusively behind the scenes on novel legal questions for this emerging sector.\n\nRebecca Rettig is a speaker at this year\u0027s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\nWe’re in a different world now. The concept of blockchain has greater cultural relevance than ever before, driven forward by evangelists and developers building on the margins.\n\nAdvocates see blockchain-based technology as transformative, with the ability to redefine not only how we engage in financial transactions, but also all internet-based interactions. Crypto brings the possibility of a new, decentralized internet to center stage in many ways, and global policymakers and regulators have trained their attention on what to do with this new industry like never before.\n\nPolicymakers and regulators are grappling with definitional and threshold questions of whether and how to regulate. What does it mean for a software system to be decentralized? When do potential financial risks emanate from cyber-security threats, and how do we mitigate such risks? What is necessary to ensure the overall integrity of the system?\n\nA huge shift is underway in helping educate lawmakers on how to answer these questions. The policy arm of the industry has focused and professionalized as rapidly as the technology has developed. This may make advocacy seem esoteric and removed for those who are actually building and using the technology. But the time for builders and users to get involved in educating and working with lawmakers is now. This is more true than ever after the passage of the first market structure bill for crypto passed the House yesterday with a bipartisan vote.\n\nAs builders in this space, you have unique knowledge and insights in how this technology works and why it is an unprecedented reorientation of what the internet can look like. Grassroots efforts play an essential role in advocating for crypto and I have heard time and again from members of Congress that you’re exactly who they want to hear from. The point of advocacy is to help regulators tap knowledge workers and enthusiasts who have the information that can help craft polity.\n\nSo how can you get started? There are a couple easy ways to engage.\n\nA number of organizations have been established specifically to give you the tools you need to advocate most effectively. Example? Crypto Policy Bootcamp.\n\nIn October 2023, Polygon Labs, Solana Foundation and DeFi Education Fund co-hosted the first Crypto Policy Bootcamp. The event brought together founders, CEOs, VCs, and other stakeholders to engage with policy experts, political advocates, and Congressional staffers and members of Congress. Discussions centered on how to talk about the value of blockchain technology. Through the various panels and accompanying dialogue, the bootcamp produced many takeaways, including:\n\nSince October, we’ve hosted four additional bootcamps alongside others in the industry including Wormhole Foundation and Ledger, with the fifth coming at the end of May at Consensus. And the stage is set for one of the strongest crypto advocates in Congress, Tom Emmer, to take time out to speak to Bootcamp attendees in Austin.\n\nThese bootcamps aim to make policy work accessible to anyone by equipping those building, investing, or working in the space with the tools and resources they need to effectively advocate for the evolution of the blockchain industry, ecosystem, and community on the Hill and beyond. And it is one of many fantastic ways to get the tools to get involved; there are organizations, such as Stand With Crypto, that are dedicated to this task, bringing builders together in D.C. and beyond to advocate.\n\nSpeaking directly to policymakers, especially your own Congressional representatives, has an unquestionably high impact.\n\nEven better when you can also tell your story. This can take many different forms: calling, writing letters, setting up meetings.\n\nThere are also a number of tools that aggregate stories and help educate lawmakers, which you can use to provide your own compelling testimony. Along with the community, Ihelped launch an open, interactive website, The Value Prop (TVP), which aggregates blockchain-based applications into a simple database. It showcases everything from community-built GPS and hotspot networks to tracking supply chains to online verification of digital records and information.\n\nThe effort took place over many months, with the enthusiastic community members submitting hundreds of use cases. As a result, TVP has become a mainstay of grassroots clarity for decision makers: policymakers and regulators use it as a resource.\n\nContributors from the crypto community like the Ethereum Foundation, Celo Foundation, and Mercy Corps Ventures, have elevated the site further. Now it features video testimonials of builders and founders discussing what they’re creating, why they’re doing it, and the impact of their work.\n\nWhat The Value Prop needs now more than ever are user testimonials. These testimonials bring to life the people actually using crypto, and the positive impact it’s made on their lives.\n\nTo that end, core team members of Polygon Labs will want to hear what you have to say! At Consensus on May 30, we’ll be interviewing users who want to testify about how they use this tech, why, and what it’s made of their life.\n\nYou — the builders and the users — are the lifeblood of the industry. You’re the most important voices that can be heard on policy issues.\n\nStart engaging.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be with trips to DC or even to your representatives office in your home state. You can engage from the busy Austin streets during Consensus, by filming a user testimony.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A year ago, “Crypto+AI” sounded like a game of “VC mad libs.” Now, as real-world applications begin to emerge, the idea makes much more sense. Jeff Wilser, who is hosting the AI Summit at Consensus 2024, offers a preview of the programming and reviews the decentralized AI state-of-play.\n\n",
    "content": "Almost exactly one year ago, I wrote a piece for CoinDesk called 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse). At the time, the idea of “Crypto + AI” was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent — at best — to the world of Web3. To others, “Crypto + AI” felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.\n\nFlash forward one year.\n\nDecentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects — maybe hundreds, it’s hard to keep track — are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk’s inaugural “AI Summit.” (I’ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I’ll be hosting on May 31.)\n\nSo why is this happening, and why does it matter?\n\nYou could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people’s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives — and that feels inevitable — it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?\n\nLet’s look at two concrete examples, one that’s straightforward and one that’s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (“Hey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S\u0026P.”)\n\nDo we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?\n\nMore chilling: It’s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots — perhaps through audio or even video — as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who’s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It’s coming. It’s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.\n\nThese are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make “AI compute” more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)\n\nWhile an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. “My initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in ’95 or ’96, when the internet became a thing,” Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. “It seemed to me, the internet shouldn’t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?” The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book “Creating Internet Intelligence” that fuses all these concepts.\n\nGoertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.\n\nGensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. “We’re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,” Gensyn’s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, “You don’t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.” (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)\n\nWhile many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.\n\nIn a Twitter/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but “without all the Orwellian stuff” and that “Venice doesn’t spy on you,” “Venice doesn’t censor your conversation,” and “Venice doesn’t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.” Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, “There are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.” Shots fired.\n\nVoorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there’s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter/X post explained that “Filecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.”\n\nOne reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there’s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn’t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren’t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.\n\n“The power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who’s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. “And greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.”\n\nNone of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it’s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The rise of Farcaster and portable “social graphs” will change the relationship between brand marketers and end-users, says the founder of JUMP, a network for Web3 branding executives.\n\n",
    "content": "Through each stepchange in technology, marketing has continually evolved. What started in the early days of Mesopotamia and Egypt, with merchants advertising their goods using symbols and signs on stalls, has become a complex global industry, constantly adapting to communications innovation.\n\nThis op-ed is part of CoinDesk\u0027s Web3 Marketing Week.\n\nWhen it comes to Web3, the latest innovation, Jeff Kauffman knows his stuff. Starting out early in the days of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, Kauffman built brand communities for clients like GameStop, Dr. Pepper and Chick-fil-A. He later founded JUMP, a network for branding executives curious about Web 3, which has drawn brand managers from at least 200 Fortune 500 companies.\n\n“With Web3, you now have this on-chain touchpoint relationship and experience and that’s the biggest difference, that there is this on-chain element to the end-user customer experience.” Kauffman, a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, believes the future direction of marketing lies in Web 3.0 social platforms, like Farcaster and portable social graphs, which offer unique experiences and put more control back into users\u0027 hands.\n\n“Take a look at what happened with the Starbucks loyalty program,” Jeff said. “While I commend the brand and the team for the effort, ultimately, they decided to shut it down. What did they get wrong? They tried to copy/paste their Web2 program and do it in a Web3 way. They tried to make it Web3, but it just didn\u0027t work.\n\n“Web2 is the best way to run that loyalty program. If you\u0027re going to enter Web3 and use tokens and start to interact with customers on-chain, whether it\u0027s under the umbrella of loyalty or not, you must think about a net-new experience with your customers.”\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Kauffman covered how marketing is changing with Web3, where it might go next, some examples of brands pushing the envelope and what makes for good marketing strategies with brands and creators.\n\nThe following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nCan you give me some examples of brands utilizing this offline to online to on-chain framework and pushing the envelope?\n\nKauffman: Two brands that are doing well are Coinbase and 9dcc, a fashion brand started by G-Money. 9dcc is a good example of a brand that truly understands this offline, online, and on-chain brand experience and customer experience. But I\u0027ll start with Coinbase. They\u0027ve done this cool thing as a publicly traded company where they\u0027ve released their earnings report as an NFT collectible for free. Anyone can mint it, and then those who did receive discounts to their merch store, and get exclusive perks, for example, access to limited edition hats that are only available to people who minted their earnings report. This shows the connection between offline, online, and on-chain. The offline component is the merchandise (the physical goods), the online component is the shopping experience of buying or securing the goods, and the on-chain element is minting their earnings report on-chain. And with the on-chain element, what\u0027s key is that brands are putting their story on-chain.\n\nWhat enabled this?\n\nKauffman: When Web3 became a term in 2020-2021, it was kind of all about, \"Hey, we\u0027ve got this collectible, and we want people to collect this thing, and we want you to buy it, and there\u0027s a limited supply.\" Now, the transition is less about this exclusive collectible and more about all these little components that make up a brand story, everything from an earnings report to the goods you produce. And the primary driver of this is Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nA few years ago, this kind of on-chain marketing and relationship with customers wasn\u0027t possible because everything was on Layer-1 Ethereum, gas costs were expensive, and they only got more expensive. This was the era of the 10,000 PFP collections in NFTs. The costs were such that you couldn\u0027t have a million or half a million people mint your earnings report; that just wasn\u0027t feasible. Having 500,000 to 1 million people engage with you on-chain only made sense when L2s came around- Base being one of the best examples of an L2 lowering transaction costs and allowing more opportunities for on-chain engagement.\n\nWhy is being on-chain so important for brands to utilize?\n\nKauffman: The most important aspect of on-chain marketing for brands is that it gives them a direct relationship with their customers. For consumers, they have more control of the relationship because they hold and control the tokens in their wallet.\n\nThis gives brands the ability to engage their customers within any on-chain enabled experience because the token is the link in the relationship. A couple of years ago this was more theory than reality. But, now with the rise of Web3 social, we’re seeing this play out in realtime. We’re not far from the day when an on-chain user experience on the internet is much better than the user experience with today’s internet. Cheaper fees and faster transaction costs on L2s are making this possible, which is driving new product and user experience designs that are only possible with the interoperability and composability of on-chain experiences.\n\nI also wanted to ask, through your work with JUMP, what do you see the ad executives often get wrong or misunderstand about Web3?\n\nKauffman: Many of the marketers in these institutions are intelligent and capable and understand a lot about the space. But they\u0027re in handcuffs because these legacy brands and institutions were built around different marketing laws of physics. In Web3, there\u0027s a different level of physics within the ecosystems, and legacy institutions can\u0027t get out of their own way.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, so instead of taking a cookie-cutter copy/paste approach, it needs to be more conscious and intentional?\n\nKauffman: A critical question to ask is “What do we do in Web3 that we couldn\u0027t do in Web2?” And it goes back to the other question, “Why blockchain?” If you keep pushing through a hundred of those scenarios, keep asking \"why blockchain\", and realize that you don\u0027t need blockchain or Web3 to do it, well, now you\u0027ve just iteratively gone through all of the ideas that you shouldn\u0027t have launched in the first place as a Web3 initiative. You eventually get to the thing where you\u0027re like, \"Ah, this can only be done with blockchain. Now, we can definitively answer the question, why blockchain and why Web3.”\n\nLet\u0027s circle back to Web3 social and how it\u0027s influencing the future of marketing.\n\nKauffman: Yeah, absolutely. So, the most dominant player right now is Farcaster. But Zora is very close and exciting, and then you have Lens. But if you could only spend your time in one place, it\u0027s Farcaster. So what\u0027s happening here is that this Web3 social network and Web3 social in general is bringing users and content on-chain. At a high level, other apps, experiences, and brands can then tap into the social graph facilitated through Farcaster and the content on these social networks to build new experiences.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\n\nKauffman: We can use Paragraph, which is a Web3 Substack. If you have a Farcaster account and you\u0027re active and you go to Paragraph and you create your Web3 substack or blog, you\u0027ll immediately be shown your farcaster social graph, and everyone you follow on Farcaster, their paragraph accounts will be shown to you and you can subscribe and follow them. This is something we thought would happen in Web2, but, because of the walled-garden nature and because of the privacy component, because users didn\u0027t own their content and identity in these social graphs, it became difficult to make this interoperable, portable social graph, of just network connections and people connections and the content itself as well.\n\nBecause you own your Farcaster ID, that sits in your wallet along with the content you produce, now it becomes portable. Now other brands and apps can launch and tap into that social graph and content graph. And immediately pull that in, which immediately creates this element of social graphs moving around the internet together in and out these different apps and continually being connected.\n\nSo, everytime I go to use a new app that is tapping into this Web3 social protocol, everytime I go to use a new app, that app has much more utility because I am immediately able to find the other people in my Farcaster social graph who are using this app and look at what they\u0027re doing on this new app that is tapping into what Farcaster has built.\n\nGive us a sense of the future.\n\nKauffman: Let\u0027s go to 2030. Elon Musk is landing on Mars, and there\u0027s this big ephemeral moment. You have hundreds of millions of people using Web3 social media, and you could, in theory, have an app that springs up that\u0027s really tailored to that moment, as well as content consumption and the conversation that is going on at that moment. A billion people use the app, and the moment the app goes away, the app goes away.\n\nSo, Web3 social, from a marketer\u0027s perspective, is the one area if you were to ask, \"Where I am going to spend my time as a marketer,\" I would say that I am going to spend my time with Web3 social. Spend your time there, use these protocols and Web3 social platforms, and join the communities there. The ROI for your exploration and time investment is a good bet.\n\n",

The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n\n“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”\n\n“Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.\n\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n\n“Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”\n\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.\n\nHigher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.\n\nGill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.\n\n",

    "summary": "“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant,” Wintermute’s OTC desk told CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin’s halving event could increase bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting tokens such as STX, RUNE, and ORDI to rise.\n\nBitcoin-based meme coins, NFTs, and Ordinals could form part of a “barbell strategy” comprised of both technical and non-serious projects, some traders say.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\n\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\n\nCrypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n\n“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n\n“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.\n\nTHORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”\n\n“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\n\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n\n",

    "title": "CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The commodities regulator has been clear about the dangers of regulating a burgeoning industry through enforcement actions.\n\n",
    "content": "Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.\n\nIs it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?\n\nI think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled – whether it\u0027s an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority – we\u0027re seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It’s largely the lack of clarity that\u0027s really causing the tension.\n\nYou\u0027re in a minority position as a regulator who’s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you\u0027re willing to stick your neck out?\n\nPart of the reason I went into government, generally, is that – while there\u0027s a need for government in people\u0027s lives – we don\u0027t want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity – we\u0027ve made it very murky. That\u0027s not what the government should be doing. It’s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.\n\nI still think it\u0027s important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that\u0027s not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.\n\nDo you agree with Commissioner Pham’s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC\u0027s enforcement actions?\n\nCOMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It’s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it\u0027s that same kind of feeling that we shouldn\u0027t be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?\n\nI don\u0027t want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?\n\nThere are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.\n\nI\u0027m curious to what extent you\u0027re in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?\n\nThey use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It’s offering our assistance and expertise and it’s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we\u0027re able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it\u0027s impossible for the agency to implement then it’s useless.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?\n\nThere are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate – which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says “here\u0027s how to handle cryptocurrencies.”\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nBeyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That’s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There\u0027s no question that without statutory changes to ensure it\u0027s very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.\n\nI know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?\n\nWithout talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it\u0027s been whistleblower reports saying “I think somebody is violating the law.” It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don\u0027t think what they\u0027re doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We\u0027re kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.\n\nA lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There\u0027s also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it\u0027s the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there\u0027s opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they\u0027ll work together. It\u0027s more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it\u0027d be really difficult.\n\nNow one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it\u0027s a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else\u0027s money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we\u0027ve seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I\u0027d say every few years the theme changes – it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it\u0027s just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.\n\nI almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?\n\nI think when it\u0027s straight up fraud, yes. There\u0027s a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does – there\u0027s no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.\n\nBut where there\u0027s a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that\u0027s where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we\u0027re looking at a DeFi protocol, and we\u0027re saying they\u0027re violating our statute it can be difficult if we\u0027ve never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.\n\nWe’re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you\u0027ll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it\u0027s people who want to abide by the law, but there\u0027s no clear way how they would do that. That\u0027s why I think we\u0027d be better off with rulemaking.\n\nWhat do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?\n\nSo this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We\u0027ve [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we\u0027re not quite sure if there\u0027s clarity and that\u0027s dangerous.\n\nThe law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things – you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we\u0027ve said we believe this is a commodity and we\u0027re going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn\u0027t be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.\n\nGiven how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.’s FCA?\n\nI\u0027m always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you\u0027ve got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn\u0027t neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we\u0027re gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That\u0027s what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.\n\nWhy is the CFTC so against betting markets?\n\nIt\u0027s a very tough, difficult topic because there\u0027s a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it\u0027s relatively new, but we\u0027ve seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it\u0027s certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don\u0027t touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that\u0027s against federal law. There are a number of people who really don\u0027t like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.\n\nThen there\u0027s this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It\u0027s not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we’re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that\u0027s the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.\n\nSee also: \u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you\u0027re registered with us, you won’t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?\n\nYou know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven\u0027t had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There\u0027s a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don\u0027t have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn\u0027t. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they\u0027re following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that\u0027s what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone\u0027s following the rules.\n\nQuick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?\n\nI don\u0027t have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.\n\nWashington D.C.?\n\nYou know, I\u0027m gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.\n\nGary Gensler?\n\nNeutral. You know, I\u0027ve never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I\u0027ve had a chance to sit down and get to know them.\n\nThe phrase “sufficiently decentralized?”\n\nYou\u0027re either decentralized or you\u0027re not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don\u0027t know what that means. It probably means you\u0027re not decentralized.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nThe conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.\n\nThank you again for the time. Nice to meet you both.\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Radix—a layer-1 network that offers innovative upgrades to user and developer experiences in Web3 and DeFi—believes so. After a successful start to 2024, highlighted by a thriving ecosystem and growing TVL levels, Radix is gearing up for the next stage of its mass user onboarding strategy. Token Trek, built by dmany, aims to help onboard more users to the Radix community and increase network activity.\n\nThe world of decentralized finance has seen its share of ups and downs. While the potential for a more accessible, transparent and inclusive financial system is immense, adoption has been hindered by subpar user and developer experiences. To gain widespread acceptance, somebody must fix DeFi by addressing the major UX/DX roadblocks.\n\nRadix is stepping into the challenge by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure that benefits both users and developers.\n\nRadix gained momentum in late 2023 with their Babylon Mainnet upgrade. This set the stage for significant advancements within the ecosystem such as the new Radix Wallet and introducing Scrypto—an asset-oriented programming language to simplify developing secure, consumer-friendly dApps. The Babylon upgrade saw the“full-stack” approach Radix has taken with its platform, combining Scrypto with Radix Engine to pave the way for a more streamlined approach to building new DeFi applications. And the impact is already evident.\n\nIn March 2024, its Total Value Locked (TVL) skyrocketed from $30M to $53M in just 28 days, representing a 76% increase. This growth showcases the rising interest and confidence in Radix offerings as users eagerly adopt their platform for various DeFi primitives. This includes yield farming, staking and more.\n\nThis ongoing momentum has not gone unnoticed by industry experts. Recently, market research firm CryptoEQ positioned Radix alongside s other major smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. In its detailed comparative analysis, Radix emerged as the industry leader in user and developer experience. This recognition comes from various unique, native features, a focus on trust and reliability, and solutions to some of the most common UX hurdles in Web3.\n\nAnother key focus is interoperability. Recently, cross-chain liquidity DEX Maya Protocol announced its integration with Radix—approved through a vote by its community of node operators with a resounding 95% majority. Radix is not only enhancing cross-chain liquidity across major DeFi protocols, but also enabling trustless asset exchanges without compromising security. Such integrations will further open up a whole new world of opportunities for DeFi players: to grow and contribute to crucial metrics like TVL, weekly transactions and user acquisition.\n\nBut none of this is truly achievable without solid ecosystem support and strategic initiatives. Earlier, Radix launched its first $10 million liquidity booster,Project Ignition, to enhance the liquidity of wrapped USDC, USDT, wBTC and ETH. This initiative onboarded liquidity providers (LPs) to participate and have their provided liquidity matched with XRD (the token that powers the Radix ecosystem) on Ociswap, CaviarNine and DefiPlaza—effectively boosting liquidity by 2x. Through this, LPs can receive up to 20% of value upfront in XRD and earn trading fees while being protected from impermanent loss.\n\nThe benefits don’t stop there. Project Ignition also provides a 4x protection for asset outperformance. This means that LPs are protected if the crypto they provide outperforms XRD. For example, users can generate around 9% yield on their wBTC/XRD liquidity position plus 23% in SPLASH and reclaim any impermanent loss in XRD tokens.\n\nAs Radix gains traction, its wallet continues to dominate as a user-friendly gateway to its ecosystem. With over 35K downloads and growing, the Radix wallet claims that their truly human readable “transaction previews” mean that users can finally use DeFi with confidence. This focus on accessibility and ease of use is crucial for onboarding the next wave of DeFi adopters.\n\nEnter Radix’s newly unlocked growth phase with the launch of Token Trek. After first incentivizing developers and LPs, its next goal is incentivizing users. Developed by the Social Infrastructure startup Dmany, Token Trek will incentivize user interaction within the Radix ecosystem.\n\nDApps can integrate on-chain quests, making Radix a vibrant user onboarding and engagement hub. Rather than relying on superficial metrics, rewards are directed towards users who actively contribute to ecosystem growth. Such an approach supports the success of independent projects and strengthens their overall longevity and resilience.\n\nToken Trek allows for projects to allocate their marketing budgets effectively. By rewarding dedicated community members, projects stand a chance to benefit from a loyal and engaged user base. Projects can thus effectively optimize their marketing spend. This symbiotic relationship can potentially create a virtuous cycle of growth and value creation within communities.\n\nUsers will be rewarded for their gamified participation.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nThe SEC\u0027s approval of spot ether ETF regulatory filings has yet to spur a rally in crypto prices, which extended their slide during the Asian and European mornings. BTC has lost more than 3.4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $67,400 while ETH is down around 4.5% at $3,700. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), measuring the broader digital asset market, has lost over 3.3%. Ether ETFs are not yet cleared to trade, because the SEC still needs to approve their S-1 filings before investors can buy them. The approval came as a surprise to many. After clearing spot bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC didn\u0027t seem to engage much with issuers on ether ETFs, but that changed in recent days.\n\nBitcoin and ether both experienced wild swings in the run-up to the SEC\u0027s ETF decision on Thursday. ETH tumbled to $3,500 before surging to $3,900 as the first reports came through that approval of some filings was imminent. BTC, meanwhile, sank below $66,500, then spiked to $68,300 before settling just below $68,000. Liquidations across all leveraged crypto derivative positions soared to over $350 million during the day, the most since May 1, CoinGlass data shows. The bulk of the positions were longs betting on rising prices, worth roughly $250 million, suggesting that over-leveraged traders were caught off-guard by the sudden price plunge.\n\nKabosu, the Shiba Inu dog who inspired the dogecoin meme and thereafter the DOGE cryptocurrency, died at the age of 17. Kabosu’s picture inspired the creation of DOGE in 2013, initially starting off as a joke currency. DOGE’s success later birthed a whole cohort of dog-themed tokens such as SHIB and FLOKI, which have since cumulatively become one of the industry’s biggest sectors. “We will be holding a farewell party for Kabo-chan on Sunday, May 26th. It will be held at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1pm to 4pm,” her owner wrote in a blog post.\n\n- Shaurya Malwa, Jamie Crawley\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\n\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\n\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\n\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\n\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\n\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\n\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\n\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\n\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\n\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\n\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\n\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\n\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\n\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\n\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\n\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\n\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n\n",
